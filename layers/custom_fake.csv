Trump-Russia: Six big takeaways from the Flynn deal,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller just dropped the hammer. Again.

On Friday it was Michael Flynn's turn ""in the barrel"", to borrow a line from Trump confidant Roger Stone. The former national security adviser pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about December 2016 conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak and pledged to ""fully cooperate"" with Mr Mueller's ongoing investigations.

Mr Flynn has admitted he misled the FBI about his discussions regarding new sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia following evidence of alleged meddling in the 2016 election.

There had been hints this was coming, after word last week that Mr Flynn's defence lawyers had stopped co-operating with the Trump legal team. The president's own scattershot behaviour on Twitter this week could also have been a key tell, like a trick knee acting up before a big storm.

So why is this being billed as a major development in the ongoing investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia? Let us count the ways.

1) Trump's inner circle has been breached

It's difficult to overstate the significance of this felony plea deal. Mr Flynn was a close adviser and confidant of Mr Trump throughout the 2016 presidential race. He was a surrogate for the candidate on television and enjoyed a prominent speaking role at the July Republican National Convention. He had a pivotal role in Mr Trump's presidential transition.

The role of national security adviser in the White House, which Mr Flynn assumed upon Mr Trump's inauguration, is one of the senior-most positions in any administration, responsible for being the key conduit between the sprawling US military and intelligence bureaucracies and the president. It is a post that has been held by the likes of Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice.

Mr Trump was so partial to Mr Flynn that he was praising him as a ""wonderful man"" who had been ""treated very, very unfairly by the media"" just days after firing him.

Now Mr Flynn could be going to jail - and, more importantly, could be sharing damaging information about the Trump inner circle he inhabited for so long.

2) Flynn is talking

According to the Statement of the Offense filed by the special counsel's office, Mr Flynn is testifying that he had contact with Trump transition team officials before and after his fateful December 2016 conversation with Ambassador Kislyak. ""Members of the transition team,"" the document relates, ""did not want Russia to escalate the situation after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on the Russian government"".

These conversations came more than a month after Mr Trump had won the presidency. Mr Flynn had already been announced as the national security adviser in the incoming White House - a top post in the president's inner circle.

The next big question is who exactly were the unnamed senior members of the presidential transition team. Some US news outlets are naming Jared Kushner and former Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland. Others seem to indicate it was Mr Trump himself. Eventually, Mr Flynn - and Mr Mueller - will have to lay their cards on the table.

3) Flynn is contradicting the White House line

Mr Flynn's assertions about his conversations with the transition team run directly counter to statements made by Mr Trump in a February press conference, where he said Mr Flynn was acting against orders when he reached out to Mr Kislyak.

In fact, the White House said at the time that the president dismissed Mr Flynn as national security adviser because he lied to Vice-President Mike Pence about his Russian contacts. (The true nature of Mr Flynn's conversations with Mr Kislyak first came out thanks to information gleaned from government surveillance of Mr Kislyak that leaked to the press).

If Mr Flynn has evidence corroborating his account of December contacts with the Trump transition team - which was headed by Mr Pence himself - the White House's explanation for its handling of the Flynn situation, denials of knowledge and all, start to crumble.

Anyone in the president's inner circle who told the FBI or Mr Mueller's investigators that they weren't privy to Mr Flynn's activities, but there is evidence that they knew, would be open to another round of charges of lying to the FBI.

The White House response, at least so far, seems to be that Mr Flynn is a lying liar who lies.

""The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,"" White House lawyer Ty Cobb wrote in a press statement. ""Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr Flynn.""

4) Mr Mueller could be building an obstruction of justice case

Dust off that old political saw that ""it's not the crime, it's the cover-up"". While Mr Flynn's contact with the Russian ambassador is questionable, given that he was undercutting Obama administration policy efforts, it's probably not illegal.

What is illegal, however, is obstruction of justice. Former FBI Director James Comey has testified that on 14 February - the day after Mr Flynn was sacked - Mr Trump urged the director to back off his investigation into Mr Flynn during a private Oval Office meeting.

If the president knew that the ongoing law-enforcement inquiry would discover Mr Flynn had been acting under orders - either by the president or a member of his transition team - that could be the kind of motive that would help support an obstruction of justice charge.

5) Only the tip of the iceberg?

There were a lot of rumours and allegations floating around about Mr Flynn before Friday's plea deal news. The special counsel's office was reportedly looking into Mr Flynn's Obama-era work as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was scrutinising his 2015 trip to Russia, paid for by the government-backed RT network, and his undisclosed lobbying on behalf of Turkish government interests.

The charge brought against him, however, was solely related to his December 2016 phone conversations with Mr Kislyak. Although it comes with a possible five-year prison sentence, Mr Mueller hardly threw the book at the former national security adviser. Is this all there is?

Mr Mueller is primarily tasked with investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mr Flynn was a senior adviser to and advocate for Mr Trump's presidential bid. Does relative modesty of the charges against Mr Flynn indicate he may be offering information directly relevant to this inquiry?

6) The independent counsel investigation is wide-ranging

Mr Flynn's plea deal is just one piece of a much larger puzzle the special counsel office is trying to solve.

In October Mr Mueller indicted former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, a top aide with White House ties, on money laundering charges predating their involvement with the Trump campaign.

He also struck a plea deal with former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who told prosecutors he lied about his own contacts with Russians.

Each move is distinct and not directly related - at least not yet. A some point we're going to learn whether Mr Mueller is building a larger case against the Trump campaign out of these legal moves - or that the sum total of his efforts is nibbling around the edges.

As the president likes to say, stay tuned.

You’ll Be Surprised Why Hillary Clinton Is So Happy That Matt Lauer Sexually Harassed Women,"While most people are saddened to find out that a man sexually harassed women, this was not the case with Hillary Clinton and her followers after NBC’s Matt Lauer was fired. According to Hillary’s staff members, NBC and the media was really nice to Trump, but horrible to her because she is a woman. Now according to Hillary’s staff, this is a huge victory.

Peter Daou, Hillary’s former aide wrote the following: “Matt Lauer was fired today. One by one, we’re finding out the true character of the male journalists who treated Hillary Clinton (and her voters) with seething disdain.”

“I don’t think Hillary is gloating, because she’s not that person, and none of this is good for America. But I think she’s smiling at how fate is playing out.#Flynn #Mueller #TrumpRussia,” tweeted Daou.

Another former Hillary aide, and president of the Center for American Progress, Neera Tanden wrote “Another person whose interview with Trump was ridiculously soft and interview with Hillary was incredibly tough: Matt Lauer.”

What kind of world does Hillary Clinton live in to believe that the media is hard on her but easy on Trump? She most likely knows that isn’t true. But she is doing what she does best: lie. However, hundreds of Hillary fans agreed with Tanden’s tweet. “That Lauer interview with Hillary was so unfair and unprofessional that I was yelling at my TV half way through. He reeked of misogyny,” wrote one user in response.

Toys R Us prepares to shut 25 stores,"Toys R Us is preparing to close around a quarter of its 106 UK stores, with the loss of hundreds of jobs, the BBC understands.

The closures would form part of a deal to renegotiate debts owed by the company to its landlords - which must be agreed by 75% of its creditors.

The toy giant, which has around 3,000 workers, is looking to move away from its ""big-box"" out-of-town store model.

Christmas trading and gift cards are not expected to be affected.

The company is seeking approval from its board and US parent company to enter talks with the landlords.

Specialist restructuring firm Alvarez and Marsal is understood to be drafting a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) on its behalf.

It hopes to strike a deal on Toys R Us's debts which will allow it to continue trading without being pursued for the money it owes.

A Toys R Us spokesperson would not comment on the CVA proceedings, shop closures or job losses.

The CVA process is separate to bankruptcy protection proceedings involving Toys R Us's US parent company, which were announced in September.
'More to come'

Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle, from Insight With Passion, said the challenge facing Toys R Us is a common theme of retailers.

""Toy retailers, fashion retailers, everyone is going to reduce the size of their stores. It's coming. In the coming 24 months you will see a lot more of this sort of news,"" Ms Hardcastle said.

Ms Hardcastle said Toys R Us was particularly exposed to the rise in e-commerce because customers are most comfortable buying toys and electronics online as they offer big-name, trusted brands.

""There isn't a bigger branded industry. If I'm buying Lego: Lego is Lego, is Lego"".

""Toys R Us has aisles and aisles stacked high with products, but they will never win that fight with the internet.""

Ms Hardcastle said Toys R Us was stuck between the extensive range and lower pricing of online retail and the theatrics and free entertainment offered by toy stores such as Hamleys, Lego and Disney stores.

Anger as India doctor mistakenly declares newborn dead,"A newborn baby, declared dead by a hospital in the Indian capital Delhi, was found to be alive while they were on their way to his funeral. According to the twins' grandfather, the stunned family rushed the newborn to a nearby hospital where they were told that their baby was still alive, local media reported.

In a statement to reporters, Max hospital said they were ""shaken"" and ""concerned"" over the incident, and added that the doctor has been asked to go on leave, pending an inquiry.

According to ANI news agency, Delhi police have begun to investigate the case and have consulted legal experts.

This is the second instance in recent months where a private hospital in India has been called out for negligent care. Last month, a girl died of dengue fever in another hospital and the parents allege they were overcharged for her treatment. 

Doctors at the privately run Max Hospital had pronounced the baby dead hours after his twin who was stillborn.

The parents said they noticed one of the babies squirming inside the plastic bag that doctors placed the infants in.

The incident has sparked outrage and a debate over the quality of private healthcare which is often costly.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that he had ordered an inquiry into the matter. The state health minister has also described the incident as ""shocking criminal negligence"". ",REAL
Missing Florida teen found with soccer coach in New York," A missing Florida teenage girl has been found safe, authorities said Friday, nearly one week after the teen allegedly left home with a local soccer coach 10 years her senior.

Caitlyn Frisina, 17, was located in New York, authorities said Friday, with Rian Rodriguez, 27, a family friend and Frisina's father's assistant soccer coach at the high school, authorities said. It's believed she left voluntarily with him, authorities said earlier.

Around 4 p.m. Friday, a New York State Police officer in Syracuse spotted the car the two were believed to have fled in, the Columbia County Sheriff's Office. The officer pulled the car over and took Rodriguez into custody without incident, the sheriff's office said.

Frisina was detained and her family has been notified, the sheriff's office said. Rodriguez cooperated with the investigator and is currently being questioned by police, according to the New York State Police. He has not been arrested or charged with a crime at this point, and Florida authorities are en route to Syracuse, state police said.  The incident began Sunday when Frisina's parents reported her missing. She had last been seen at her home on Saturday night, authorities said. The teen's phone -- which had been completely erased -- was left behind, authorities said.

Frisina and Rodriguez were spotted on cameras in Georgia on Sunday and then at a pawn shop in Fayetteville, North Carolina.  The two were believed to be headed north, authorities said earlier this week. Frisina has family in New York and Rodriguez has family in Canada and possibly Pennsylvania, Murray Smith, public information officer for the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office, said.

Authorities said earlier this week it appeared ""a potential relationship"" was blossoming between Frisina and Rodriguez before the teen's disappearance.

Rodriguez had been working as a boys' soccer coach at Fort White High School, but was suspended pending the investigation, according to a statement from Lex Carswell, superintendent of Columbia County Schools.  Frisina has played soccer at Fort White High School, according to an online roster published by Next College Student Athlete.

Rodriguez and the teen had been around each other ""at sports events, but they've never been alone at all,"" Smith said.",REAL
ALERT: North Korea can now KILL 90% of the U.S. population (video lecture)," (Natural News) North Korea has now demonstrated the ability to strike nearly every major city in the United States with either a nuclear warhead or a high-altitude EMP weapon. At risk are hundreds of millions of Americans who would find themselves at very high risk of being killed in the aftermath of an EMP attack due to mass starvation, social unrest and the spread of disease.

In this video lecture, I cover the facts about North Korea’s current nuclear capability, explaining how the regime is now able to deliver large, weaponized payloads over very long distances. Because of this shocking advancement in North Korea’s technology — combined with Kim Jong-Un’s repeated threats to nuke specific U.S. cities — all Americans are now in the crosshairs of a nuclear-capable madman who leads a national cult of delusional followers.

Even worse, we’re running out of options. Diplomacy has never worked with North Korea, and economic sanctions aren’t halting nuclear weapons development. The only remaining option, as I explain in the video below, may be a massive military strike against North Korea’s leadership regime. Such an attack would undoubtedly produce mass casualties — perhaps up to 100,000 civilians dead. Yet if we stand by and do nothing, Kim Jong-Un might successfully knock out the bulk of the U.S. power grid, leading to perhaps as many as 300 million Americans dead within a year or less.

The world, it seems, is now being held hostage by an insane nuclear superpower run by a raving lunatic named Kim Jong-Un. Watch my full video for a detailed analysis:",FAKE
What Michael Flynn’s Guilty Plea Means in Mueller’s Russia Inquiry,"Talking sanctions with the Russian ambassador

False Statements Regarding FLYNN’s Request to the Russian Ambassador that Russia Refrain from Escalating the Situation in Response to U.S. Sanctions against Russia 3. On or about January 24, 2017, FLYNN agreed to be interviewed by agents from the FBI (“January 24 voluntary interview”). During the interview, FLYNN falsely stated that he did not ask Russia’s Ambassador to the United States (“Russian Ambassador”) to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia. FLYNN also falsely stated that he did not remember a follow-up conversation in which the Russian Ambassador stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of FLYNN’s request.

Mr. Flynn has now admitted that he lied when he told the F.B.I. that he had not discussed sanctions with Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, during the transition period. In fact, as Mr. Flynn has now acknowledged, after outgoing President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Dec. 28 imposing the sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its election interference, Mr. Flynn — at the request of an unnamed transition official — asked Mr. Kislyak for Russia to consider reacting with restraint.

Their conversations about sanctions have been well documented, and helped catalyze the chain of events that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. On Dec. 30, for example, after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced that his country would not retaliate at that time for the sanctions, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart!” On Jan. 15, Vice President-elect Mike Pence publicly denied that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak.

But soon after the F.B.I. interview in which Mr. Flynn falsely said the same thing, Sally Q. Yates, an Obama-era holdover serving as acting attorney general, warned the Trump White House that Russia could blackmail Mr. Flynn over having lied. Mr. Trump soon fired Ms. Yates over an unrelated matter, but did not act against Mr. Flynn until The Washington Post reported nearly two weeks later that intelligence officials knew that Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador had talked about sanctions, leaving Mr. Kislyak with the impression that the Trump administration would revisit the issue after taking office. Mr. Trump then fired Mr. Flynn, ostensibly for having misled Mr. Pence.

Mr. Trump later pressured James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to go easy on Mr. Flynn, according to Mr. Comey, before eventually firing him over his handling of the Russia investigation — a step that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller as special counsel.

Asking Russia to thwart U.S. policy at the U.N.

During the January 24 voluntary interview, FLYNN made additional false statements about calls he made to Russia and several other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically FLYNN falsely stated that he only asked the countries’ positions on the vote, and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. FLYNN also falsely stated that the Russian Ambassador never described to him Russia’s response to FL YNN’s request regarding the resolution.

Mr. Flynn has also admitted lying to the F.B.I. about asking Russia and several other countries for help in thwarting an Obama administration foreign policy decision to permit the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israel for building settlements in Palestinian territory. Russia nevertheless declined to delay or veto the measure, which the Security Council passed despite lobbying by Israel and the objections from the Trump transition team.

Some commentators have raised the question of whether such efforts by Mr. Flynn and the Trump transition team to lobby foreign governments in ways that conflicted with the official policy of the United States under the Obama administration before they took power were a violation of the Logan Act. That is a 1799 law that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments. But this statute has raised constitutional concerns and is generally considered a dead letter, meaning it remains on the books but is defunct.

Where will Mueller go next?

On or about December 22, 2016, a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team directed FLYNN to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.

On or about December 29, 2016, FLYNN called a senior official of the Presidential Transition Team (“PTT official”), who was with other senior members of the Presidential Transition Team at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. Sanctions.

In trying to figure out what happened with Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr. Mueller appears to be following a strategy of starting at the fringes and moving inward, pressuring people to cooperate. Mr. Flynn may, of course, have already given information to Mr. Mueller’s team that is not mentioned in these court filings. But one question raised by the documents is who the unnamed people are with whom he spoke about these matters — and what those people told federal investigators.

For example, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and close adviser, reportedly took the lead for the transition team on the United Nations Security Council resolution about Israel. Earlier this month, Mr. Mueller’s investigators interviewed Mr. Kushner about Mr. Flynn’s interactions with the Russian ambassador.

Twitter is paralysed by Trump's tweeting,"Once again, Twitter finds itself between a rock and a far-right place. In other words, the content of the videos were irrelevant to Trump's wider point, whatever that may have been. Twitter, however, considers it vital to the public interest to keep the videos online, boosted by the President to more than 40 million followers.

That's not a view shared by Brendan Cox, whose wife, the MP Jo Cox, was shot dead in 2016 by a man who shouted ""Britain first"" as he killed her.

""Spreading hatred has consequences and the President should be ashamed of himself,"" Mr Cox wrote on Twitter.

With that in mind, Twitter's safety team might want to consider whether there's greater public interest in taking the tweets down.

Inconsistency. The firm's chief executive Jack Dorsey, who from time-to-time weighs in on controversial matters to dampen the hysteria, has so far been silent on Mr Trump's retweeting of Britain first.

Renowned tech commentator John Gruber described Twitter's statement as ""weasel-ese"" - another sign of a company paralysed; unprepared to handle the tidal wave it would face were it to take action against the President's Twitter activity.

Twitter's inconsistent treatment of hate speech surely makes you consider if rather than acting in in the public's interests, it's far more concerned about its own.

It seems a lifetime ago now that Twitter billed itself, back in 2012, as the ""free speech wing of the free speech party"", a characterisation that both the company, and arguably the internet as a whole, has well outgrown.

Things were simpler for Twitter back then. Now, its reality is one where it apparently can't please anyone. While its team in San Francisco debated internally (we assume) what to do about Trump's retweeting, the head of the US communications regulator was in Washington accusing it (and other big networks) of unevenly and unfairly censoring conservative voices online.

Donald Trump’s retweeting of Britain First's Jayda Fransen on Wednesday was a truly shocking moment. The British Prime Minister said it was ""wrong"". It contributed, as one US news site put it, to Trump's ""darkest day"" as President.

Yet as Wednesday rolled into Thursday, the leader of the free world retweeting a far-right organisation became just another frightful part of what we apparently refer to as the ""new normal"".

Now perhaps the most surprising element of this spectacle isn't that the President amplified the tweets of a woman who has been fined for hate speech - but that those tweets are still there.

Volatile space

Recently Twitter has pledged to crack down on hate speech, and, more importantly, promised to be more transparent about how it goes about moderating its increasingly volatile space.

It said those who engaged in hateful behaviour, online and offline, would see their ""verified"" status removed, acknowledging that some saw the bright blue tick as badge of honour for Twitter users.The three tweets in question showed shocking video clips, though Ms Fransen's captions added context that was both inaccurate and inciteful, targeting, as Britain First usually does, Muslim immigrants.

On Thursday, Twitter said it wouldn't take any action against the tweets - though it did tag the material as ""sensitive"".

Despite its new transparency pledge, it refused to offer an explanation, or give any indication - even off the record - as to its reasoning for keeping the tweets online.

Ms Fransen, Britain First's deputy leader, remains on the platform - verified with a blue tick - despite ""offline"" behaviour that includes a fine of almost £2,000 for religiously-aggravated harassment of a stranger in the street. Ms Fransen admitted to shouting abuse at the Muslim woman, who was with her children.

When asked about Ms Fransen's tweets and status, a Twitter spokeswoman sent the BBC the following statement.

""To help ensure people have an opportunity to see every side of an issue there may be the rare occasion when we allow controversial content or behaviour which may otherwise violate our Rules to remain on our service because we believe there is a legitimate public interest in its availability.""The follow up questions are obvious. What is ""every side"" to this story? What is the ""public interest in its availability""?

Twitter said it would not offer further comment.

Irrelevant nature

One argument might be that the precise content of the videos are important to those wanting to have an informed opinion on Trump's decision - but even his own press secretary apparently disagrees with that.

""I'm not talking about the nature of the video,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders told White House reporters on Wednesday.

""I think you're focusing on the wrong thing. The threat is real, and that's what the president is talking about.""",REAL
