Europe Wanted Migrants Stopped. Now Some Are Being Sold as Slaves.,"LONDON — African migrants in Libya face “unimaginable horrors,” the United Nations human rights commissioner declared. “Despicable,” the chairman of the African Union called their treatment. Several African countries recalled ambassadors in protest. Rwanda offered the migrants assistance.

The mid-November broadcast by CNN showing what was described as African migrants being auctioned off at a Libyan slave market — for as little as $100 each, at black-market exchange rates — has set off an international firestorm. The response from the European Union, however, has been notably muted.

That may partly reflect the gratification among European Union officials over Italy’s success at reducing the influx of migrants across the Mediterranean. Italy has been helping Libyans stop them at sea or keep them in Libya, despite the dangers they face there.

Rights groups and other experts say the video of the slave market — although no surprise to many journalists or relief workers — is an uncomfortable reminder for Europe that its policies risk trapping the migrants in slave-like conditions.

“The tragic and morally unjustifiable thing about this is that European Union policy is certainly a part of why this is happening,” John Springford, who studies migration at the Center for European Reform, a research organization in London. “But whether that will lead to a change in direction, I am doubtful.”",REAL
"‘I Ask Forgiveness,’ Pope Francis Tells Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh","The Rohingya are stateless Muslims from western Myanmar who, according to the United Nations, the United States and many human rights groups, have been the targets of ethnic cleansing. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled across the border to Bangladesh, where they live in desperate, sprawling refugee camps in areas like Cox’s Bazar, where the group that met the pope had earlier sought shelter.

Francis had in the past, from the Vatican, denounced the “persecution of our Rohingya brothers,” but during his visit Monday to Thursday in Myanmar, diplomatic considerations and a fear of prompting a military crackdown on the Christian minority had kept the usually outspoken pope from uttering the term Rohingya or directly addressing the humanitarian disaster.

That uncharacteristic silence prompted criticism and frustration from those who had grown accustomed to considering the pope as a moral compass in a world that had gone adrift. The Vatican found itself refuting the notion that the pope had relinquished the moral authority that imbued his office with influence.

But as soon as the pope left Myanmar, where the Vatican hinted that he had raised the issue with the military commander, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, and the country’s de facto leader, the tarnished Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, he was more willing to broach the issue.

On Thursday night, at an event with Bangladesh’s president, he crept up to the word Rohingya, talking about Rakhine State where massacres, systematic rape and burning of villages have occurred.

But through much of Friday, he focused on his own small church in Bangladesh, with Roman Catholics numbering less than 400,000 in a densely populated, majority Muslim country of 160 million. In the morning, he celebrated Mass during which he ordained new priests and then met with church leaders, complimenting them on their attention to the poor.

“Especially in light of the present refugee crisis, we see how much more needs to be done,” he said.

Remarkably, for a pope who has consistently elevated and championed the human suffering of refugees, some supporters of Francis also thought that he could have done more during his trip.

Others understood the diplomatic minefield he had perhaps foolishly wandered into. They contented themselves with his mere presence, hoping that would be enough to draw attention to the issue.

“He had to be balanced over in Myanmar,” said Rafiqul Islam, a Muslim auto dealer in the audience who has participated in charity missions to bring blankets and clothing to the Rohingya in Cox’s Bazar. “But here he can call all the world to please, help this problem. They are butchering us.”

Before the interfaith event began, the Rohingya took their seats on green plastic chairs to the side of a stage and at the foot of a riser where the news media assembled. Reporters clamored, cameras clicked and video was taken as a little girl ate a clementine on her mother’s lap. An older girl — who said she had lost her parents, two brothers, and two uncles in the violence — sat next to them.

Abdul Fyez, 35, stared ahead with sunken eyes. “We have been Rohingya for generations, my father and my grandfather,” he said, adding that the Myanmar military had killed his brother.

Mohammed Ayub, 32, said the Myanmar military killed his three-year-old son when they attacked his village in August. “The pope should say Rohingya. He is the leader of the world,” Mr. Ayub said.

Moments later, the pope was brought by rickshaw into the tented garden of the archbishop’s residence and saluted the large crowd seated in rows on the lawn. Many of them wore the traditional dress of their Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist or Christian faiths.

“May our meeting this afternoon be a clear sign of the efforts of the leaders and followers of the religions present in this country to live together in mutual respect and good will,” the pope said, adding that he hoped that the spirit of unity would serve as “a subtle yet firm rebuke to those who would seek to foment division, hatred and violence in the name of religion.”

Throughout the trip, Francis had been making subtle asides, alluding to principles of democracy, equity and tolerance. For Francis, it seemed, the Rohingya were the endangered whose name he dared not speak. But on Friday night, toward the close of his trip, that all changed when he brought them onto center stage.

A Generation in Japan Faces a Lonely Death,"Mr. Kinoshita lived in a ground-floor “2DK” apartment — two rooms and a dine-in kitchen. Piles of old clothes, boxes, books, newspapers, empty food containers and heaps of trash blanketed the floor. A single open trail led from the bed to the toilet, passing by the only clean item in the apartment: a white T-shirt hanging from a shelf, still wrapped in the dry cleaner’s plastic.

Mr. Kinoshita was 83. His legs had grown weak. He used a “silver chair” that he rolled in front of him to steady himself. He left his apartment perhaps once a week.

After Mrs. Ito saw the state of his apartment, she alerted community leaders. Men who lived alone in the danchi, weakened by age and infirmity in apartments like that, were the most vulnerable. She learned that volunteers were already keeping an eye on him.

Months ago, after he had not been seen for a week, a volunteer went knocking on his door. There was no answer, but she could hear the television from inside. Thinking he was dead, the volunteer called the police. When Mr. Kinoshita finally woke up from a deep sleep, he was a little embarrassed, yet also relieved and maybe even a little happy that his existence had figured into someone’s thoughts.

“Thanks for your kindness,” Mr. Kinoshita liked to say in English, perhaps avoiding sentiments that were too hard to express in Japanese.

He had left Tokyo in his late 60s and moved into Tokiwadaira 14 years ago, just as the lonely deaths were becoming common. The year he moved in, Tokiwadaira recorded 15 of them. Today, volunteers have managed to reduce them to about 10 a year.

Mr. Kinoshita had lost everything before coming to the danchi. He had lost his company to bankruptcy and also the money he had borrowed from his sisters and brothers, who told him, “You’re the one who’s ruined the Kinoshita clan.” He had lost his house, and his second wife, who told him, “There’s no use staying with a husband who’d sell away our house.”

It would have been easy to see Mr. Kinoshita as just another victim of the collapse of Japan’s economic bubble. His company, I Love Industry, which worked as a subcontractor on underground construction projects — the “tail of a mouse,” he said — had ridden the country’s construction boom from the 1960s through the 1990s until public works contracts dried up.

Yet he had also enjoyed a moment of glory, one that he clung to the way Mrs. Ito clung to the Tokiwadaira in her books. During the construction of the Channel Tunnel, he had supplied a major contractor, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, with equipment — a reel for a hose — to help bore under the Strait of Dover.

Mr. Kinoshita’s large eyes lit up as he brought out his old business card, sketches of the equipment he had provided and photos of himself in his heyday: at a celebration at Kawasaki’s headquarters; on site under the Dover Strait; visiting tourist attractions in Paris during his sole visit to Europe.

There were talismans — a Eurotunnel key holder, which he held between his fingers and showed people, without ever letting go, as if he were afraid of losing it. He had commemorative medals of the tunnel’s construction, a rock fragment encased in plastic, and the T-shirt carefully preserved in dry-cleaning wrap. It had a blue and red circle with “Euro Tunnel” inside.

From his foray in Europe, he had brought back a habit of sprinkling some French words into his speech, on top of the broken English he had picked up decades earlier from a college friend.

“All over Paris, I kept hearing, ‘Merci madame,’ ” he said. “I couldn’t wait to go back to Tokyo and say, ‘Merci madame.’ ”

Mr. Kinoshita took out a large black-and-white shot of himself in his 20s, working in a rice warehouse. Wearing only a loincloth that emphasized his sinewy frame and rodlike legs, he carried three rice bags on his shoulders, totaling 400 pounds. “When I was young,” he said in English.

He was born in Taiwan, part of Japan’s colonial empire back then. His family returned after World War II to southwestern Japan, where he ate the frogs he caught in rice fields. Even in the family’s poverty and his nation’s defeat, the adolescent Kinoshita caught glimpses of a bright future in Japan’s energy and youth.

“My generation had dreams,” said Mr. Kinoshita, who went on to study mechanical engineering.

He had never imagined that his decline — and Japan’s — could be so rapid. Corporate giants like Sharp were now being taken over by a company in Taiwan, Japan’s former colony, he said with bewilderment. In 2011, when Japan was hit by a terrible earthquake and tsunami, Mr. Kinoshita rose to his feet and steadied a cabinet from toppling over. Since then, the same legs that had supported the bags of rice could barely uphold his shrinking body.

The world he knew had shrunk. He went to a health club until last year. Sitting in the Jacuzzi helped his legs, and he liked it when women came into the tub. But one day he passed out in the Jacuzzi and an ambulance was called. He came to, refused to get into the ambulance, and never returned to the health club. Now, he went out only a few times a month — to the supermarket, or to the monthly lunches where he shared a table with Mrs. Ito.

His friendship with “Madame Ito” gave him energy, though she was the one who did most of the talking. “She’s very assertive, to the point where I can’t get a word in,” he said.

He was touched that she gave him half of her lunch, and that she lent him books, though he had racier tastes. “I tend to prefer erotic books,” he said.

On a rare trip outside Tokiwadaira, Mr. Kinoshita took the train to Tokyo. He brought back Hershey’s chocolate bars for Mrs. Ito and for the volunteer who had come knocking on his door. Mr. Kinoshita called her “Madame Eleven.”

He was hoping to make copies of his Eurotunnel T-shirt for Madame Ito and Madame Eleven. He had bought a dozen during his trip to Europe, but the one in the dry-cleaning wrap was his last.

"Trump’s Tweets Manage a Rare Feat: Uniting Britain, in Outrage","Meeting in Parliament, lawmakers were unanimous in saying Mr. Trump, by giving a platform to the fringe group Britain First, had gone too far.

The chorus began after Stephen Doughty, a Labour lawmaker from Wales and the grandson of an American G.I. who came to Britain in 1944 to fight Germany, used a parliamentary maneuver to call an urgent debate on “Britain First, online hate speech and the sharing of inflammatory content online by the president of the United States, Donald Trump.”

The government minister present, Amber Rudd, the home secretary, made no attempt to defend Mr. Trump, though she observed that sharing intelligence with the Americans “has undoubtedly saved British lives.”

Members of the opposition Labour Party had been among the first to pounce on Mr. Trump’s tweets, but they were joined on Thursday by several members of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party.

One of them, Peter Bone, called on Mrs. May to persuade Mr. Trump to delete his Twitter account. Another, Tim Loughton, urged Twitter to take down Mr. Trump’s account “as it would that of any other citizen of the world who peddled such hate.”

A third Conservative lawmaker, Paul Masterton, lamented, “Just because somebody stops using Twitter, it does not mean that they cease to be a twit.”

Remarkably, a Parliament that in February debated whether to deny Mr. Trump a state visit because, among other reasons, it could embarrass Queen Elizabeth II, found itself taking on that question once again.

For Mrs. May, the episode has been simultaneously an embarrassment, a diplomatic setback and a lesson in just how hard it is to manage her relationship with Mr. Trump, a leader she has tried hard to cultivate.

Britons pride themselves on their “special relationship” with the United States and, this week, basked in the announcement of the engagement of Prince Harry to the American Meghan Markle.

But by the middle of the week Mr. Trump had knocked news of the royal wedding off the front pages, replacing it with a renewed discussion of whether a state visit to Britain should be scrapped.

Mr. Khan — the London mayor who was involved in a separate dispute with Mr. Trump after a terrorist attack in his city — suggested on Twitter that the president should not be invited for any official visit to Britain, let alone one with full pomp and ceremony.

And in the House of Commons, a Labour lawmaker, Paul Flynn, argued that Mr. Trump should be arrested for incitement to racial hatred if he set foot in Britain.

Criticism swelled well beyond Parliament, encompassing figures such as the comedian John Cleese, and Brendan Cox, the husband of the Labour lawmaker, Jo Cox, who was murdered by a right-wing extremist last year.

In Britain, ministers sought to contain the diplomatic impact of the episode, emphasizing the importance of the close security and intelligence relationship between the two countries. Nevertheless, Britain’s ambassador in the United States, Kim Darroch, wrote on Twitter that he had raised concerns with the White House.

The controversy followed Mrs. May to Jordan. On an official visit there, she sought to thread the needle, criticizing Mr. Trump but maintaining that his state visit would go ahead.

“I am very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,” she said at a news conference, adding: “The invitation for a state visit has been extended, and has been accepted. We have yet to set a date.”

On Thursday evening, a White House official said that no visit to Britain was “currently on the books,” but added that American officials were working with their British counterparts to arrange one.

That invitation to Mr. Trump was unusual in that it was extended soon after his inauguration. A state visit is an honor normally offered much later in a presidency. More than 1.8 million people signed a petition against a visit, and opponents promised protests if one were to take place.

Even before the latest uproar, there was speculation that the state visit was being pushed into the long grass. Instead, it was said, Mr. Trump was likely to make a brief, less formal visit, perhaps to coincide with the opening of the new United States Embassy building in London. Even this may now be threatened.

For Mrs. May, whose government has suffered two recent cabinet resignations, the dispute is another unexpected headache. She has to manage the anger provoked by Mr. Trump at home, including that expressed by a Muslim member of her own cabinet, Sajid Javid, who tweeted a strong condemnation on Wednesday of Mr. Trump’s decision to share the videos.

Yet with Britain scheduled to quit the European Union in 2019, Mrs. May is hoping to strike an early trade deal with Washington to compensate for a probable reduction in British access to markets in continental Europe.

The position Mrs. May finds herself in with Mr. Trump, while uncomfortable, is not unfamiliar. When Tony Blair was prime minister, he discovered that tying his fortunes too closely to those of a conservative American president could be costly. His relationship with George W. Bush, and his decision to support the invasion of Iraq, effectively wrecked Mr. Blair’s political reputation in Britain.

On many issues, Mrs. May has found Mr. Trump an awkward counterpart, and discovered that her government is much closer to the European Union’s positions than to those of the United States on a range of foreign policy questions, particularly on climate change and relations with Iran.

In contrast, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has managed to keep a distance from the United States on policy issues while also hosting Mr. Trump on a successful visit to Paris.",REAL
"A War Criminal Drank Poison in Court, and Died. How Could This Happen?","Nika Pinter, his lead counsel, said in a telephone interview from Zagreb, the Croatian capital, that Mr. Praljak had told his family not to be present at the judgment.

“For 13 years his wife came to visit him in prison every month, the last time I think at the end of October. His stepson and stepdaughter would also visit,” Ms. Pinter said. However, she added, “He forbade his wife to listen to the judgment. And he told her: Don’t come to The Hague.”

Ms. Pinter recalled: “Last weekend I called him and asked him if he would like me to visit him before the judgment. He said: ‘No, don’t come.’ I called again on Tuesday and told him I would come to court early to meet him. He told me: ‘No, don’t come. I’ll see you in the courtroom.’” She said she believed he wanted to spare her from what followed.

“From the start, 13 years ago, he told me he could not bear being called a war criminal,” Ms. Pinter said. “He couldn’t live with the stigma.” But she added: “He never gave a hint that he was planning to end his life.”

Mr. Praljak had been a theater and film director and a writer. He joined the Croatian Army and was named a general when it was formed after the country broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991.

Named commander of the Croatian forces fighting in Bosnia, he was a key figure during the conflict, including the long siege and shelling of the ethnically mixed city of Mostar. At the time, he was the main liaison between political and military leaders in Croatia and the Croatian force fighting in Bosnia.

He surrendered to the tribunal in 2004 and was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity in 2013. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but appealed. (He would have been due for release in 2019, after serving two-thirds of his sentence, including time served.)

The tribunal had just affirmed his verdict and sentence on Wednesday when Mr. Praljak kept standing.

He reached forward to pick up the vial.

“Slobodan Praljak is not a war criminal,” he declared portentously, in Croatian. “I reject your judgment with contempt.”

He then opened his fist, took out the vial, tilted back his head and drank.

“I have taken poison,” Mr. Praljak said. One of his lawyers, Natacha Fauveau Ivanovic, called out to ensure that the presiding judge, Carmel Agius, understood: “Mr. President, our client says he took poison.”

The judges were stunned, but appeared not to have fully grasped what had happened. Judge Agius directed the next defendant to rise, and began reading.

“People did not realize exactly what was going on,” said Michael Karnavas, a veteran defense lawyer representing Jadranko Prlic, one of Mr. Praljak’s co-defendants. “This man was always full of bravado. Prajlak sat down and almost immediately he was gasping for air, struggling to breathe. It was loud. He made sounds like he was choking. I saw him slumped in his chair. Someone shouted for help. The guards came over and got him onto the floor.”



Mr. Karnavas added: “After a few minutes two medics arrived from the medical office in the tribunal. One of the medics calls out: The heart has stopped. They start doing CPR, they are pumping his chest to get his heart going, taking turns with some of the security guards.”

After 20 minutes, an emergency team arrived from a local hospital and took over. They kept him in the building for another 40 minutes or so because they wanted to stabilize him. It was not clear what made the medical team finally decide to take him to the hospital. Croatia’s justice minister has called into question the speed of the responses by security and medical staff.

The tribunal said on Friday that its inquiry would be led by Hassan B. Jallow, the chief justice of Gambia and a former prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

A report on the findings is expected by Dec. 31.

It was unclear to what extent those findings would be open to scrutiny. “The outcome of the review will be made public, subject to due process and confidentiality considerations,” the tribunal said.

To smuggle the vial into the courtroom, Mr. Praljak had to circumvent what were supposed to be tight security arrangements. The defendants are escorted by guards and enter the building through an underground parking lot. They are strip-searched when they leave the detention unit and then again at the court. They are unable to have contact with members of the public.

Visitors also face tough security checks, said Ms. Fauveau Ivanovic, the defense lawyer, first to enter the high-security Dutch prison, and then again at the United Nations detention unit set within the compound.

“Everything — our shoes, our clothes, our bags — everything goes through the X-ray machine,” she said. “We walk through a scanner, like at an airport. We can’t bring in liquids.”

Mr. Karnavas recalled seeing Mr. Praljak just before the fatal court hearing. “I last saw him outside the courtroom that morning as he was coming out of the toilet,” he said. “I thought nothing of it at the time. But I’m thinking about that now.”",REAL
Former U.S. Marine Gets Life in Prison for Okinawa Rape and Murder,"Photo

TOKYO — A court on the Japanese island of Okinawa sentenced a former United States Marine to life in prison on Friday after convicting him of the rape and murder of a 20-year-old Japanese woman.

The former Marine, Kenneth Franklin Shinzato, 33, confessed to raping Rina Shimabukuro and abandoning her body in Uruma, an Okinawa village, in April of last year, Kyodo News reported.

At the time of the killing, Mr. Shinzato, who served in the Marines from 2007 to 2014, was a civilian working for a contract company on Kadena Air Base, an American military installation on Okinawa. He denied an intent to murder.

The case stoked extreme anger on Okinawa, where about 47,000 American troops are stationed. It also drew an outraged protest from the Japanese government. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised the case in an uncharacteristically public display of anger during then-President Barack Obama’s trip to Japan last May for a Group of 7 summit meeting and a visit to Hiroshima.

"Pumping New Life into Israel’s Labor Party, From the Right","But he has done it, in large part, by irritating those same liberals. Whether by design or by accident, Mr. Gabbay keeps popping off in ways that appeal to the right, not to the left. He spurned the idea of a coalition with Arab parties in the Knesset, saying they represented the constituents of the Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, not Israeli Arabs. Mr. Gabbay welcomed a beefing up of religious content in public schools. He pooh-poohed the evacuation of West Bank settlements for the sake of peace with the Palestinians.

And he dusted off an old Netanyahu insult about how “the left has forgotten what it means to be Jewish.”

Mr. Gabbay now insists he was merely making a point about how to woo the more traditional Israelis who want to feel that they share the same values, not just policy views, with their leaders. “I respect everybody, whether they believe or don’t believe,” he said while campaigning last month in Haifa. “But I believe that we have to talk about our Jewish identity. That’s the main thing that unites us all.”

The remark was a dog whistle for the right-of-center voters that Mr. Gabbay hopes to peel away from Mr. Netanyahu, said Yehuda Ben-Meir, a veteran of right-wing governments who now tracks public opinion for the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.

“The left went crazy,” Mr. Ben-Meir said, “but the right paid attention.”

Mr. Gabbay seems pleased by the attention he is getting, critical or not, though he welcomes it nonchalantly, as if it were a matter of simple math.

Indeed, there is a directness to him, from the coolheaded way he fields questions from voters — listening to them all, to gauge the room, before patiently answering each — to how he decided to run in the first place.

His unlikely path began in the executive suite at Bezeq, Israel’s state-owned telecommunications company, where his father had been a technician. Named its chief executive in 2007, Mr. Gabbay led the company through six years of deregulation, privatization and profit, firing a whole layer of managers so gently, according to one account, that they left his office smiling.

After trying to buy El Al, the national airline, Mr. Gabbay, by now a multimillionaire, helped found the center-right Kulanu party in 2015 and then, when it joined Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition, became environmental minister.

He had some successes, but he got no help from Mr. Netanyahu in cutting regulation, he complained, and was the lone vote in the cabinet against a big natural gas deal, which he said would cost consumers far too much.

All the while, he said, he watched Mr. Netanyahu sowing division and hatred at his Sunday cabinet meetings. “Every week it’s like something against somebody,” Mr. Gabbay said in an interview. “It’s against the left, it’s against the media, against Arabs, and against, against, against.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

His final straw was Mr. Netanyahu’s appointment of Avigdor Lieberman, a hard-line nationalist with few relevant qualifications, as defense minister.

“You have to know something about” defense, Mr. Gabbay said, adding: “It’s not like being a minister of environmental protection.”

So in May 2016, Mr. Gabbay quit.

After retreating to Mykonos in Greece, toting biographies of the former prime ministers David Ben-Gurion and Menachem Begin, Mr. Gabbay said he decided to run for prime minister himself to change the political culture in Israel, something that he says can only be achieved from the very top.

He chose Labor as his vehicle like a motorhead snapping up a wreck to restore: Its poll ratings were at record lows, and it was projected to win only eight of 120 Knesset seats. “People told me, ‘You are crazy,’” he said. “‘You are going to join this corpse? Seriously?’”

They may not have appreciated his endurance. A veteran of eight marathons, with a tattoo of a runner under his suit, he barely caught his breath after the primary before beginning his campaign for prime minister, even though an election could be a year or two away.

To Mr. Gabbay, the biggest problem with Mr. Netanyahu, and what will make it difficult to topple him, is his exploitation of identity politics, all too easy in Israel’s fractured society. “The mission of a prime minister is to be a prime minister of all the people in the country — not your camp, your side,” he said.

That said, Mr. Gabbay, a son of Moroccan immigrants who spent his early years in a transit camp, can hope for support from other Mizrahi Jews, whose resentments have been a powerful force in the past. “I am coming from the people, I am not from the elite,” he said. His wife is a teacher; a brother drives a taxi. He would doubtless be the first prime minister who once waited tables in the Knesset cafeteria.

A self-declared social democrat, he assails dog-eat-dog capitalism and pledges to repair the safety net and solve the country’s critical shortage of affordable housing. “We have to change Israel from a country where people just survive,” he said, “to one where people actually live.”

He promises to tackle corruption, and wants to give preferential treatment to military veterans, and not press ultrareligious men into service. “I am coming from a position of ‘in favor of,’ not ‘against,’” he said, comparing himself with rivals who “are against the Arabs and Haredim. I am in favor of my kids.”

The distinction, he added, was not lost on the Orthodox: “They like it very much.”

While he supports a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Gabbay refuses to say what he’d give up for peace, only discussing what he wants to get — a demurral that is likely to be tested in the coming week in meetings in the United States, including a high-profile turn at the Saban Forum in Washington.

Many Israelis find it hard to distinguish between Mr. Gabbay’s positions and those of Mr. Lapid, a former television host and minister who is again second to Mr. Netanyahu in more recent polls. Dahlia Scheindlin, a pollster for Labor in 2015, said politicians with greater skills than Mr. Gabbay had tried that before, but found too few center-right voters to chase. Labor, so identified with the left, she said, “practically doesn’t exist in their eyes.”

But between them, Mr. Gabbay and Mr. Lapid could possibly steal enough support from the right to deny it an automatic majority. And Mr. Gabbay, while insisting he would win, also concedes he would be willing to serve under Mr. Lapid.

For younger Laborites, who barely remember the party’s most recent victory, in 1999, the excitement surrounding Labor is intoxicating.

“He’s not like the old left wing,” said Oren Idel, 23, a student at the Technion university in Haifa. “He’s a new Labor. I think he will bring a lot of voters back to us. He gives me a strong feeling that he’s someone we can trust.”",REAL
Anglican Minister Urges Prayers for Prince George to Be Gay,"Photo

LONDON — A prominent Anglican cleric and gay rights campaigner known for contentious gestures has urged believers to pray for Prince George — age 4, and third in line to the throne — to find the love “of a fine young gentleman” when he grows up so as to advance the cause of same-sex marriage in church.

Coming just days after Prince Harry — George’s uncle, and fifth in line — announced his engagement to Meghan Markle, a divorced American actress, the suggestion by the Very Rev. Kelvin Holdsworth seemed to illuminate once more the role of royal romance in Britain’s imagination and conversation, especially when it collides with tradition.

Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have said they will marry in May at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, west of London. But it is only since 2002 that the Church of England has permitted church marriages for divorced people, “in exceptional circumstances” at the discretion of parish priests. The church teaching is that marriage is for life.

While same-sex marriage is permitted by law in most of Britain, the Church of England says on its website, “it remains the case that it is not legally possible for same-sex couples to marry” in its churches.

Is Corsica the Next Catalonia? Nationalists Are Poised for Election Win,"Corsica, with its strong indigenous culture and language, closer to the Italians who ruled it for centuries than to the French, has always had an ambivalent relationship to the mainland. Over the decades, Paris has cultivated a policy of purse-lipped silence, punctuated by irritation, faced with the island’s demands for more autonomy.

Yet Sunday’s first round of elections to the territorial assembly in Corsica is predicted to be a crowning moment for over 40 years of Corsican nationalism.

In that time, the nationalist movement has passed through all the classic stages: anti-government violence, the political consolidation of “autonomists” and “independantists,” and now likely electoral victory for the combined Pé a Corsica (For Corsica) list of nationalists in a newly created, more powerful assembly.

Such a victory would be the second in a row for the nationalists, who first came to power in 2015, and now seem set to consolidate their hold.

“We’ve forgotten nothing about taking our country out of the night into which France has plunged us!” the nationalist leader Jean-Guy Talamoni threatened on Wednesday to the fervent and youthful crowd in this university town, high up in the vertiginous Corsican mountains.

Mr. Talamoni, president of the Corsican assembly, believes independence is the restive Mediterranean island’s destiny and speaks proudly of going to Barcelona “a few times a year.”

France appears not to be listening. On the eve of the election, President Emmanuel Macron was busy in Africa and his interior minister was making tough statements about migrants, not Corsica.

The French government has shown no sign of fearing a domino effect set off by Catalonia, even though Mr. Macron’s own party appears to be trailing the nationalists in the run-up to Sunday’s vote.

The nationalist rallies are packed. Even Marine Le Pen’s National Front — she took Corsica in the first round of presidential voting last spring — struggles to attract sympathizers.

Even so, Mr. Talamoni recognizes that an immediate referendum on independence would be a non-starter in Corsica, with its weak, tourism-dependent economy.

“We’ve been impoverished by the policies that they” — meaning Paris — “have imposed,” said Mr. Talamoni, who doubles as a literature professor at the university, in an interview at a cafe here.

Corsicans will likely vote for the nationalists, “but they won’t vote for independence until they are assured of material stability,” said Mr. Talamoni, a pensive stubble-faced expert on Pascal Paoli, the 18th-century hero of Corsican independence, whose experiment in constitutional government influenced contemporary Americans.

Still, the lack of reaction from the mainland is intensely frustrating to the nationalist leaders here, spurring them to redouble their campaign efforts so that Paris will notice a large victory.

For nearly four decades, the conflict has been marked by bombings, shootings, hundreds of arrests, and “blue nights” when police lights illuminated the wild Corsican maquis, as the island’s fragrant scrub is called.

Now, it seems, there will be ballot-box validation. Could the result of it all be no more than a yawn from Paris? It seems so.

“It’s not indifference, it’s hostility,” said Gilles Simeoni, head of Corsica’s executive council, and leader of the nationalists’ “autonomist” wing.

An ex-mayor of one of the island’s two major cities, Bastia, Mr. Simeoni is the former lawyer for Yvan Colonna, who was convicted of the 1998 murder of a government-appointed prefect, Claude Erignac.

The killing was considered the gravest act of anti-state violence in the four-decade conflict. To this day the nationalists regard Mr. Colonna as a “political” prisoner” — a category not recognized on the mainland.

“There’s no room for demands like ours in the French framework,” Mr. Simeoni said.

Those demands — more fiscal autonomy, control over the island’s education system, a greater say in developing the underpopulated, impoverished interior — seem very far from being realized, for now. “The state is silent and paralyzed,” Mr. Simeoni said.

“People are saying, ‘At least when we had bombs, they listened to us,’ “ Mr. Simeoni said, only half joking. Some 30 militants remain in French prisons, he said.

Mr. Simeoni is credited with pulling in centrist voters by giving the nationalists a moderate face, and ending the patronage and clientelism that had dominated the island’s politics for decades.

“There’s been a ‘massification’ of nationalism, it’s a nationalism that is now inclusive,” said Thierry Dominici, a Corsica expert at the University of Bordeaux. “Everyone seems to be able to recognize themselves in it. And all the state can do is acknowledge this.”

He called Mr. Simeoni the “Corsican Macron, Macron with Corsican sauce” for having marginalized the traditional political parties.

The nationalists have given up on violence — the independence movement FLNC ceremoniously laid down arms in 2014.

But Mr. Simeoni, at the rally here this week, was careful to pay tribute to the militants who sustained the movement for years, implicitly saluting those who planted the bombs and blew up the villas of the “continentals.”

Some were in the audience listening to him, like a grizzled, pony-tailed 65-year-old nurse named Dumé, who said he was proud of all the houses he had brought down (and did not want his full name used because of it).

“Sure, we did a lot against the colonizers,” he said. “Our slogan was, “French Get Out!”’ — a slogan still scribbled in Corsican on the walls of the university here, “IFF,” I Francesi Fora.

“We were impregnated with that struggle,” Dumé said. That night’s rally at Corte was “a lot of emotion for us,” he said. “It shows that 40 years of struggle were not in vain.”

The crowds at these nationalist rallies are varied, from ex-bankers to wine growers to roadway maintenance workers to teachers. But in striking contrast to the National Front rally crowd, there are many young as well.

Their presence bolsters the argument of the nationalist leaders that their politics represents a wave Paris will have to reckon with in the years to come.

“They have all the young people behind them,” said Alexandra Bischof, a 22-year-old communications student at the rally in Corte. “They incarnate Corsica, and they incarnate the future.”

“Sure I’m for independence,” she added. “I want to be free. To no longer be French. We’re Corsican. We’re not French, not at all.”",REAL
Canada’s Supreme Court Backs Indigenous Rights in Dispute Over Yukon Wilderness,"Photo

In a victory for indigenous groups, Canada’s Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the Yukon territorial government could not rewrite a plan to protect a vast stretch of wilderness because a joint indigenous-government commission had already agreed to it.

In trying to revise the plan, the court said in a unanimous ruling, the territorial government violated 30-year-old treaties between the government and indigenous groups, which gave those groups a role in deciding how their traditional lands should be managed.

The decision marks the end of a long legal fight between indigenous First Nations and the Yukon government over the fate of 26,000 miles of the Peel Watershed, a pristine region of mountains and rivers that also has huge deposits of coal, gas and minerals.

The decision will have broad ramifications for Canada’s indigenous reconciliation efforts, said Gordon Christie, a professor of aboriginal law at the University of British Columbia.

The joint commission, which was made up of appointees from the First Nations and the Yukon government, spent seven years negotiating with both sides before presenting a final recommendation in 2011 to set aside 80 percent of the wilderness for conservation, with the rest allotted for road construction and resource extraction. But in 2014, the Yukon government rejected the commission’s plan and adopted its own version, which would have opened more than two-thirds of the area to industrial development.",REAL
"Turkey Seizes Assets of Reza Zarrab, Witness in Sanctions-Evasion Case","Photo

Turkish prosecutors on Friday ordered the seizure of assets belonging to an Iranian-Turk gold trader who has been a key witness in the Manhattan trial of a Turkish bank executive accused of violating United States sanctions on Iran, Turkish state media reported.

The order cited a part of the Turkish penal code that addresses the leaking of state secrets. It came a day after the witness, Reza Zarrab, testified in Federal District Court that he was told in 2012 by a Turkish official that Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister, ordered two Turkish banks to participate in a billion-dollar sanctions-busting scheme.

Mr. Zarrab, 34, entered a secret guilty plea in October to conspiring to evade the sanctions and other charges, and, in a bid to reduce his punishment, agreed to assist prosecutors. Mr. Zarrab, whose plea agreement was reported this week in court, testified on Wednesday that “cooperation was the fastest way to accept responsibility and to get out of jail at once.”

A newly unsealed transcript of Mr. Zarrab’s plea hearing shows that when he appeared before Judge Richard M. Berman on Oct. 26, he gave a detailed admission of his crimes, saying that from 2010 until his arrest in 2016, he conspired with others to obstruct the Treasury Department’s enforcement of the Iran sanctions.

He also admitted that while being jailed in Manhattan, he bribed a correctional officer in return for alcohol and the use of a cellphone. He ultimately pleaded guilty to seven charges.

Motives in Egypt’s Deadliest Terrorist Attack: Religion and Revenge,"Bir al-Abed has long been one of the most pro-military towns in Sinai, going back as far as the uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, local leaders say. After militants and criminals stormed police stations and seized weapons during the uprising, residents took the weapons and returned them to the authorities in 2014 after they regained control of the area. Hundreds of young men from the area apply for police and military service every year, although they are routinely rejected, local officials say, because the state distrusts Bedouins.

“They love the military and the state,” Mr. Saad said. “The terrorists wanted to punish them for this.”

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Islamic State had singled out the town for destruction, and the attackers carried Islamic State flags.

The government has not allowed foreign media into Bir al-Abed so The New York Times interviewed more than 30 residents, security officials and local political and clerical leaders by phone for this article. Several spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals by the militants.

New details of the attack also emerged.

As the militants began to rake the congregation with machine-gun fire, two boys, ages 10 and 15, cowered in a bathroom stall, listening, petrified, to the screaming and gunfire.

After a while, two militants entered the restroom to make sure they had not missed anyone. “How many people did you kill?” one asked, as they kicked open each stall, the boys’ mother said.

Photo

“A hundred,” the other replied.

Just before they reached the stall where the boys were hiding, a third militant walked in and told the others to position themselves elsewhere, the mother said. The boys survived.

The attack came after more than a year of escalating tensions between Islamic State militants and the Sufi residents of Al Rawda, a district in Bir al-Abed. The campaign began in November last year with the beheading of a blind, elderly Sufi cleric from the nearby town of El Arish, who was accused of practicing witchcraft.

Three weeks later, in an interview published in an Islamic State magazine, one of the group’s commanders in Sinai derided Sufi practices as “sorcery and soothsaying,” and identified Al Rawda and two other predominantly Sufi districts as places the group intended to “eradicate.”

Attacks on three Sufi shrines in the district soon followed.

“Every time they build one, the militants destroy it,” said Fakri Ismail, whose brother was killed in the attack. “The threats started after that.”

The militants began sending text messages to tribal elders and distributing fliers telling people to abandon Sufism and “return to Islam.”

They called some residents by phone and threatened to kill them if they did not abandon Sufi rituals like the building of shrines and the worship of saints, which they consider polytheistic.

They twice attacked the home of a beloved cleric, Sheikh Hussein el-Greir.

And they regularly sent men to the mosque to demand that the imam preach jihad. He refused.

Most people were too afraid of the militants to report them, but some of Al Rawda’s elders complained to the police.

These complaints were not ignored, but the authorities prioritized other security operations in the area, local officials said. No one thought the militants would attack a mosque, they said.

The military had been improving ties with Bedouin leaders across Sinai this year. In October, the Tarabin tribe, one of the biggest in Sinai, announced that it would help the military hunt down Islamic State operatives.

Shortly after the announcement, several local residents who were believed to be cooperating with the government in Al Rawda and elsewhere were killed. In November, 14 men from central Sinai were kidnapped and interrogated by the Islamic State over accusations that they had been informers for Egyptian security.

At the same time, the Islamic State was in upheaval. As its once vast caliphate in Iraq and Syria crumbled, it was forced to rely more on other franchises, like the one in Sinai, to spread its tactics of sectarian hate and division. The Sinai group, which arose after the Egyptian military overthrew the country’s Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013, was considered one of its most effective affiliates, responsible for shooting down a Russian jetliner in 2015, killing 224 people.

Photo

But it had since split into two factions, and this division, according to security officials and residents, may go furthest in explaining the wholesale carnage of the mosque attack.

After the group tried and failed to take over a town in eastern Sinai in 2015, the military carried out a devastating air campaign, leaving the group in disarray and sending a weak, splinter group west to El Arish. The El Arish group began taking recruits from outside the region — from mainland Egypt as well as neighboring countries like Syria, Sudan and Libya — who had no tribal ties to the Bedouins of Al Rawda.

“The attack on the mosque was almost certainly carried out by the El Arish group,” said Ahmed Sakr, a former senior Sinai official and an expert on the militancy there. The main Islamic State Sinai group “would not approve” of the mass killing, he said, “but the Arish people are happy to kill anyone and everyone.”

Even in a land tormented by violence, the scale of the attack on the Rawda mosque last Friday was stunning.

More than two dozen gunmen traveling in five vehicles stormed the mosque when it was at its most crowded, during Friday Prayer, exploding a bomb and then spraying the worshipers with gunfire.

Militants positioned themselves outside the mosque and its windows to mow down people who tried to flee. Parked cars were set on fire to hinder escape.

The imam who had refused to preach jihad survived by hiding under the bodies of two friends and playing dead, he said. At one point, he said, a militant stood on top of him to make sure he was really dead.

After they killed as many people as they could at the mosque, including 27 children, some militants went house to house, killing any man they found.

Residents and experts say there may have been another reason for the high death toll.

Despite the fact that there are three government security installations within 12 miles of the mosque, ambulances arrived at the scene well before the police and the military forces did, residents and victims said. They attributed the delay to a widespread presumption, even among some security officials, that Egyptian security forces fear armed conflict.

The spokesmen for the police and the military could not be immediately reached for comment.

“Regardless of how you look at it, the government could have done more,” Mr. Sakr said.

After the gunfire stopped, the boys emerged from the bathroom to find their mother wailing as she flipped over their dead neighbors and friends to search for her husband. She found his body lying over their 5-year-old son. The father, 52, had taken a bullet to the head but apparently saved the child.

“We were standing in a sea of corpses,” said the mother, 38. “If it were not for my husband’s body, I would have lost my son. The terrorists can have Al Rawda, Friday Prayer and everything else. We are staying home.”",REAL

In San Francisco, an undocumented Mexican immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges in the killing of Kathryn Steinle, whose death was invoked by Mr. Trump as justification for his hard-line immigration agenda. After a five-week trial, the man was convicted only of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Ms. Steinle’s death on the city’s Pier 14, above, also fed a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status — the shooter had been deported five times — should be dealt with more aggressively.

Mr. Trump called the verdict “disgraceful,” and renewed his call to build a wall on the border with Mexico.

The Times has extensively reported on the work of Geoffrey Everest Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who is affiliated with Google and also largely responsible for making Toronto a global center for work on artificial intelligence.

As we all know A.I. has become the tech industry’s next big thing. The voice inside your smartphone uses it to answer your questions. But it has largely been based on neural networks, a concept that’s been around for decades and which has limitations.

Mr. Hinton has now come up with a new approach to A.I. He used a puzzle to demonstrate it to my colleague Cade Metz, who reports on emerging technologies for The Times. While it only has two blocks and initially appears to present little or no challenge, the puzzle’s solution defied Mr. Metz as well as, he reported, some leading academics.

By the way, Sara Sabour, Mr. Hinton’s co-researcher, is an Iranian who lives and works in Canada because the United States once denied her a visa to study there.

China’s Next Potential Boom Spot: The Places People Overlook,"In the prefecture that contains Liangduo, Yancheng, locals’ wallets are fattening more quickly than the national rate, and their household spending — which surged 8 percent per person in 2016 — outpaced the rises in Beijing and Shanghai.

Signs of that new prosperity can be seen at Auto City, a jumble of ramshackle, boxy buildings in Yancheng where Toyota, Ford and just about every other major brand compete for customers. Zhou Zhengguo, owner of a dealership for the Chinese automaker Geely, expects to sell 2,000 cars this year, four times more than just two years ago.

“Most people who bought cars were private businessmen,” Mr. Zhou said. “Now working-class people buy, too.”

Those who live in China’s less developed places could be crucial to the next stage of China’s development.

Robin Xing, an economist at Morgan Stanley, believes consumer spending in places like Yancheng’s urban center will continue to outperform bigger cities. As a result, two-thirds of all additional private consumption growth will come from these less developed areas through 2030.

“We do expect them to catch up, to narrow the income gap with the large cities,” Mr. Xing said.

Businesses are looking at such areas in a new light. New highways and high-speed railways make relocating factories and other operations into smaller cities easier, allowing companies to take advantage of their lower costs. Industrial output in Yancheng expanded more quickly than the national rate last year.

The gains are not limited to the hinterland’s main towns. Farms are becoming bigger, more efficient and more lucrative.

In Xinling, a nearby village, Luo Jianhai, 37, is typical of a new breed of farmer-entrepreneur. He has steadily expanded the farm where he tills rice and wheat by renting land from his neighbors. He also invested in two new tractors, which he lends out to other farmers who need them to work their own larger plots. Over the past three years his annual income has increased seven times, to $100,000, and his spending has quadrupled, mainly on higher-quality clothing for his three children and a new, $17,000 car from a General Motors joint venture.

His improved lifestyle, Mr. Luo said, “is the difference between being poor and having money.”

Nearby, Cheng Zhiguo, 47, also enlarged his farm this year, increasing his net income to about $23,000 — five times greater than just three years ago. His reward: his first car, a Hyundai, bought in August.

Such change is luring urban entrepreneurs such as Zhou Jian. Mr. Zhou, a 33-year-old resident of Nanjing, a major city in eastern China, figured that large-scale farming would also need more money. In 2013, he founded Nongfenqi E-Commerce Company, which helps arrange loans for farming families from banks and other lenders.

Nongfenqi has since arranged about $150 million in loans, opened more than 100 offices spread around rural China and hired 800 employees. “The upgrading of the market allows businesses like us to serve these big farmers,” Mr. Zhou said.

"Suspicious Parcel Prompts Evacuation of Christmas Market in Potsdam, Germany","Photo

BERLIN — Officials evacuated a Christmas market in Potsdam on Friday evening after a suspicious package was found nearby, reviving fears that the country’s popular holiday tradition remained vulnerable despite increased security after a terror attack on a market in Berlin last year.

A small package with wires sticking out was delivered to a pharmacy across the street from the market on Friday afternoon, the local news media reported. Police X-rayed the box and said it contained a large cylinder in which nails were visible. Experts then destroyed the box in a controlled explosion, officials said.

No injuries were reported, and the top security official for the state of Brandenburg, Interior Minister Karl-Heinz Schröter, said authorities were still trying to determine whether the package could have detonated, and whether it was intended for the pharmacy or the market.

“The evaluation and analysis is just beginning now,” Mr. Schröter told reporters.

Authorities said that they had no indication of terrorism or any other motive, but parts of the market and the surrounding streets remained sealed off on Friday night as they continued their investigation.

The scare recalled memories of the Dec. 19 attack on a Christmas market in western Berlin, in which a Tunisian man hijacked a truck and drove it into the stands, killing 12 people and injuring dozens of others. The assailant, Anis Amri, was killed in a shootout with police in Italy four days later.

As a result of that attack, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility, the authorities increased security at Christmas markets this season. They are surrounded with concrete barriers, and more officers are patrolling among the stands, which sell handicrafts, sweets and small gifts.",REAL
Why Democracy Feels Like a Dangerous Game,"The result is that democracy now feels like a dangerous game. And even Ms. Merkel, arguably the Western leader who plays it best, has not figured out how to win.

Democracy … Except Some Votes Don’t Really Count

As the far right rises across Europe, mainstream parties, seeing an existential threat to liberal democracy, have searched for ways to contain its influence. The solution that major European powers like France and Germany have settled on — and that will be a component of any solution to Ms. Merkel’s current dilemma — is a so-called cordon sanitaire against the far right.

The term, which roughly translated means “quarantine” in French, means sealing off the far right from any power or influence, no matter how many votes it wins. Mainstream parties will not allow the far right into political coalitions or work with it on joint legislation. In Germany’s case, that means an absolute refusal to allow the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, into any governing coalition. The party recently won seats in Germany’s national legislature for the first time.

In the short term, such policies have effectively limited the influence of both longstanding far-right parties like the National Front in France and insurgent upstarts like the AfD. To the many politicians and citizens who fear what might happen if the far right were to exercise real power, that feels like an important victory.

But in the longer term, it turns out to have unintended side effects, making the underlying problems worse — with potentially serious consequences for democracy.

David Art, a professor at Tufts University who studies the European far right, said the mismatch between the votes the far right receives and the influence it wields was one of the “greatest untold stories” of far-right politics.

Policies devised to lock the far right out of power mean far-right voters “have gotten extremely little bang for their buck,” Professor Art said. “You have somewhere between 15 and 20 percent of the European electorate casting its votes for parties that are credibly shut out.”

And shutting a large populist party out of power for years has consequences for the political system itself, not just for that party and its voters.

As the far right’s share of the vote grows, that increases pressure on mainstream parties to cooperate with each other to present a united front and contain the threat. This can mean forming a grand coalition, in which the two largest parties join together despite their political differences.

The result, Professor Art said, is that mainstream politics can start to look like an elite cartel, in which establishment parties must maintain consensus to govern, and so are limited to an increasingly narrow lane of policy options regardless of what voters demand or issues require.

Making the Far Right’s Arguments For It

The problem with that goes beyond legislation. That kind of consensus politics can end up looking an awful lot like far-right populist parties’ claim that all mainstream parties are the same, controlled by elites who do not listen to the people.

At far-right rallies in Europe this year, many supporters told me they saw mainstream parties as all the same and out of touch, an elite establishment unwilling to listen to people’s political demands.

At a rally in Potsdam, Germany, for instance, a chemist who asked to be called Frau Doktor Huss, for fear of consequences if her views became known, declared that she was “totally against” the establishment, which she accused of silencing debate and trying to impose multiculturalism on an unwilling population.

And in Fréjus, France, a local official, Gilles Longo, said he felt “betrayed” by former President Nicolas Sarkozy’s cooperation with the left. “The people who want the National Front, it’s because they don’t believe in the other parties any longer,” he said.

Cordon sanitaire politics can, ironically, end up making these far-right critiques of the establishment more true, by ensuring that mainstream parties really do have to embrace similar positions to reach consensus, and by setting up the political system as the far right versus everyone else.

And supporters of mainstream parties may also grow discontented as they come to see the political system as more concerned with preserving elite consensus than representing voters.

Short-Term Solutions, Deepening Long-Term Problems

This type of political maneuvering, though an effective short-term solution to the political volatility of contemporary democracy, can end up making the underlying causes of that volatility worse.

In Germany, the two largest political parties, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, known as the C.D.U., and the center-left Social Democratic Party, the S.P.D., lost a total of 95 seats in the most recent election, a result that many party leaders attribute to a rejection of their grand coalition by voters.

But after Ms. Merkel’s effort to create a coalition with two smaller parties failed, the C.D.U. and S.P.D. are once again considering joining talks about a new coalition.

That sets up a stark choice: Either the mainstream parties will join together in a coalition that voters have already rejected, or the German president will have to call a new election, invalidating the previous vote entirely.

Either option seems likely to dent voters’ faith in the system. Democracy’s central tenet is that political legitimacy comes from voter support.

If people stop believing that their votes count, and parties come to see voters as untrustworthy decision makers, then that sets up a far deeper danger — that voters and institutions will become not just unreliable, but not fully invested in the democratic system.

That would render those fundamental building blocks of democracy, and thus democracy itself, even more unstable. And as volatility increases, short-term solutions to restore stability could ultimately undermine it.",REAL
"Ravaged by Cholera, Yemen Faces 2nd Preventable Scourge: Diphtheria","The blockade quickly worsened what was already one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, denying deliveries of urgently needed food, fuel and medicine to Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East.

The top relief official of the United Nations, Mark Lowcock, said on Nov. 8 that at least seven million Yemenis could starve because of the Saudi blockade and that unless it were completely rescinded, the country would suffer “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades.”

Under intense international pressure, the Saudis partly eased the blockade this week. But United Nations officials said Friday that emergency aid deliveries still faced big problems, with many ships unable to unload.

“We’ve seen some progress in the right direction, but obviously we’re not at the level of unimpeded access we’d like to see,” Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the United Nations in New York, told reporters.

Earlier Friday in Geneva, Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said that 1.9 million doses of diphtheria vaccine for children under age 5, and 1,000 doses of diphtheria antitoxins needed to treat infected patients had arrived in Sana, the capital, in recent days.

Nonetheless, he said, “the recent border closings still have seriously impacted W.H.O.’s operations and our ability to restock,” and the organization still lacks even “one dose of diphtheria vaccine for children above 5.”

Yemen’s diphtheria outbreak comes as the country is still struggling with the world’s worst epidemic of cholera, which can cause potentially fatal dehydration if untreated. Nearly one million Yemenis have been infected by cholera this year and more than 2,200 have died, according to the latest World Health Organization data.

Both diphtheria and cholera can thrive in regions suffering from poverty and war. But diphtheria, which once was a leading cause of child deaths in the world, was thought to have been largely vanquished through systematic vaccinations.

Symptoms include sore throat, loss of appetite, fever and difficulty breathing and swallowing.

More than 15,000 people in the United States died during a diphtheria outbreak in the 1920s, but infection rates then plummeted with the introduction of a vaccine.

Russia suffered a major diphtheria outbreak in the early 1990s, which public-health experts attributed to failings in its immunization system and the mass movement of people after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Marc Poncin, the emergency coordinator in Yemen for Doctors Without Borders, said in an email on Friday that Yemen’s health care system, which has now collapsed, could have once easily prevented and contained the diphtheria outbreak.

“With the last diphtheria case in Yemen recorded in 1992, and the last outbreak in 1982,” Mr. Poncin said, “the ongoing war is sending the Yemen health system decades back in time.”",REAL
Philippines Suspends Dengue Shots After Drug Firm’s Warning,"Mr. Duque said that, with an average of 200,000 people infected with dengue every year in the Philippines, vaccination was “essential.”

He said that the Department of Health would be stepping up its monitoring efforts to ensure public safety and that the department’s legal division was studying what to do with the Sanofi contract and how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of children who may have been put at risk.

Mr. Duque said that government officials had been asked to coordinate with community health experts to identify and monitor the children. He said a post-vaccination surveillance program would last for five years.

“I hope that this development will not in any way affect the expanded program of immunization because there are countless number of lives that have been saved,” Mr. Duque said, adding that 7 billion Philippine pesos, or about $140 million, had been budgeted for all government vaccination programs for the year, up from 340 million pesos in 2006.

He would not say when the program was likely to be restarted or what steps would be necessary to allow resumption.

“We need to go back quite a long way to really put the facts together,” Mr. Duque said. “Until that is available, we can’t answer all your questions with definitive responses.”

He said the vaccines that were now in stock would not be allowed to be sold unless the labels were changed to reflect the latest advisory.

Sanofi representatives in Manila were not immediately available to comment on Friday.

The Philippines became the first country in Asia to approve the commercial sale of Dengvaxia, in December 2015. Dengvaxia is the first dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi.

Health advocates in the Philippines first raised the alarm over Dengvaxia when the government announced in April last year that it would be used in the school immunization program despite the fact that it was a relatively new drug with possible unknown effects. But the government continued, budgeting about $70 million for the program.

The government has defended its use of the vaccine, saying that the treatment had undergone extensive studies and stressing that it was approved for use by the World Health Organization. The first hint that there could be something wrong was in April last year, when an 11-year-old boy with congenital heart disease died after receiving a Dengvaxia shot, but the government worked to distance the drug from the death.

Nancy Binay, a legislator in the Philippine Senate, said she was alarmed at the drug’s potential impact on public health and urged the health authorities and Sanofi to “launch a nationwide medical advisory and information drive” to contact parents whose children had been given Dengvaxia.

The recently released Sanofi medical report was “deeply shocking and disturbing,” Senator Binay said.

She said it was “sad” that the health department ignored the warnings about the lack of patient safety and research integrity in the Dengvaxia tests. “Safety should always be the paramount concern when it comes to any immunization program,” she said.

Senator Binay called on the pharmaceutical giant to explain what it meant when it warned of “severe disease.”

“We don’t want the warning to the public to come too little, too late,” she said. “Obviously, there were shortfalls and gaps in the vaccine’s safety profile, and I believe Sanofi is morally and ethically obliged to inform the public what severe diseases came out in their clinical tests.”

Dr. Anthony Leachon, an independent director at PhilHealth, a government medical insurance body, said the Philippine medical community had expressed alarm at the government’s use of the vaccine.

He said that as early as last year medical experts had told the government that there was “lingering uncertainty” about the long-term effects of the vaccine, but that their concerns had apparently been ignored.

“Evidence from manufacturer’s trials shows that there may be a paradoxical increase in the incidence of severe dengue beginning a few years after children are vaccinated, and possibly continuing for the rest of their lives,” Dr. Leachon said.

The clinical trials on the dengue vaccine were designed specifically to assess this “and sadly, this danger has been confirmed,” he said.

“Many parents, teachers and health care workers claim they were never fully informed about the benefits and potential side effects of the vaccine,” Dr. Leachon added.",REAL
Georgia Says It Killed Suspect in 2016 Bombing at Istanbul Airport,"TBILISI - A former Islamic State fighter suspected of masterminding a deadly attack on Istanbul airport in 2016 was killed during a special operation in ex-Soviet Georgia last week, a spokeswoman for Georgia’s state security service said on Friday.

Akhmed Chatayev was named by Turkish media and a U.S. congressman as the mastermind of the suicide bombing of Istanbul airport in 2016 which killed 45 people. His involvement has not been corroborated by Turkish officials.

""It’s confirmed that one of those killed during the operation is Akhmed Chatayev,” Nino Giorgobiani, a spokeswoman for Georgia’s state security service, told a news briefing.

Giorgobiani said that Chatayev blew himself up.

One Georgian special forces serviceman and two other members of the armed group, which was suspected of terrorism, were killed in the same operation. Four police officers were wounded and one member of the group was also arrested.

Bali Volcano Evacuees Sneak Back into Danger Zone,"Mount Agung is so large that an eruption would affect not only the island’s residents but the entire world, according to climate scientists: A massive expulsion of smoke and ash could cool the planet and help slow global warming by releasing large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. Such particles could reflect sunlight away from the earth for a year or more, as occurred with the eruptions of Mount Agung in 1963 and of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, 1,650 miles north, in 1991.

Bali is often called a tourist island because of its many resorts and attractions, but it is home to more than 4 million people, most of them Hindus, like Mr. Negara.

The 1963 eruption of Mount Agung killed more than 1,000 people. This time, the government has ordered that residents evacuate every village within six miles of the mountain’s summit. About 100,000 people are believed to live in the danger zone.

More than 55,000 people have moved into evacuation camps. Others may have gone to stay with relatives without registering with officials. Many have had to abandon jobs, gardens and livestock.

Despite the scale of the evacuation, its implementation has been haphazard. Some roads leading into the area have no checkpoints — or police officers on duty — to stop people from passing through.

Many residents go home regularly to feed their animals and check on their homes before returning to the camps at night.

Within the evacuation zone, gray ash covers bushes, walls and buildings. The scent of sulfur is heavy in the air. Schools are empty and dogs roam the streets. Occasionally, a motorcycle rider wearing a face mask drives by.

Kadek Sariyani, 41, had reopened her warung, a small shop where she sells drinks and food to residents who venture back to their homes during the day. Before Mount Agung began rumbling, she could earn more than $20 a day. Now, she makes about $7.

“I know this area is prone to disaster and according to the government we are not supposed to be here,” she said. “But I need to feed my pigs and chickens. I cannot leave them starving.”

Wayan Sukarya, 46, a resident of Bhuana Giri who stopped by the shop, said he had been unable to find work as a day laborer since he was evacuated in September. He also returns to the village every day.

“My animals are my assets, that’s why I have to take really good care of them,” he said. “It is like I live here in the daytime, and go back to the camp when it is dark.”

Lt. Col. Benny Rahadian, the commander of the Mount Agung disaster relief task force, acknowledged the evacuation was incomplete. But, he said, he sympathized with residents who had nothing but their homes and small farms.

“We can’t say they could not go back to their village,” he said. “We will warn them, persuade them.”

Many residents fled their homes in September when the ground began shaking and officials said that a major eruption was imminent. After six weeks, the danger seemed to have passed and many returned home.

On Monday, officials sounded the alarm again when the volcano erupted, belching huge volumes of steam and ash.

Ngurah Rai International Airport was forced to close for three days because of the ash cloud, stranding thousands of tourists.

But since then, Mount Agung has settled down. The airport has reopened and residents are waiting to learn when they can safely return home.

Nengah Wadi, 38, has been camping out with eight family members at the Pasar Seni camp in Manggis.

“It is a very difficult situation for everybody,” she said. “But at the same time, we are thankful that we have a roof to cover our heads and have food three times daily.”

The family spent more than five weeks in a camp in September when it first appeared Mount Agung would erupt.

This week, they evacuated immediately when the air filled with ash and sulfur and they feared that mud and volcanic debris would begin flowing down the mountain.

“It feels like being in a prison,” she said. “You can go anywhere you want actually. But at the same time you keep worrying about your house, your animals, and not knowing when you can return to your own home.”",REAL
Sending Out an SOS: The Rise of Travel Security Apps,"The Getaway Sending Out an SOS: The Rise of Travel Security Apps Safety apps aim to offer assurance on the road. Image Credit Wesley Bedrosian

From transferring money to buying airline tickets, smartphone apps can be a traveler’s high-tech multitasker. But can they keep travelers safe? A new crop of apps seeks to offer that assurance.

They may be cashing in on a sense of insecurity wrought by more frequent terrorist events, including the truck attack in Lower Manhattan in October, and recent natural disasters like hurricanes.

“There are more risks now than in the past, but that doesn’t make travel more dangerous,” said Matthew Bradley, the regional director of security for International SOS, a medical and travel security risk services company. He cited the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris as ushering in the risk of terrorism to Europe that was once seen as unlikely .

Still, car accidents and petty crimes such as pickpocketing are much more common travel threats than terrorism or kidnapping. To mitigate these risks, experts advise hiring drivers in foreign countries, carrying little cash and dressing inconspicuously to avoid attracting attention.

“Americans have a lot of tells,” said Bruce A. Alexander, a terrorism expert and the former Iraq program manager in the antiterrorism office at the State Department. “Leave the San Diego State sweatshirt at home.”

Supplementing these practices, security apps deliver incident updates in the location where a user is traveling. Notifications range from supplying country profiles before departure to alerts about disease outbreaks. Many also contain a panic button to summon assistance in an emergency.

While few of these security apps replace travel insurance, which covers the cost of a medical emergency or evacuation, many do provide a range of services designed to keep travelers safe.

Tracking users and triggering cost-free evacuations

A new app from the London-based security firm Drum Cussac, CloseCircle, which is scheduled to be available this month (December), is designed to act as a security monitor and emergency evacuation service. The app digitally transmits your location to staff at headquarters (the firm says it just uses three percent of your phone’s battery power over 24 hours). When an emergency such as a terrorist attack or a hurricane occurs where you are traveling, company employees will call, check in and advise users on avoiding risk and getting out of harm’s way. When under threat, users can also engage an SOS button that summons a response from its agents.

Unlike other security apps, CloseCircle membership guarantees a cost-free evacuation in the event of life-threatening danger. The service is backed by an insurance policy that covers the expenses.

“CloseCircle is aiming to be pre-emptive wherever possible and to actually warn members away from dangers that they may not even yet be aware of,” Simon Philips, the chairman of Drum Cussac, wrote in an email.

Terms: Annual memberships cost £195 a person, or about $260; £349 a couple; and £595 for a family of up to six people; closecircle.com.

Tracking users on demand

Developed by Incident Management Group, a firm that specializes in the security of business travelers and individuals, FoneTrac allows users to check in at the press of a button to let the firm and anyone on their designated contact list know that they are fine. The company also monitors security developments worldwide and will send a message to app users if anything from a terrorist attack to an earthquake is going on where they are. In the event of an emergency, a panic button provides the firm your location and triggers g round support .

The app does not track a user’s physical location continuously, except in the event of a panic alert when it runs continuously, but inconspicuously, until it is physically turned off.

Terms: $15 a month for a minimum of three months; fonetrac-go.com.

Focusing on health and safety

Established in 2012 and available on a mobile app since 2013, Sitata sends out “Trip Alerts” that cover any potentially travel-disrupting event, other than the usual flight delays. These could be disease outbreaks, violent protests, extreme weather or transit strikes. The coverage is global and the firm uses artificial intelligence to monitor the media, traditional and social, to track events worldwide.

Founded by Ron St. John, the former director of emergency preparedness for Canada, and his son Adam St. John, the app was initially developed to disseminate public health information and expanded to more broadly address security. It remains strong in tracking disease outbreaks; the app will even inform users after they have returned from a trip if a disease such as dengue fever has broken out where they were traveling and if there was an incubation period.

“This is important because you may come home and start to feel sick and go to your doctor and forget to say you were in Brazil, which could lead to misdiagnosis,” said Adam St. John, the chief executive officer of Sitata.

Terms: Free for now, though the company plans to change in 2018 to a modestly priced subscription service; sitata.com.

Emergency alerts in New York and San Francisco

Currently available only in New York and San Francisco, the new app Citizen alerts users to some events that have triggered a 911 call to local authorities. This could be any emergency related to public safety such as a bank robbery, fire or terrorist attack.

If the event takes place within a quarter mile of your location, and the app is running, you will receive a push notification with the alert. Users are also able to discuss the incidents among themselves via the app, which displays a map showing where incidents are occurring.

Originally launched as Vigilante, the company quickly rebranded after it became aware the name appeared to incite citizen action. “The name didn’t match our goal which is to keep people safe and not to encourage them to intervene and disrupt police officers,” said Lea Artz, a spokeswoman for Citizen.

Terms: Free; citizen.com.

A smartwatch panic button

ADT, the home security company, has announced its intention to follow its customers beyond their homes with its first app, ADT Panic Response, available only on Samsung Gear S2 and Gear S3 smartwatches.

Watch wearers can engage the app in an emergency, which transmits a GPS location and connects to an ADT agent to dispatch help. The service is only available in the United States.

“We like wearables because someone who might go out running tends not to take a smartphone with them because it’s bulky and heavy,” said Jay Darfler, the senior vice president of emerging markets at ADT. In the running example, he added, the user had turned his ankle in the woods, was unable to walk and summoned help via the watch app. The company plans to launch a related smartphone app next year.

Terms: $10 a month; adtcanopy.com.

"Holiday Windows, a (Sort of) Love Story","In one tableau a figure is a “nose” smelling a rose, in order to make perfume. In another, the two designers are employees in a beauty salon, holding hair dryer and manicure tools aloft. Here they are cobblers; there they are hand-painting floral designs onto purses.

What does it all mean? Is it Christmassy? Is it fabulous? Does it denote a midlife crisis? Who can say.

Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;

With jellies soother than the creamy curd,

And lucent syrups, tinct with cinnamon …”

Then, with a seasonal nod to order and plenty, I’d recreate the Christmas dinner in “The Dead” by James Joyce. I’d set a goose at one end of a table and at the other end a great ham, with “a neat paper frill round its shin.” Symmetrical side dishes and celery vases would be stationed at intervals with cut glass decanters standing sentry to the fruit stand. I’d like this framed by Joyce’s snowflakes, silver and dark, falling against the windowpane, after the late-night confession of lost love.

Finally I’d bottle and spritz (or simply screen) the moment before Judy Garland’s character Esther Smith sings “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” in “Meet Me in St Louis,” when she makes a strange emotional gesture, in the direction of her little sister — a half kiss crossed with a sudden expression of sympathy. It is as if, in that movement, she thinks better of saying something not quite right to her small relation, deciding to swallow her fears about the future, leaving the scene shimmering with the notion that no matter what your age, you are never quite as light and carefree as you wish to be at Christmas. That life (and Christmas) are serious things.

Pakistani Taliban Dressed in Burqas Kill Students at Dormitory,"Photo

PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Four or more Taliban militants disguised as women attacked a university dormitory in the northern Pakistani city of Peshawar on Friday, killing at least nine people and wounding at least 30 others, officials said.

Local news outlets, however, gave a higher death count and reported that 11 people were killed in the early morning attack on a boarding facility at the Agriculture Training Institute, located within the sprawling compound of University of Peshawar.

The militants wore burqas, women’s garments that fully cover the body and head, when they arrived at the gate of the institute in a rickshaw. They shot and wounded a security guard and then moved toward the dormitory, according to Islam Zeb, the deputy commissioner of Peshawar.

Mr. Zeb said two militants took positions on the ground floor and another two took hold one floor above as they carried out the attack. After a two-hour firefight, the security forces said, all the attackers had been killed.

The attack was claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, which used to wage frequent, large-scale attacks in Peshawar and other cities but has been weakened in recent years.

Revered Australian TV Figure Feels Ripples of Weinstein Scandal,"“I think for many women, they’ve actually spoken up in the past — but they haven’t spoken to an environment that’s prepared to listen,” she added.

Mr. Burke has been accused of groping his former female colleagues’ breasts, asking a woman to audition topless for a family-oriented show, and trying to remove a television researcher’s clothing and inappropriately touching her while on a work trip, among other transgressions.

“I am deeply hurt and outraged at the false and defamatory claims made,” Mr. Burke said in a statement about the accounts of his behavior, first reported Monday by ABC-Fairfax.

People in the media industry say the allegations against Mr. Burke reflect a type of behavior that has always been rife and well known — but not considered news until now.

“When we see these issues in the U.S., when you know powerful people come out and say no, that has a contagion effect,” Ms. Broderick said. “What’s shifting now is there’s a much greater preparedness for people to listen.”

Other experts, like Catharine Lumby, a professor at Macquarie University in Sydney who has specialized in gender studies, say that the “dams have broken” by what people here are calling the Weinstein effect — and that it is rippling across the world.

In Europe, the French have been among the most vocal in calling out once-ignored abusers. In Britain, allegations of sexual misconduct have convulsed Parliament.

Here in Australia, the focus on Mr. Burke has reinvigorated debate about a power gap between men and women in the Australian news media, and provoked a candid discussion about what some describe as this country’s culture of masculinity — a subject that some say has been ignored for too long.

“The role of the ‘bloke’ in our society is one that’s been venerated,” said Tracey Spicer, an author who has been writing and talking about sexual harassment and assault in the Australian media for more than a decade.

“And this boys’ club or locker room mentality extends to the boardrooms,” she added. “They simply don’t take sexual harassment seriously.”

Weeks after The New York Times and The New Yorker first published articles about accusations against Mr. Weinstein, the “Me Too” campaign exploded on social media here as a vehicle for women to share their stories.

Through a simple tweet telling the world she was investigating two long-term offenders, Ms. Spicer invited women to share their stories privately. Hundreds subsequently contacted her, revealing a tsunami of injustice, she said.

The accusations against Mr. Burke are likely to produce more accounts of abuses in the media and entertainment industries, experts say.

This week the academy award-winning actor Geoffrey Rush, who is from Australia, was accused publicly of “inappropriate behavior” during his work with the Sydney Theater Company. Mr. Rush vigorously denied the allegations, and his lawyer said that his name had been smeared and reputation damaged.

But the media industry is particularly delicate terrain, Ms. Spicer said.

“A lot of men in the media don’t want the story told, because they feel they’ve been complicit, either as offenders or enablers,” she said. “And women fear they’ll never work again in this very small industry if they speak out.”

That and women’s relative lack of power in the industry help explain Australia’s lag in debating whether its media serve to protect harassers, Ms. Spicer said.

While women make up more than half the employees in the industry, they typically occupy the lower paid, less powerful roles, she said, a situation entrenched further by Australia’s historical culture of toxic masculinity.

A national survey by the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2012 found that one in four women had been sexually harassed at work in the preceding five years, said Kate Jenkins, Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, adding that the figure was little changed over previous surveys.

But a sign of Australia’s greater willingness to address the issue, experts say, is the group Male Champions of Change, formed in 2010 with a handful of leaders and now encompassing more than 100 of Australia’s most influential men working to redefine men’s roles by tackling gender inequality.

“The other part of the Weinstein effect is that we have to continue to work with men — and particularly powerful men — to make sure that when women speak the system listens,” said Ms. Broderick, the former sex discrimination commissioner who is also the founder of Male Champions of Change. “Because it is men that represent the system.”",REAL
Trump’s First Major Trade Fight With China Could Be Over Solar Panels,"But American manufacturers say the cheap panels have been unfairly financed by the Chinese government. Chinese manufacturers have benefited from cheap loans from government-run banks. Even some Chinese companies that have struggled with losses and had trouble making loan payments have been able to stay afloat.

Such manufacturers in China “are technically insolvent, but they still get capital,” said Mark Widmar, the chief executive of First Solar, a large manufacturer based in Phoenix.

The United States has already imposed tariffs on solar panels from China over the past five years, prompting Chinese manufacturers to build vast factories in Southeast Asia. Now, the Trump administration has indicated it may raise the stakes by authorizing tariffs on all solar panel imports, including those from Southeast Asia.

Administration officials have so far allowed two solar panel companies with factories in the United States to ask Washington for tariffs on all solar panel imports.

Thanks to a complicated series of maneuvers within the United States system for evaluating trade cases, the Trump administration now has a Jan. 26 deadline to grant the companies’ requests for wider tariffs.

China opposes the move, which it argues would hurt solar panel buyers. When the Chinese-owned factories in Southeast Asia are included, Chinese panel makers account for about four-fifths of global sales.

Solar panel installers, developers of utility-scale solar panel power generation projects and others connected to the industry also oppose broader tariffs. The Solar Energy Industries Association, which represents those groups, contends that the tariffs would destroy more installation jobs than they would protect or create among manufacturers.

“If my price goes up, I’m not going to win” orders, Abigail Ross Hopper, the chief executive and president of the Washington-based association, said in a telephone interview.

Yet the effects of tariffs are disputed within the industry. Solar panel makers in the United States say higher tariffs would add only modestly to the cost of projects.

“That’s still very compelling for any utility,” said Mr. Widmar, of First Solar.

Many trade experts predict the United States will impose tariffs on all solar panel imports, because Mr. Trump has expressed sympathy for industrial workers in the United States and for fossil fuels, while voicing skepticism about the use of renewable energy.

If the Trump administration decides to impose more tariffs next month, it could be the first blow in a one-two punch to China on trade, making it even more likely that Beijing might retaliate against American exports. The deadline for the administration to act on possibly imposing tariffs on washing machines from around the world, and particularly from China, comes a little more than a week later, on Feb. 3.

Mr. Li, the Chinese economic adviser, contended that China, not the United States, was the country that had proved willing to let market forces determine winners and losers in the solar panel market. China had 800 solar panel companies a decade ago and now has just 70 or 80, after allowing the rest to become insolvent. Yet China’s solar panel production has more than quintupled in the past decade because, he said, Beijing has allowed market forces to winnow the industry to the most efficient competitors.

By contrast, political support in the United States for solar panel manufacturing wilted after a single solar equipment company in California, Solyndra, collapsed in 2011 after obtaining $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees.

“You are a little bit worried by Solyndra; very small companies, why are you worried about them?” Mr. Li said. “Then you hurt all the users.”",REAL
"Akihito, Emperor of Japan, Says He Will Abdicate in 2019","Photo

HONG KONG — The emperor of Japan will step down on April 30, 2019, the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in two centuries, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday.

Emperor Akihito, 83, said last year that he planned to step down before his death, and Friday’s announcement set the date.

Emperors were godlike figures in Japan before the end of World War II. When Emperor Hirohito announced Japan’s surrender over the radio on August 15, 1945, it was the first time average citizens had heard his voice.

The American victors stripped the Chrysanthemum Throne of all political power. Emperor Akihito, Hirohito’s eldest son, has a strictly ceremonial role but is a respected and popular figure in Japan.

Japan’s Parliament passed a law in June that allows the emperor to retire, and proposed considering allowing the position to be passed to a female descendant.

Emperor Akihito’s retirement would allow his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito, 57, to succeed him.",REAL
