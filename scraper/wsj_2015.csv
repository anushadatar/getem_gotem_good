Spice Maker Names

New Chief Executive

Spice maker McCormick & Co. said Tuesday that Lawrence Kurzius would succeed Chief Executive Alan Wilson, who will continue as executive chairman of the board.

The moves are effective Feb. 1.

Mr. Kurzius, 57 years old, who was elected to the board Nov. 24, was previously president and chief operating officer. In the new position, he will receive an annual base salary of $900,000, according to company filings. Since January, he has taken over global operations from Mr. Wilson, 58.

Lead board director Michael Mangan said Mr. Wilson helped drive the company’s financial success. Sales grew more than $1 billion to $4.2 billion and market capitalization doubled during his eight-year tenure, Mr. Mangan said.

Mr. Kurzius, who has been in leadership positions with McCormick since 2007, was previously CEO of Zatarain’s, which was purchased by McCormick. He also worked with Uncle Ben’s, a division of Mars Inc. and the Quaker Oats Co.

MarkWest, Marathon Say Deal Is Approved

Energy companies MarkWest Energy Partners LP and Marathon Petroleum Corp. said Tuesday that their merger deal, which faced opposition from a MarkWest founder, had been approved by that company’s shareholders.

The deal was expected to be completed by Dec. 4.

The agreement will make MarkWest, the second-largest natural gas processor in the U.S., a subsidiary of MPLX, Marathon’s pipeline operator, and creates among the biggest master limited partnerships.

Last month, Marathon submitted what it called its “best and final offer,” increasing the cash portion of the deal to compensate for a falling MPLX share price. The new offer was for $6.20 per unit of cash for MarkWest shareholders, plus 1.09 MPLX units for each MarkWest unit.

Earlier last month, a former CEO of MarkWest, John Fox, among the founders of the company in 1988, sought to scuttle the marriage, saying shareholders would be better served with a stand-alone company.

Mr. Fox delivered a letter outlining his concerns to MarkWest’s board and Chief Executive Frank Semple, and said he planned to mount a campaign to sway other shareholders. Marathon beefed up its offer following Mr. Fox’s complaints.

Analysts said, however, that the same forces that have pummeled shares of Marathon’s partnership—the extended swoon of oil prices—also made it harder for MarkWest to remain alone or find a better buyer.

AIR PRODUCTS & CHEMICALS

CEO Says Company Won’t Pursue Airgas

Air Products & Chemicals Inc. said Tuesday that it won’t seek to break up Airgas Inc.’s $10.3 billion pact to sell itself to France’s Air Liquide SA .

Air Products Chief Executive Seifi Ghasemi said at a conference that the company “will not pursue a bid to acquire Airgas.” Mr. Ghasemi also backed the company’s guidance for $7.25 to $7.50 a share in earnings for 2016 on a continuing-operations basis.

Air Products had chased Airgas for most of 2010 before being ultimately rebuffed after a Delaware court upheld Airgas’s so-called poison-pill shareholder rights plan. At the time, Airgas said it was holding out for a price of at least $78 per share.

In November, Airgas agreed to sell itself to Air Liquide SA in a deal valued at $143 a share.

Air Products shares were up 0.9% in midday trading, while Airgas shares ticked up 0.2%.

CANADIAN OIL SANDS

Capital Spending

To Shrink Next Year

Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. on Tuesday said capital spending will total about 295 million Canadian dollars ($221 million) next year, down sharply from recent years and reflecting its efforts to adjust to the low oil-price environment.

The Calgary, Alberta-based company’s budget estimate comes as it attempts to fight off a hostile C$4.47 billion takeover bid from larger rival Suncor Energy Inc., which like Canadian Oil Sands is a partner in the Syncrude oil-sands mining project in northern Alberta.

In outlining its 2016 budget, Canadian Oil Sands emphasized its efforts to reduce costs to help weather lower oil prices. It said it expects to generate cash flow of about C$633 million in 2016, enough to fund its current dividend and its share of capital spending at Syncrude.

Canadian Oil Sands’ planned 2016 spending contrasts with its initial capital budgets for 2015 and 2014 of C$564 million and C$1.1 billion, respectively. Like other oil-sands operators, the company has sharply reduced costs in response to low oil prices. It slashed its quarterly dividend to 5 Canadian cents a share from 35 Canadian cents early this year.

Canadian Oil Sands said its budget assumes Syncrude will produce 105 million barrels of crude in 2016, with the company’s share being 38.6 million barrels based on its 36.74% stake in the project. That would be up about 10% from estimated 2015 output.

The 2016 capital budget assumes a West Texas Intermediate crude price of about $50 a barrel. But the company said that, even assuming a WTI price of $45 a barrel, it can fully fund all costs, including capital expenditures and the current dividend.

Canadian Oil Sands has rejected Suncor’s bid as too low. On Monday, the securities regulator in the companies’ home province of Alberta upheld a “poison pill” plan adopted by Canadian Oil Sands in response to the bid, ruling its shareholders have until Jan. 4 to make a decision on Suncor’s offer. Suncor has set a Dec. 4 deadline for the bid.

Crude Prices Fall; Larger U.S. Stockpiles Expected,"Crude oil future prices inched lower in early Asia trade Wednesday as traders squared their positions on fears U.S. stockpiles likely rose higher than expected, adding to an expanding global surplus.

According to the industry group American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. crude inventories likely rose 1.6 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 27. The estimate is bigger than the 1.2 million barrel draw surveyed by the pricing agency Platts.

Official data will be released later Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration. Last week, the U.S. government said at 488.2 million barrels, the country’s inventories were at levels unseen at this time of the year in at least eight decades.

Traders will be also eyeing the refinery utilization rate and production figures to gauge future supplies.

“Directionally, the decline in production since April looks constructive, but it has been more gradual than bulls had been hoping for and insufficient to rebalance the global market or even deplete U.S. inventories,” says Tim Evans, a Citi Futures analyst.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in January traded at $41.63 a barrel at 0216 GMT, down $0.22 in the Globex electronic session. January Brent crude on London’s ICE Futures exchange fell $0.14 to $44.30 a barrel.

A global glut has been weighing on the industry for over a year and the problem is likely to continue as major producers, both inside and outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, aren’t showing signs of cutting output. Traders will be watching the OPEC meeting this Friday for any moves by the cartel.

Prices for Nymex and Brent are around 40% lower from same time last year and have stayed in the below-$50 range for months.

“Trading remains thin as whatever decision is reached at the OPEC meeting this Friday will have a dramatic effect on prices,” said Stuart Ive, a client manager at OM Financial.

He said if the OPEC opts to keep the “no-cut” policy, it will indicate Iran, which will likely boost exports in coming months after the sanctions are lifted, will add at least 500,000 barrels per day to the global pool. However, if the Saudi Arabia-led cartel decides to trim oil production quotas, prices will rally even with the current glut.

Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock for January--the benchmark gasoline contract--fell 80 points to $1.3550 a gallon, while January diesel traded at $1.3603, 87 points lower.

ICE gasoil for December changed hands at $401.25 a metric ton, down $1.50 from Tuesday’s settlement.

Why Japan’s Mega Banks are Mega Cheap,"Pedestrians walk past a signboard of Japan's mega banks. Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho Financial unveiled recently concrete plans to sell off some of their equity holdings. Photo: Reuters

Japan’s top banks are about to start unloading their massive holdings in other companies. This could be the key to improving their ultralow valuations.

Japan’s new corporate-governance code, pushed by the government, discourages the kind of cross-shareholdings that have long been a defining feature of corporate Japan. This is especially significant for the nation’s lenders, which hold equity stakes in many of their top customers. For instance, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial MTU -1.26% and Sumitomo Mitsui each has significant stakes in Toyota Motor .

Regulators hope that reducing these holdings will pave the way for a more rational allocation of lending, and eliminate conflicts of interest that arise when a bank is both a shareholder and creditor of a company.

For the banks, it also means the unwinding of a risk that has hung over their share prices. Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho Financial MFG -0.55% all have equity holdings equivalent to 40% to 50% of their tier 1 capital, of which a great deal is unrealized valuation gains. This means that any decline in share prices could put pressure on their capital levels.

In November, the three so-called mega banks unveiled for the first time concrete plans to sell off some these holdings. They each plan to sell 25% to 30% of their holdings, roughly over the next three to five years, and more afterward. Goldman Sachs analyst Katsunori Tanaka says these targets should be viewed as minimums, and actual sell-downs could happen even faster.

This will replace low-quality capital with hard cash, and boost capital ratios by lowering risk-weighted assets. Excluding unrealized gains on securities, the three have an average common-equity tier 1 capital ratio of 8.7%. If they were to sell just a quarter of their equity holdings, this would rise to 9.4%, according to a report by Mr. Tanaka.

Better capital levels could in turn pave the way for more cash returns to shareholders, especially for Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui, which have stronger balance sheets.

The three banks trade at between 0.7 and 0.8 times book value, in line with their averages over the past few years. Now that they are finally starting to unwind their shareholdings, the discount to book value is likely to fade. As Japan’s mega banks sell, it is time for investors to buy.

ISIS Sympathizers in U.S. Prefer Twitter Among Social Media,"Twitter Inc. noted on Monday that its terms of service say that it will “take action” on accounts that threaten or promote violence. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News

Islamic State is renowned for its ability to mobilize followers via social media like Twitter , but the group is also attracting clusters of American followers who meet in person and push one another toward violence, experts and law-enforcement officials say.

A study published Tuesday by George Washington University’s Program on Extremism examined cases involving Americans charged with terrorism for their suspected support of Islamic State and found their conversion to the group’s world view often involved a significant amount of direct contact with “pre-existing social contacts who already embraced jihadist ideology.”

A new report from George Washington University's Program on Extremism sheds light on the radicalization of American ISIS supporters. WSJ's Shelby Holliday highlights three key findings.

Concerns over threats from small groups of terrorist sympathizers have taken on a new urgency following last month’s attacks in Paris, which were carried out by people whose friendships and family connections appear to have formed the backbone of one or more terrorist cells.

Since the attacks, which killed over 100 people, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has upped its surveillance of known Islamic State supporters. U.S. counterterrorism officials say they haven’t uncovered any terror network or trained operatives in the U.S. like those who operated in Paris. Nor have they seen an uptick in the threat from people who might be inspired by the Paris bloodshed to launch copycat attacks, though they caution it is too early to measure that accurately.

About 70 people have been arrested in the U.S. on charges tied to Islamic State since early 2014, with investigations continuing in all 50 states, according to law-enforcement officials. Fifty-six people were arrested in 2015 alone, the largest number of terror arrests in a year since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the report said.

Tracking such suspects is a labor-intensive effort that has stretched thin the agencies charged with preventing attacks. The case load was so heavy in the spring and summer that the FBI had to pull agents off of criminal work to assist in terror cases. Director James Comey has called that unsustainable over the long term.

But since July, the pace of new prosecutions has slowed, and the number of Americans trying to travel to Syria has dropped from about two a week to about two a month, according to officials.

The group that calls itself Islamic State goes by many other names including ISIS, ISIL, and Daesh, each carrying a different definition and connotation. Photo:AP

Nineteen people have pleaded guilty, including seven who have already been sentenced to prison time, according to the Center on National Security at Fordham University’s School of Law, which also tracks ISIS cases. The rest are working their way through the courts.

The researchers at George Washington University said they have identified approximately 300 American supporters of the terrorist group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, on Twitter, the social-media platform of choice for many of the group’s supporters. The report also identifies two unnamed clusters of Islamic State-supporting friends, and the investigations are ongoing.

“ISIS is really good at motivating that single person to go out and do something, but...not many people act out in a way that’s truly alone. What we see more often are small cells,” said J.M. Berger, a counterterrorism expert and a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution, a think tank.

One cluster of friends in Texas “revolves around a few charismatic individuals and an Islamic studies group,’’ the report said. “Another, based in the suburbs of a large Midwestern city, appears to be composed of former high-school friends and a handful of their acquaintances.’’ The researchers didn’t further identify the groups as they said they didn’t want to interfere with potential criminal investigations.

Some clusters of alleged Islamic State supporters in the U.S. have been exposed by investigations. Federal prosecutors this summer brought a series of cases against five friends living in New York and New Jersey who allegedly pledged allegiance to Islamic State and were plotting to travel overseas to fight for the group.

Communications on social media began as early as 2012 between defendants Nader Saadeh, of Rutherford, N.J., and Munther Omar Saleh, of Queens, N.Y. As their discussions developed into the following year, they talked about their desire to build a “small army” of friends to fight against America, according to the indictments.

The group incorporated more people and began meeting together to watch Islamic State beheading videos and discuss plans to go overseas, prosecutors said. Some defendants were meeting on almost a daily basis between May and June, during which Mr. Saadeh flew from John F. Kennedy Airport to Amman, Jordan, with the intention of joining Islamic State, the indictments alleged.

Two defendants in this case have pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges, and Nader Saadeh is in plea negotiations, court papers say. Cases against the remaining two defendants, including Mr. Saleh, who have pleaded not guilty, are pending. Deborah Colson, the lawyer for Mr. Saleh, said: “We ask that the public withhold judgment until all of the facts are revealed.” Lawyers for the other defendants didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Defendants linked to Islamic State have posed unprecedented law-enforcement challenges. They are, on average, 26 years old, but have been as young as 15, younger than terrorism suspects charged in the U.S. in the past, the report says. Most of them are male, but the report says women, who make up almost 15% of the arrests, “are taking an increasingly prominent role.” Converts to Islam are overrepresented, comprising 40% of those arrested. The majority of suspects charged are U.S. citizens or legal residents, “underscoring the homegrown nature of the threat,” the report said, which said some clusters are organized around ethnicity.

Social media, particularly Twitter, play a big role. Online “spotters’’ engage with people posting general questions about religion, says the report, which described an exchange that started as a calm discussion of faith before “hardened ISIS supporters slowly introduced increasingly ardent views into the conversation.’’

A spokesman for Twitter Inc. said in a statement, “Violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter, and our rules make that clear,” and pointed to Twitter’s terms of service, which say the firm will “take action” on accounts that threaten or promote violence.

Why the U.S. Pays More Than Other Countries for Drugs,"Prescription drugs are cheaper in many other countries than in the United States. The Wall Street Journal was able to pinpoint international drug-cost differences and what lies behind them. Photo: AP

Norway, an oil producer with one of the world’s richest economies, is an expensive place to live. A Big Mac costs $5.65. A gallon of gasoline costs $6.

But one thing is far cheaper than in the U.S.: prescription drugs.

A vial of the cancer drug Rituxan cost Norway’s taxpayer-funded health system $1,527 in the third quarter of 2015, while the U.S. Medicare program paid $3,678. An injection of the asthma drug Xolair cost Norway $463, which was 46% less than Medicare paid for it.

Drug prices in the U.S. are shrouded in mystery, obscured by confidential rebates, multiple middlemen and the strict guarding of trade secrets. But for certain drugs—those paid for by Medicare Part B—prices are public. By stacking these against pricing in three foreign health systems, as discovered in nonpublic and public data, The Wall Street Journal was able to pinpoint international drug-cost differences and what lies behind them.

What it found, in the case of Norway, was that U.S. prices were higher for 93% of 40 top branded drugs available in both countries in the third quarter. Similar patterns appeared when U.S. prices were compared with those in England and Canada’s Ontario province. Throughout the developed world, branded prescription drugs are generally cheaper than in the U.S.

The upshot is Americans fund much of the global drug industry’s earnings, and its efforts to find new medicines. “The U.S. is responsible for the majority of profits for most large pharmaceutical companies,” said Richard Evans, a health-care analyst at SSR LLC and a former pricing official at drug maker Roche Holding AG .

The reasons the U.S. pays more are rooted in philosophical and practical differences in the way its health system provides benefits, in the drug industry’s political clout and in many Americans’ deep aversion to the notion of rationing.

The state-run health systems in Norway and many other developed countries drive hard bargains with drug companies: setting price caps, demanding proof of new drugs’ value in comparison to existing ones and sometimes refusing to cover medicines they doubt are worth the cost.

The government systems also are the only large drug buyers in most of these countries, giving them substantial negotiating power. The U.S. market, by contrast, is highly fragmented, with bill payers ranging from employers to insurance companies to federal and state governments.

Medicare, the largest single U.S. payer for prescription drugs, is by law unable to negotiate pricing. For Medicare Part B, companies report the average price at which they sell medicines to doctors’ offices or to distributors that sell to doctors. By law, Medicare adds 6% to these prices before reimbursing the doctors. Beneficiaries are responsible for 20% of the cost.

The arrangement means Medicare is essentially forfeiting its buying power, leaving bargaining to doctors’ offices that have little negotiating heft, said Sean Sullivan, dean of the School of Pharmacy at the University of Washington.

Asked to comment on the higher prices Medicare pays compared with foreign countries, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said: “The payment rate for Medicare Part B drugs is specified in statute.”

In the U.S., few payers, public or private, cite cost as a reason to deny drug coverage, partly owing to a traditional emphasis in the U.S. on doctor and patient autonomy. “They don’t want to impinge on individual choices,” said Neeraj Sood, a health policy and economics expert at the University of Southern California.

Medicare Part B, for example, typically covers drugs and services deemed “reasonable and necessary.”

“If it’s a [Food and Drug Administration]-approved drug and prescribed by a duly licensed physician, Medicare will cover it,” said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid in the 1990s.

U.S. drug prices—showing regular increases, sometimes steep—are increasingly a focus of congressional probes and vocal criticism by insurers, doctors, politicians and consumers, who bear part of the cost.

Renee Andrews, an Oxford, Mich., resident whose son has juvenile arthritis and other conditions, said she can’t believe how low medication costs are for families overseas who post messages in her online support group. “Their out-of-pocket costs are considerably less than what we’re paying,” she said.

Research spending

The pharmaceutical industry says controls such as those seen in Europe discourage investment in research and deny patients access to some drugs. “The U.S. has a competitive biopharmaceutical marketplace that works to control costs while encouraging the development of new treatments and cures,” said Lori Reilly, an executive at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association.

If U.S. pricing fell to European levels, the industry would almost certainly cut its R&D spending, said Mr. Evans, the health-care analyst. “Does the U.S. subsidize global research? Absolutely, yes,” he said.

The higher U.S. prices also help drug makers afford hefty marketing budgets that in the U.S. include consumer advertising—something Europe doesn’t allow. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the S&P 1500 earn an average net profit margin of 16%, compared with an average of about 7% for all companies in the index, according to S&P Capital IQ.

For its analysis, the Journal started with Medicare Part B’s top drugs by payments to medical practices in 2013, the latest such data available. These are mostly drugs administered in a doctor’s office. Costs of drugs sold by U.S. pharmacies are harder to compare because of discounts and rebates.

After excluding drugs that faced generic competition in 2015 and those for which prices elsewhere weren’t available, the Journal compared 2015 third-quarter prices paid in the various jurisdictions. The analysis didn’t examine Medicare’s coverage of pharmacy-dispensed drugs, known as Part D, which is run by insurance companies that don’t reveal their pricing.

Some drugs, such as for HIV and hepatitis, cost less in certain overseas markets because companies cut prices for poor countries.

Norway is a wealthy nation, with gross domestic product per capita of $97,000 last year, versus $55,000 in the U.S., according to the World Bank.

In Norway the state pays for most prescription drugs, though patients pay for some used for short periods. The government controls costs in part by setting maximum prices. To do that, it reviews prices in nine neighboring countries and takes the average of the three lowest.

Cost-effectiveness

This system automatically holds prices low because the countries consulted also have government-controlled prices.

The Norwegian Medicines Agency, or NMA, then reviews patient data to decide whether a new drug is cost-effective. Its maker must request a reimbursement price at or under the maximum Norway has set and submit a detailed comparison of the drug’s cost and benefits versus existing treatments. Companies have teams of number crunchers to produce these comparisons, which can also prove useful in pitching products in the U.S.

Norway recommends that companies describe a drug’s cost per quality-adjusted life year, or QALY, a gauge used by many government health systems. Medicare is barred from using this gauge as a threshold to determining coverage.

Companies know Norway will sometimes deny coverage, and this threat is often “enough to get them to offer a discount,” said Kristin Svanqvist, head of reimbursement at the NMA. If rejected, they can offer a lower price.

When Amgen Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC sought coverage of the osteoporosis injection Prolia for certain women, the NMA concluded it wasn’t cost-effective compared with an existing infusion called Aclasta.

Aclasta is a different type of drug, a bisphosphonate. These have an advantage in binding to the bone, the NMA said in a 2011 report on Prolia, and protect against fractures for a longer time after treatment stops.

After Norway’s rejection, Amgen and Glaxo lowered Prolia’s price, according to Ms. Svanqvist. The NMA then ruled the health system would provide it for women 75 or older, for whom it appeared to work somewhat better, she said.

A syringe of Prolia cost Norway $260 in the third quarter. By the Journal analysis, that was 71% less than the $893 paid by Medicare, which doesn’t set an age test.

Amgen said, “We partner with local payers in Europe to help ensure that all appropriate patients who could benefit will have access to an important new therapy.” Glaxo referred questions to Amgen, to whom it sold Prolia’s Norwegian marketing rights in 2014.

If a manufacturer won’t budge on price, Norway might refuse to cover a drug altogether. It did that with a brand of insulin called Tresiba.

Producer Novo Nordisk A/S said Tresiba reduced nighttime dips in blood sugar better than other insulins and therefore was a good value. Ms. Svanqvist of the NMA called the documentation of this “quite lousy.”

“We think the reduction is actually quite low,” she said, and not “worth paying 70% more for.”

A spokesman for Novo Nordisk said it believes the drug provides better outcomes and is therefore cost-effective. He also said Norway didn’t ask the company to cut the price.

The way things often work, said Ms. Svanqvist, is that when drug companies are told a product isn’t cost-effective, they can provide more proof, and “if they don’t have better documentation they can only do something about the price. Very often they do something about the price.”

Denying patients access to drugs can be contentious. When Norway last year declined to cover Roche’s injected breast-cancer drug Perjeta because of its cost, “patients and physicians were on television and demonstrating a lot,” Ms. Svanqvist said. Roche agreed to a discount provided the NMA kept the terms confidential, which it grudgingly agreed to do, according to Ms. Svanqvist.

The agreement means Perjeta costs Norway less than the drug’s maximum allowed price in the country, which was $3,579 for a vial in the third quarter. Medicare paid $4,222.

Roche said Perjeta has shown strong efficacy, and the firm and Norway reached an agreement to make it available.

While U.S. payers sound dire warnings of unsustainable drug pricing, the tone in Oslo is much calmer. “We have a system that has been working quite well,” said Helga Festoy, an economist at the NMA.

Norway’s cost-effectiveness reviews sometimes cite the work of England’s health-care cost watchdog, known as one of Europe’s toughest. England’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, conducts extensive analyses and recommends that the taxpayer-funded health system not cover drugs providing low value. Sometimes after one is rejected, its maker offers a discount.

England also controls prices by capping the level of National Health Service spending on drugs each year and requiring the pharmaceutical industry to reimburse the NHS for any spending over those limits.

Of 40 branded drugs covered by Medicare Part B and also available in England in the third quarter, 98% were more expensive in the U.S., according to the Journal’s analysis of data from Medicare and the NHS’s Business Services Authority.

For instance, two syringes of Cimzia, an anti-inflammatory for rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases, cost England’s health-care system $1,117—less than half the $2,357 Medicare paid, the Journal found. An NHS spokeswoman said prices it publishes are “indicative,” and vary in some situations.

Cimzia is sold by Belgian company UCB SA. It didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Canada doesn’t have a single large pharmaceutical payer, but drug prices are substantially lower nonetheless, held in check by regulation.

A federal agency called the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board sets a maximum price for new drugs, based on factors including their therapeutic benefits and the prices in seven other countries—the U.S. and six European ones. Once a drug’s maximum price is set, the maker can’t raise it faster than the national inflation rate or above the highest price in the seven other countries.

A separate body, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, recommends whether provincial and other government health programs should cover new drugs for the elderly or for low-income residents. Government agencies in Canada don’t cover most drug costs for most other people.

One such program is run by Ontario’s Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Of 30 drugs that both it and Medicare Part B covered in the third quarter, 93% were more expensive in the U.S., according to the Journal’s analysis.

Countries with national health systems tend to feel “we are all in this together” and “we can’t afford everything for everybody at any price,” said Steven Pearson, a physician who founded the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a Boston nonprofit that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of health care. “In America it’s more, ‘Well, I’ve paid my insurance premium and I don’t want anyone to tell me no. I don’t want anyone to get in the way of me and my doctor.’ ”

Polly-Glot a Cracker in Many Tongues,"Bird salesmen (from left to right): Awalu Kulu, Hila Namama, and Ahmed Sani hold up African grey parrots at their roadside pet shop in Abuja, Nigeria. Photo: Drew Hinshaw/The Wall Street Journal

KANO, Nigeria—Hundreds of languages are spoken in this country: So which one do you teach a parrot?

It is a decision the pet shops of Nigeria confront every time a talking bird lands in their possession. Last year, a babbling grey parrot arrived at Salisu Sani’s bird stand in this northern city.

There was only one problem. She spoke one of the country’s lesser-known tongues.

African grey parrot

“I told her: ‘This is a rubbish language. Try my own,’ ” recalled the lifelong parrot distributor, who spent weeks teaching the animal greetings in Hausa, a more widely spoken vernacular.

Nigeria is one of the world’s easier places to buy a parrot—the garrulous birds are a status symbol for some civil servants. In traffic jams, young salesmen approach car windows holding up cages with birds inside. African greys sell for about $60.

But they sell closer to $100 if you can get them to speak.

The question is what Nigerians want their pets to say. The country’s 182 million people speak 520 different languages, according to Ethnologue, an atlas of the world’s linguistic boundaries, published by the International Linguistics Center in Dallas. Church services drag for hours as deacons translate their pastor’s sermons into three, sometimes four languages. Customer service lines begin with a plethora of options: one for English, two for Hausa, three for Yoruba, four for Igbo.

It makes the parrot business complicated, too.

A parrot will make almost any noise you throw its way. Leave one by a doorbell and it might say “ding-dong.” A rising number of pet parrots re-create the sound of their owner’s ringtone.

So parrots raised among a polyglot populace often wind up speaking the wrong language.

A few years ago in this northern city, Salim Mohammad’s cohort sourced a Cameroonian grey through Lagos, 500 miles to the south. By the time it arrived in Kano, it had picked up Yoruba, a language spoken only in Nigeria’s south. It took several months of standing on the side of the road with the caged bird before a motorist agreed to buy it.

The opposite problem confronts Murphy Taiwo’s Yoruba-speaking parrot peddlers down in Lagos. None of his half dozen bird handlers speak Hausa, but many of his customers do.

Three hundred miles north, in Abuja, parrot tender Awula Salisu and his co-workers are all Hausa-speakers. They coach parrots on sayings like “ina kwana” (good morning) or “aku” (parrot). But most of their customers speak Yoruba. Frequently, shoppers walk away, unhappy with the selection.

The 37-year-old bird handling veteran could, of course, hire a Yoruba person to come train his parrots. But that person wouldn’t be able to join in on their conversations.

“We are Hausa here,” he said. “He wouldn’t belong.”

The language barrier means some pollys can accidentally squawk parrot profanities.

In Kano, Mr. Mohammad bought a secondhand parrot from an American or possibly British expat leaving Nigeria. When he peered into the cage, the bird blared back: “Waka, waka!”

In Hausa, this is a very bad thing for a bird to say. Roughly translated, it means “your mother.”

“That one was misbehaving,” Mr. Mohammad recalled. “It took a long time to sell.”

Nigeria isn’t the only place where languages and parrots fly around with equal abandon. By a quirk of geography, parrots tend to live in the most multilingual corners of the world: the Amazon, Indonesia, Central Africa. In these lands, people sometimes struggle to communicate with the village a few miles away.

As it turns out, parrots face some of the same language barriers. There are untold hundreds of different parrot dialects. For example, birds in different parts of Costa Rica don’t use the same greetings, termed “contact calls” by ornithologists.

“In the north, they sound like ‘wah, wah! wah, wah!’ ” said Tim Wright, professor at New Mexico State University’s biology department. “Then in the south, they sound like ‘weep! weep! weep!’ ”

“After many years, I’ve managed to learn these,” he added.

Like humans, parrots tend to stick with birds that speak the same language. It’s how they create close-knit communities that rely on each to find food and avoid danger.

But dropped into a new environment, parrots—especially young ones—will try to crack the local vocabulary. Birds that grow in bilingual forests, where multiple parrot dialects are spoken, are also good at code switching between groups.

“That sociology is a very important part of being a parrot: It’s a survival strategy,” said Rowan Martin, researcher at the World Parrot Trust. “It’s really calls that promote group cohesion, so they’re all saying ‘I’m here! How are you?’ And it’s also saying. ‘I’m one of you.’ ”

This is why parrots mimic human voice, once caged and raised around humans. They’re trying to fit in with us.

These days, West Africa’s languages are slowly disappearing—dozens of Nigerian languages are spoken by less than 100 people. Parrots seem headed down the same path.

The parrots that survive find themselves in a noisier setting. The several birds that Atef Fawaz has owned in Kano have made the sound of cars, honking at his gate. One made the shrill beep that his fuse box emits anytime the power goes out, as it does daily: “He memorized that sound very well,” said Mr. Fawaz, a Lebanese businessman.

At Awula Salisu’s pet stand in Abuja, police routinely blare past, sirens wailing as they escort politicians across the capital. So his birds often make siren sounds.

In August, he received a bird that spoke Igala, the mother tongue of less than 1% of Nigerians. Mr. Salisu figured he would be stuck with the animal for months.

But days later, an Igala-speaking businessman showed up, delighted to find a bird that could talk his language. The man drove away with a broad smile.

Of course, Mr. Salisu had no idea what the bird—or its owner—were saying to each other, he said: “There are too many languages in this country.”

Yahoo Board to Weigh Sale of Internet Business,"One of the oldest and most well-known online companies, Yahoo, may be putting its core business up for sale. The WSJ's Rick Carew explains why.

Yahoo Inc.’s board is planning a series of meetings this week to consider selling off the company’s flagging Internet businesses and how to make the most of its valuable stake in Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -1.39%

The board is expected to discuss its options in sessions beginning Wednesday and continuing through Friday, according to people familiar with the plans.

Directors are likely to discuss whether to proceed with a plan to spin off its investment in Alibaba, currently worth more than $30 billion, find a buyer for Yahoo’s gaggle of Web properties, or both, the people said.

In a sign that change may be afoot at the company, a Yahoo executive recently canceled an appearance at a Credit Suisse investment conference that was planned for Tuesday.

Private equity firms are expected to be among those taking a look at Yahoo’s core business, people familiar with the matter said.

Growing concerns around Chief Executive Marissa Mayer’s lack of progress turning around Yahoo and an exodus of top executives have increased pressure on the company’s board to consider her future and alternatives to her turnaround attempt, now in its fourth year.

Activist investor Starboard Value LP last month called on the company to halt its Alibaba spinoff and instead find a buyer for its Internet business. In a letter to Yahoo, Starboard said its position changed following the federal government’s decision not to rule on whether the Alibaba spinoff would incur billions of dollars in taxes.

Yahoo President and CEO Marissa Mayer is shown in January 2014. Yahoo’s board plans to meet Wednesday through Friday to discuss whether to proceed with a plan to spin off more than $30 billion in shares of Alibaba, find a buyer for Yahoo’s core business of Web properties, or both, people familiar with the matter said.

Much of the value of Yahoo’s $31 billion market capitalization is tied up in two large Asian assets, Alibaba and Yahoo Japan .

Its 15% stake in Alibaba is now worth about $32 billion, and its 35% stake in Yahoo Japan is now worth about $8.5 billion. Yahoo’s cash and short-term investments totaled $5.9 billion at the end of the third quarter.

That would mean investors are valuing Yahoo’s core business at less than zero if the Asian assets were spun out tax-free. In a research report in October, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali valued Yahoo’s core business at $3.9 billion, not including cash.

Any buyer would have to contend with the complication surrounding the Alibaba stake. Yahoo failed to get prior approval of its plan from the Internal Revenue Service, raising the risk that the agency could later challenge the spinoff’s tax-free status.

Finding a buyer for part or all of Yahoo’s business could reduce or eliminate that risk, provided the buyer comes up with a plan for what to do with the Asian assets.

There is no guarantee any new deal for part or all of Yahoo will materialize. The company has considered big merger deals in the past, mostly notably several years ago with Microsoft Corp. , that it failed to strike.

Yahoo’s core business is shrinking, but it still represents some of the most visited services on the Web. Its properties, including Yahoo Mail and Yahoo News, are collectively the third-most visited Internet sites in the U.S., with 210 million visitors in October, according to comScore. Yahoo only lags Google Inc. and Facebook Inc.

Under Ms. Mayer, Yahoo has made investments in online video, advertising technology and mobile software that have failed to create meaningful traction for the company.

Ms. Mayer said in October she would adopt a new strategy to “reset” the company’s focus, without providing details. The CEO has hired management consultant McKinsey & Co. to look for areas of the company to cut, said a person familiar with the matter.

Yahoo is no stranger to takeover speculation. In 2008, activist shareholder Carl Icahn took a more than 5% stake in Yahoo, gained board seats and pushed it to sell to Microsoft in a deal that ultimately fell apart.

Last year, Starboard called on Ms. Mayer to consider a combination with AOL. Months later, Verizon Communications Inc. acquired AOL for $4.4 billion.

Yahoo shares rose 7% in after-hours trading following news of the breakup talks, after closing at $33.71 Tuesday.

"GOP Effort to Repeal Health Law, Defund Planned Parenthood Grows Complicated","‘When Americans think Obamacare, they think increased cost, runaway premiums,’ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, center, said Tuesday. Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images

WASHINGTON—It should have been smooth sailing. Senate Republicans combined two of their top policy priorities into a bill that can pass later this week without any Democrats.

Instead, this week’s vote will cap a protracted, behind-the-scenes campaign to find enough GOP votes for legislation that would both repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

The legislation is certain to be vetoed by President Barack Obama. But GOP leaders nonetheless waged a long struggle to secure enough support for the symbolic measure at a time Republicans see the health law as vulnerable.

They say approval of a repeal—and Mr. Obama’s veto of it—would pin political accountability for the law’s failings on the Democrats, who pushed the act through Congress almost six years ago over objections from most Republicans. Debate on the measure began Tuesday in the Senate.

Many people signing up for 2016 health policies face higher premiums and the biggest U.S. health insurer has threatened to withdraw in 2017 from exchanges set up by the law.

“When Americans think Obamacare, they think increased cost, runaway premiums,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on the Senate floor Tuesday.

Democrats counter that the health law has made historic achievements in reducing the number of uninsured people in America and improving insurance for those who had it.

The bill eliminating vast chunks of the 2010 health law and defunding Planned Parenthood cleared the House in October, but required major surgery to gather the 51 GOP votes needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold 54 seats. Senate Republicans plan to pass the bill under a special procedure tied to the budget process that requires only a simple majority, unlike the 60 votes most bills need to clear procedural hurdles. It would then return to the House before heading to Mr. Obama’s desk.

Republicans—who can afford to lose only three GOP votes in the Senate—had to rewrite the bill to mitigate dueling concerns from some conservative GOP presidential candidates and more centrist Senate Republicans.

Presidential hopefuls Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, along with Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), balked at an early version of the bill, which they said didn’t do enough to repeal the health-care law. It didn’t, for example, try to end the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid. And the bill’s provisions to repeal the health law’s individual and employer mandates hit problems given the Senate’s complicated rules.

But GOP leaders had to proceed gingerly because efforts to repeal more of the health law could have alienated some of the two dozen GOP senators up for re-election next year. For instance, quickly reversing the expansion of Medicaid could have hurt vulnerable lawmakers in states that have already enlarged the safety-net program.

The Planned Parenthood defunding brought further complications. GOP leaders also faced defections from centrists including Sen. Mark Kirk (R., Ill.), who has voted against defunding the group.

Senate GOP leaders labored for weeks to secure enough GOP votes. They refashioned the bill so that it could repeal more of the health law without violating arcane Senate rules. They kept in the measure defunding Planned Parenthood, but aides suggested that centrists might be able to express their opposition through amendment votes.

And they added in a provision ending the Medicaid expansion, but did so gradually, allowing states to phase it out over two years.

“For those senators who have states that expanded Medicaid, we’re making the clear point that if that decision’s reversed, it would be reversed in a way that states had time to adjust,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.).

As the debate began, Republicans predicted the maneuvering would win enough GOP votes, though the margin will be narrow.

Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican up for re-election next year in Ohio, which expanded the Medicaid program, wouldn’t weigh in on that provision Tuesday, saying he was still studying the bill. But Mr. Portman said he was pleased to see the legislation would boost funding for mental-health and drug treatment and supported the goal of forcing Mr. Obama to choose whether to veto the bill.

Mr. Lee was encouraged by the revisions to the bill, a spokesman said. It wasn’t yet clear whether Messrs. Cruz or Rubio, increasingly bitter campaign rivals, would soften their opposition to the legislation. Republicans said Tuesday that they were confident of cobbling together the votes needed to send the legislation to the White House.

Democrats, meanwhile, focused their criticism on GOP efforts to end the Medicaid expansion.

“In New Hampshire, this reckless proposal would revoke health-care coverage for over 44,000 low-income families now covered under Medicaid,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.).

White House Rejects Pentagon Plan to Close Guantanamo as Too Costly,"In this photo reviewed by the U.S. military, a communal area in an unused portion of the Camp VI detention facility for captured al Qaeda and Taliban militants is shown during a tour at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, in late 2013.

WASHINGTON—The Pentagon’s latest cost estimate for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and building an alternative in the U.S. topped a half billion dollars, prompting the White House to reject it and send the plan back for revisions, according to administration officials.

The cost dispute marked a setback for a top priority of President Barack Obama, and helps account for the administration’s delay in submitting a plan to Congress for closing Guantanamo.

The Pentagon estimated it would require as much as $600 million to close the prison, including a one-time capital investment of as much as $350 million in construction costs, according to officials familiar with the Pentagon plan, which hasn’t been released publicly.

The annual cost of operating the Guantanamo detention facility now is about $400 million. Under the Pentagon plans, operating a U.S.-based facility would run something less than $300 million, after the one-time costs, a defense official said.

The estimated costs prompted Mr. Obama to reject the plan during a meeting with Defense Secretary Ash Carter last month, and to send it back to the Pentagon, U.S. officials said.

Mr. Obama’s move further pushed back the submission of a plan to Congress, another in a series of delays since the White House said it would send the proposal to lawmakers this past summer.

The plan being drafted by the Pentagon is likely to be Mr. Obama’s last attempt before leaving office to get legislative approval for closing Guantanamo. The president is already facing strong bipartisan opposition in Congress to his longtime goal of closing the detention facility, and the White House anticipated that lawmakers would balk at the new cost estimates, officials said.

The estimates also threatened to undermine one of Mr. Obama’s top arguments for closing Guantanamo: that it is too costly to maintain.

Closing the facility and bringing detainees to U.S. soil also isn’t allowed under legislation that Congress passed and the president signed last month. In a signing statement at the time, Mr. Obama sought to leave himself some executive authority to circumvent Congress to close the facility. In the statement, he said the congressional ban could violate his powers as commander in chief.

The White House has said Guantanamo, which has long been a lightning rod for international and domestic criticism of U.S. policies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, cannot be closed without moving some detainees to U.S. soil.

Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman, said the administration is working to finalize a plan that would “safely and responsibly” close Guantanamo.

There currently are 107 detainees at Guantanamo who were captured as part of the U.S. war on terror after 9/11. Of those, 48 have been deemed eligible for transfer to other countries. Another 59 detainees are currently considered too great a security risk to transfer. Those detainees would be the most likely to be transferred to a facility in the U.S., should one be built.

Mr. Obama’s directive to Mr. Carter during a Nov. 10 meeting in the Oval Office was to refine the cost estimates and make them more manageable, U.S. officials said.

A senior Pentagon official said Mr. Obama asked the Pentagon to concentrate its reassessment on reducing the overall operating costs of a new facility in the U.S.—and not to focus as much on the one-time costs of construction or renovation.

Pentagon officials now are working to lower the estimates for an array of work required under the plan to design and construct a U.S. detention facility, with strict security and housing for the military police who would be responsible for guarding it.

That effort includes a host of engineering work and greater analysis of “operational issues”—from security measures and contracting concerns to transportation logistics and the protection of the military police on site, according to defense officials.

Pentagon officials said they are hamstrung in determining realistic cost estimates for closing Guantanamo because they must conform to current law, which prohibits the Defense Department from conducting extensive design work. Still, they are currently looking at a range of possibilities to trim those costs. One idea is to eliminate the requirement that detainees be tried by military commissions, and instead to try them in the federal court system, according to one senior defense official. Doing so would remove the cost of building a military judicial facility at the new prison, the official said.

Mr. Obama’s pledge to close the facility was one of his earliest campaign promises from the 2008 election. He has argued the detention center is a recruitment tool for terrorists and a drag on the federal budget. Within days of entering the White House, he vowed to close it by the end of his first year in office.

Closing the facility, however, has been politically and legally fraught for years. Mr. Obama misjudged early in his presidency the political blowback his efforts would attract—from Democrats as well as Republicans. He has been blocked from closing the facility, mainly by Congress’s continued ban on transferring detainees to the U.S.

Now, as he faces the last year of his second term, Mr. Obama has said he remains committed to closing the prison, and the White House has left open the possibility he would use his executive power to do it if Congress doesn’t change current law.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said last week that keeping the facility open is “not an efficient or effective use of taxpayer dollars when you consider the alternatives that are available.” He also said Mr. Obama’s goal of closing it wouldn’t be deterred by the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris.

As part of the president’s drive toward shuttering the facility, the administration has tried to steadily whittle down the population at Guantanamo by transferring detainees to foreign countries.

Those transfers have caused tension between the White House and the Pentagon.

Mr. Carter was charged with creating a plan to close Guantanamo after his successor, former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, was ousted in part because of his reluctance to transfer detainees.

Mr. Carter, however, has struggled in the process amid strong opposition from Capitol Hill, and ambivalence within the administration, toward efforts to close the facility.

Defense officials had planned to release a long-awaited blueprint for closing Guantanamo months ago, including at one point before Congress went on recess in August. But the Pentagon scrapped those plans when it became clear that blueprint would need to include cost estimates for constructing facilities in the U.S. that would be appropriate for housing detainees.

Earlier this summer, the Pentagon sent an assessment team to a number of existing facilities to determine if they would be suitable for housing detainees. Those included two military prisons, one at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and another at the Navy brig at Charleston, S.C. The team later conducted additional visits at the high-security prison called ADX Florence in Colorado, also known as Supermax, which houses some of the most dangerous convicts in the federal prison system, and military officials also visited a medium-security federal prison near Supermax, a state-run maximum-security prison about 10 miles away, the Colorado State Penitentiary.

The Pentagon hasn’t identified sites where it could construct facilities to house detainees, defense officials said. But the visits to those facilities formed the basis of the cost estimates Mr. Obama said were too high to consider.

Christie Counts on National Security Pitch to Boost Him in New Hampshire,"Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie speaks during a town hall meeting at the Louden, N.H., Fire Department on Monday. Photo: Darren McCollester/Getty Images

LONDONDERRY, N.H.—Diners gathered at a local breakfast spot here didn’t all expect to get a dose of Gov. Chris Christie with their eggs Tuesday morning, but they ate up his talk on national security.

“We’ve got to keep the American homeland secured, we have got to keep American citizens safe,” the Republican presidential candidate told patrons at Janie’s Uncommon Cafe. “There have been some folks who have lost focus on that, but I can guarantee that I never will.”

“Frankly, the more I listen to Chris Christie, I like his positions. I like his confidence but not arrogance,” said David Blundell, a retiree from Windham, N.H., who was at the cafe with his wife. “He just comes across as competent.”

Mr. Christie’s underdog campaign is getting a second look here after the New Jersey governor picked up endorsements, including one from the state’s largest newspaper, the Union Leader, and as protecting the U.S. from terrorism has become a more urgent concern in voters’ minds after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris.

“I would hope we would have people think twice about him and go back and see there are things they may have missed,” said Renee Plummer, a commercial real-estate developer from the state’s coast, who invited about 40 area officials to witness her endorsement of Mr. Christie Monday.

Mrs. Plummer said she picked Mr. Christie because of his law-enforcement experience, debate performances and willingness to take unscripted voter questions.

Related Bush Donors Voice Concern

Mr. Christie is highlighting his background as New Jersey’s former U.S. attorney as he tries to build momentum, after seeing prior promising moments in the race fizzle. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also are making concerted efforts in New Hampshire, and have outperformed Mr. Christie in state polls. They are trying to rally the establishment to their side as businessman Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz battle for the title of the outsider.

Mr. Christie, once viewed as a top-tier candidate, still has time to make a comeback. Rules for the state’s February primary allow undeclared voters to choose a candidate of either party, and local GOP officials expect undecided voters to decide in January—at the earliest.

“The center-right lane is jumbled, and it is likely to stay that way for quite a while,” said Thomas Rath, the state’s former Republican Party national committeeman, who is supporting Mr. Kasich but admires Mr. Christie, as well. “Voters know they really don’t have to decide until after the holiday, and they won’t.”

Mr. Christie has focused nearly his entire campaign on New Hampshire, a state that has previously backed establishment candidates such as Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Beyond national security issues, Mr. Christie is highlighting the need to deal with drug abuse, an issue that has risen to the top of voter concerns in New Hampshire.

On Tuesday, he talked about funding for drug treatment at a recovery center in Manchester. “He gets it. He speaks the language of treatment, recovery and addiction,” said Donna Sytek, New Hampshire’s first female Speaker of the House and former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, who endorsed Mr. Christie during the event Tuesday.

Mr. Christie’s favorability rating has started to improve after months of being underwater. A Suffolk University Poll in November found that 51% of 500 likely New Hampshire Republican voters had a favorable impression of him and 34% didn’t. A June Suffolk survey showed him with a 44%-42% split among Republicans.

State endorsements and a better likability rating are steps in the right direction, his supporters argue. “They are evidence that Gov. Christie is the right man for the time in the minds of many,” said Mike DuHaime, a senior Christie campaign adviser. “People are looking for a person with the right experience and strong leadership skills to tackle problems as varied as terrorism and entitlement reform.”

The Paris terrorist attacks carried out by those affiliated with Islamic State have scrambled the presidential race, political analysts said. The Suffolk poll found that 42% of GOP voters thought national security and terrorism were the top issues in the race, supplanting jobs and the economy.

The new focus generally benefits establishment candidates over outsiders such as Mr. Trump or former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston. Still, Mr. Trump ranked first among voters who told Suffolk they were looking for candidates who could handle terrorism and national security, followed by Messrs. Rubio and Cruz.

“It’s a moment, but there are many moments in a campaign. The test of a candidate is to expand those special moments to a larger narrative,” Mr. Paleologos said about Mr. Christie.

Mr. Christie has put a new priority on security in speeches and policy. “A couple of weeks ago this election changed dramatically,” said Mr. Christie, who held his 36th New Hampshire town hall at a fire department depot Monday evening. “The single most important responsibility of the president of the United States, in my opinion, is to protect the safety of the American people.”

The governor opposes settlement of Syrian refugees in New Jersey and has attacked the Obama administration from failing to thoroughly vet those they resettle. The State Department has defended its screening of refugees.

On Monday evening, Mr. Christie unveiled a coalition of law-enforcement officials backing his campaign, and some members mingled among the voters who gathered at a Loudon, N.H., fire depot. Mr. Christie spoke on the shop floor surrounded by firefighter uniforms hanging in closets, two firetrucks and a Sept. 11 poster on the wall.

“Do something to keep us safe here. I don’t think we can ignore ISIS,” said Edith Haskell, a retiree from Stratham, N.H. who votes Republican and attended the town hall.

Oil Glut: How to Tell When It’s Really Time to Worry,"Oil tankers during loading operations at the Aspropyrgos refinery in Athens last June. Photo: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News

“Fill ’er up,” a refrain that usually makes oilmen smile, is taking on an ominous tone for the energy industry.

There is now so much crude oil being pumped world-wide amid such tepid demand that producers are fretting over the possibility of a further sharp downward move in prices. The 93 million barrel question is how much more space there is to put it all and whether storage will be exhausted before the market is balanced.

Were that to happen, it could cause the oil-price rout to grow even uglier. For now, that prospect looks to still be a ways off even if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets this week, fails to curb output.

Yes, inventories are at unheard of levels. The International Energy Agency said last month that they kept climbing in September when they usually decline. But, despite reams of data on developed countries from the IEA and other agencies, traders still have only a hazy idea of how much space is left world-wide. This is because of less reliable data from developing nations when it comes to storage capacity.

One sign that there is nowhere left to stash oil on land would be the widespread use of so-called floating storage—putting it on supertankers with nowhere to go.

“If that happened, you’d see a market disruption,” warns John Kilduff, a partner at commodity investment firm Again Capital, who thinks the market is nearly saturated.

For that expensive form of storage to become attractive though, the spot price of crude would have to get even cheaper compared with the price at which it could be sold in the future as a financial contract. Oil analysts are scouring data on depots in obscure parts of the world to warn their employers about the bottom falling out of prices in this way.

The good news for the energy industry is that the futures market offers important clues about how likely that is to happen. Its message today is that the market is bent, not broken.

Photo: The Wall Street Journal

Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, explains this by comparing the futures curve for Brent, the global crude benchmark, with rates for supertankers on a per barrel, per month basis. Floating storage isn’t close to being viable today.

Any series of oil-futures prices can be cheaper or more expensive in more distant periods than they are now, conditions that are known as backwardation or contango, respectively. Today, crude is in unusually steep contango, which means a physical barrel can be bought, stored and immediately sold for a much higher price in several months.

But Mr. Tran calculates that, since supertankers aren’t viable for just a month, the price differential between a futures contract expiring in six months and the spot price would have to be nearly $7.00 a barrel to break even. Tuesday afternoon, it fell modestly to $3.91.

The upshot is that, while prices overall could rise or fall, contango would have to widen much more to signal real storage distress.

For the moment, in a glutted market, it is a refreshing tank-half-full perspective.

Red Mountain Turns Up Pressure on iRobot,"Colin Angle, iRobot co-founder and CEO, unveils new Roomba cleaning robot. Red Mountain Capital says it will seek seats on the company’s board. Photo: Eugene Hoshiko/Associated Press

Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC raised the pressure on iRobot Corp. IRBT -3.83% by disclosing plans to seek board representation at the maker of the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners.

The Los Angeles-based activist investor, headed by former Goldman Sachs partner Willem Mesdag, said it would nominate an unspecified number of candidates for director at iRobot’s next annual meeting, scheduled for May.

Red Mountain, which said funds it manages own 6.1% of iRobot, also said in a securities filing released Tuesday that iRobot should consider putting itself on the block. Since April, Red Mountain has been urging iRobot to shed its unprofitable peripheral businesses and focus on home-cleaning and maintenance robots, which accounted for 94% of sales in the nine months ended Sept 26.

Responding to Red Mountain, iRobot released a statement saying it was “focused on allocating capital” to the best opportunities for its shareholders and regularly evaluates strategic options.

Testing new markets is “what innovative companies are supposed to do,” Colin Angle, iRobot’s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview earlier this year. “If we only did the small, safe things, you would have never heard of us.”

Red Mountain argued that iRobot’s share price has long underperformed the market partly because the company has failed to focus on its profitable floor-cleaning business. The investment firm wants iRobot to sell its unit making defense-related robots and stop investing in an emerging “remote presence” business that aims to use robots to help people participate in remote meetings with colleagues or doctors.

Red Mountain’s letter also said iRobot was “hoarding” unneeded cash that the investor said could be used for more aggressive share repurchases. Red Mountain also said iRobot this year set up an undisclosed $25 million venture capital fund in Silicon Valley and called that “an egregious and abusive use of shareholder capital.”
