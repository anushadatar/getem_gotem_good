Has Europe Reached the Breaking Point?,"By the time of my visit, the broader question in Hungary and throughout the member nations was whether the European Union itself was falling apart. Twice in 11 months, Paris had been hit by vicious terrorist attacks, raising fears about European security and stirring anti-Muslim xenophobia. Europe’s far right was gaining strength, including the National Front in France. Europe’s undisputed leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, was in political trouble. Greece was still a financial mess. A demographic crisis loomed, given the rapid aging of many European countries. Out on the European periphery, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was making bloody mischief in Syria and Ukraine. And the United Kingdom was contemplating withdrawing from the union altogether.

The European Union was supposed to be an economic superpower, but after seven years it is still struggling to recover from the global economic crisis. Economic growth is sluggish at best (and uneven, given the divide between a more prosperous north and a debt-burdened south). Adjusting for inflation, the gross domestic product of the 19 countries now sharing Europe’s common currency, the euro, was less in 2014 than it was in 2007. Widespread joblessness and diminishing opportunities confront an entire generation of young Europeans, especially in Spain, Italy, France and Greece. The economic malaise tinges everything: Young people resist marriage for lack of economic opportunity. Poorer European countries are experiencing brain drains as many of their best young professionals and college graduates move abroad. Numerous Greek doctors, for instance, now work in more prosperous Germany while Greece’s health system is in crisis. Even as Toroczkai pushed back against migrants, he complained to me that too many young Hungarians had to leave for London or elsewhere to find work.

The migrants only accentuate the European paradox: A place of deepening pessimism for many of its own young people has become a beacon of hope and safety for migrants, many of them Syrian refugees who have been through the horrors of civil war. Many are young and educated, seemingly a timely fit for a region with an aging population. Except Muslim immigrants present a challenge to European ideals of tolerance, especially in a year of terror attacks, as far-right extremists and conservative political leaders like Orban warn that Europe’s security and ‘‘Christian values’’ are threatened — a reminder of just how fragile the European system has become.

Currently composed of 28 member states, from Germany, the industrial giant, to Malta, the tiny archipelago, the European Union is a bureaucratic machine jerry-built in pursuit of a utopian dream, the post-World War II vision that a unified Europe would be a peaceful and prosperous Europe. Nationalism and extremism had led to Hitler and the Holocaust and, before that, centuries of war. The New Europe was supposed to make future wars impossible and create harmony. The reality never matched the ambition, but considerable accomplishments ensued: the world’s largest single market; the open borders of the Schengen countries; the euro; and a progressive social and legal framework that has made the European Union a leader in environmental protection, renewable energy and human rights.

Modern Europe was put together incrementally, beginning with an industrial agreement in the early 1950s among six countries, with France and Germany at the center. Next came the Treaty of Rome in 1957, which created the European Economic Community, the European Union’s forerunner, at that point encompassing only Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The Maastricht Treaty in 1992 introduced requirements and a timetable to establish the common currency. Other treaties gradually brought in more member states, drawn to European prosperity and security, including the Baltics and parts of Eastern Europe in 2004 and 2007, in a final triumph over the Cold War.

But then came the 2008 economic crisis, followed by the convulsive aftermath of the Arab Spring, followed by the aggression of a revanchist Russia. Europe’s collaborative, consultative political style began to resemble indecisiveness. The inadequacy and weakness of the European Union’s institutions were glaringly exposed. Washington was mostly focused elsewhere, and European leaders continued to practice the high art of muddling through, in hopes that the broader European economy would revive soon and bring brighter political prospects. Instead, 2015 became the year that pushed Europe to the brink.

It began on Jan. 7, with the year’s first Paris terror attacks, when two French-Algerian brothers opened fire with automatic weapons inside the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A third gunman, a criminal-turned-Islamist, later killed a police officer and stormed a kosher grocery. In total, 17 people were killed. But the focus quickly shifted southward to Greece. On Jan. 25, the Greeks staged a revolt, electing as prime minister a radical leftist, Alexis Tsipras, who famously refused to wear a tie. Just 40, Tsipras had promised to put an end to economic austerity, the German-led European Union policy of trying to promote growth by reducing national budget deficits through mandated tax increases, spending cuts and structural reforms. Yet debt levels had grown in Greece, unemployment remained above 20 percent and its economy over the past five years had contracted by 25 percent.

In February, Tsipras and his flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, toured European capitals to urge Greece’s creditors to change the terms of the loans that had kept their country afloat. Germany, Finland and other creditors thought Greece was ungrateful and resisting the tough reforms needed to reverse decades of bad governance. In late June, everything blew up. Unable to secure more bailout money, Tsipras called a surprise national referendum, asking Greek voters to decide on the latest offer from creditors. They voted ‘‘no’’ — to no avail. Greece effectively defaulted on an I.M.F. loan as the government began running out of money. Tsipras closed banks, put capital controls in place and finally capitulated in July. He signed a new bailout deal with creditors that included the same sort of austerity measures he had spent months fighting. In August, he resigned. And in September, he was re-elected, though now his job in part was to carry out the terms of the new deal. Austerity had prevailed, even if fewer and fewer people thought it worked.

The Greek crisis was about an inward-looking Europe grappling with its own internal contradictions. But by summer and early autumn, Europe’s external contradictions had become even more acute. Two pillars of foreign policy — engagement with Russia and the maintenance of stability on the European periphery — were trembling. Ukraine was in crisis and at the center of a confrontation between the European Union and Putin. Dealing with him became even more complicated when Russia began bombings in Syria, aggravating a refugee crisis that already dominated the European agenda.

By midsummer, Syrian refugees discovered a shortcut to Europe through Lesbos, the Greek resort island. From January through October, according to Europe’s border-security agency, 1.2 million migrants illegally entered the European Union, a fourfold increase from a year earlier, many arriving on inflatable rubber dinghies or rickety boats. Europeans could have seen this as an affirmation of their exceptionalism — Syrians, Afghans, Eritreans, Gambians and others escaping war and poverty for the European dream. But Europe was overwhelmed and fearful, and largely unprepared.

In September, Angela Merkel nonetheless welcomed all Syrians to Germany, opening the door to as many as one million people this year — even though doing so meant suspending European Union rules. Europe’s power dynamics changed instantly. Germany is accustomed to dominating the agenda, but many countries refused to accept even modest refugee quotas from European officials in Brussels. The far right rose in polls in some countries, and national conservative leaders became increasingly bold. Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, declared himself the protector of Europe. Even in Germany, which had been so welcoming to refugees, arsonists attacked some refugee centers, while far-right extremists in Dresden staged demonstrations. Across Europe, anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant sentiment was rising.

On a gray day in November, I went to discuss this growing sentiment with Khalil Merroun, rector of the Grand Mosque of Évry-Courcouronnes in a suburb of Paris, one of the largest mosques in France. Big-bellied and jovial, Merroun, 69, is establishment Islam. He is a founding board member of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, the quasi-governmental body that regulates Muslim activities. His friend Manuel Valls, now France’s prime minister, personally awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country’s highest prize, and wrote the foreword to Merroun’s 2010 book, ‘‘French and Muslim: Is It Possible?’’

Merroun slipped out of his white burnoose and into his suit jacket, smiling as he settled into a chair. He had just finished Friday’s lunchtime prayers. ‘‘Five thousand people,’’ he said, gazing out his office window as a throng of Muslim worshipers streamed out of the prayer hall. Outside his office, two black-jacketed bodyguards assigned by French officials sat in the hallway. The security detail had been with Merroun since the January attacks in Paris, which had a profound impact on France. Flaws were exposed in French security and intelligence gathering. Debates erupted over French secularism and freedom of expression. Distrust of French Muslims deepened. In response, Merroun and other religious leaders held interfaith gatherings to promote tolerance.

Merroun leaned forward in his chair. Terrorism is ‘‘not jihad,’’ he said. The jihad of one’s self is about personal betterment and seeking greater understanding.

‘‘Today, you did a great jihad by coming to see me,’’ he said. ‘‘You called yesterday, you took the Metro, it was raining and you came here for a noble cause, to inform people. And I also made an effort, a jihad: I listened to you, I welcomed you and tried to transmit a message to better inform people, to try and dispel misconceptions and spread our true message, thousands of kilometers away, in the United States.’’

Merroun didn’t discount the venom directed at Muslims or refugees — this explained his security detail — but he thought the sour public mood was rooted in broader frustrations, like the lack of jobs. ‘‘So far, things have managed to remain relatively stable,’’ he said.

Our interview finished up shortly after 2 o’clock. I took the train back into Paris with a colleague. That night, less than eight hours later, three teams of suicide bombers and other heavily armed radical Islamists attacked Paris, killing 130 people.

To see why the European Union is breaking down, you must look under the hood, and the place to do that is Brussels. Recently, along Rue Montoyer, one of the many streets lined with law firms and interest groups that lobby European institutions, I found Emily O’Reilly, 58, a native of Ireland who holds the title of ombudsman for the entire European Union.

That same morning, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain had announced what he required to keep his country in the European bloc. During the British general elections in May, Cameron sought to appease anti-­Europe factions by promising to hold a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union. A date for the vote has not been announced — it will happen at some point before the end of 2017 — and it is too soon to know in which direction voters will lean. But the possibility that Britain could leave is already stirring dread in Brussels, especially because public disgust with Euro­pean governance is also rising in France and even Germany.

‘‘They want more Britain and less Europe,’’ O’Reilly said, distilling the essence of the British revolt.

O’Reilly’s job is to shine a light on the European system and redress a widely perceived lack of bureaucratic accountability. It is not a simple task, given the immensity and confusing powers of the European Union. She recently tried, and failed, to clearly explain to her husband the differences between the European Council, the Council of the European Union (sometimes called the Council of Ministers) and the Council of Europe. I mentioned that I was trying to figure the system out. ‘‘If you do that, come back,’’ she said. ‘‘Tell us all and make your fortune here.’’

O’Reilly is not naturally cynical about the European Union. She left school in 1975, two years after Ireland joined the European Economic Community. As a condition of membership, Irish lawmakers passed a new labor law that helped eliminate gender discrimination in the workplace. Those laws enabled O’Reilly to become a journalist before moving into her government career. European governance literally changed her life for the better. Now, though, young women and men in Europe are staring at joblessness, and the European Union is regarded as part of the problem.

‘‘What has to happen is that the experience I had as a young woman, as a young girl back in the ’70s, has to be replicated for the young girls in Greece and Italy and in Eastern Europe,’’ she said. ‘‘That hope and that potential that the E.U. held out for my generation has to be given to others.’’

Critics often use ‘‘Brussels’’ as shorthand for the whole sprawling European project, hence the ‘‘Brussels Bubble.’’ There is a basic institutional structure, with a certain degree of checks and balances. The European Commission is roughly equivalent to an executive branch. Then there is an elected legislative branch, the European Parliament. A third branch, the European Council, consists of the elected leaders of the 28 member states (and shares a building with the Council of the European Union, a forum for national ministers to hash out various shared policies). Beneath those main branches is a labyrinthine bureaucracy that in flowchart form would resemble an M.C. Escher print. The overall processes of lawmaking and governing can be elusively fluid and deliberately opaque, which is one reason the credibility of European governance is so easily attacked. Many ordinary people have little idea how it works.

The European Union has no equivalent to the United States Constitution but is a product of the succession of treaties ratified by member states, a process closer to that of the Articles of Confederation, America’s original governing document, which ultimately failed. If these treaties have steadily pushed Europe toward greater integration, the job is far from complete.

European Union institutions have vast regulatory powers over everything from data roaming to environmental standards to trade deals to antitrust rules. But power is not shared equally. The European Commission, for example, is supposed to enforce the bloc’s treaties — yet it must sometimes tiptoe around big member states like France and Germany. And as a whole, the institutions often lack the structural power, political decisiveness and bureaucratic efficiency to act collectively when faced with big, unforeseen problems like the Greek crisis, the surge of migrants or the standoff with Putin over Ukraine. National leaders are often forced to decide these issues in marathon emergency meetings in Brussels at the European Council, and even then, only incremental progress is made. It is a perfect recipe for public cynicism: a system of intrusive regulators whose tentacles can spread into your personal life, even as leaders appear indecisive in the face of genuine crises.

Because the system is incomplete, workarounds are often needed to get things done. O’Reilly explained one element of the ad hoc system of power sharing that has grown up in Brussels with a term of art: ‘‘trilogue.’’ Trilogues are semiofficial meetings, often conducted with minimal transparency, of lawmakers from the European Parliament, representatives from national governments and bureaucrats from the European Commission. Together they hammer out legislation that is later put to a vote in the European Parliament and other Euro­pean Union institutions. It is back-room politics, Brussels-style. O’Reilly, who is investigating the practice, said many people think trilogues help cut through bureaucracy to get things done, but they also raise questions about transparency and a broader lack of checks and balances.

To many experts across Europe, this messy, opaque style of governance undermines the credibility of a European experiment intended to be a model of democracy. They say the solution to this arguably antidemocratic form of democracy is obvious: a new treaty ratified by all member states that would further consolidate political and financial authority in Brussels while improving systemic shortcomings. Or exactly the sort of dilution of national sovereignty that is now fueling far-right populist anger in Europe. Almost no one believes a new treaty could be approved anytime soon. A decade ago, when the European Union was trying to ratify a treaty that would establish a European Constitution, President Jacques Chirac of France supported the choice, in a national referendum, that would have given more authority to Brussels over a range of issues, from foreign policy to housing to fisheries. Voters in France shocked political elites by rejecting the Constitution, partly out of fear that the measure would erode French sovereignty. Soon after, voters in the Netherlands did the same thing.

‘‘Ever since then, we’ve been on a slippery slope,’’ Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy in Brussels, told me. ‘‘Every elected national leader knows there is no political mileage to try to lead on European issues or push for more integration. The European idea is now a rapidly declining trend.’’

Five days after the attacks in Paris, I met Laszlo Toroczkai in his office in Asotthalom. He told me he respected Islam but found it unsuitable for Europe. ‘‘My third daughter is about to be born,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m not bringing up my daughter to marry into a Muslim man’s harem.’’

Photo

It was the sort of overtly bigoted remark that has become more common in Hungary and elsewhere in Europe (and not so unfamiliar in the United States too). Many Hungarians mocked his anti-­illegal-immigrant video, but Toroczkai’s stature rose within Europe’s far right. Earlier in November, he was invited to speak at a Polish Independence Day rally in Warsaw, where thousands of far-right supporters waved flags and displayed banners with messages like ‘‘Stop Islamization.’’ Toroczkai told me that the Paris attacks — two of whose perpetrators apparently passed through Greece posing as refugees — had proved him correct.

If the migrant crisis had exposed fault lines in the Schengen system, this second Paris attack threatened to demolish it. Some suspected terrorists had traveled to and from Syria. Others had seemingly moved freely back and forth between Brussels and Paris. Open borders now meant Europe was more open to terror.

‘‘Migration is just going to lead to bloody conflict,’’ Toroczkai said. ‘‘European politicians will have to listen to public opinion, which is radicalizing all over Europe as a result of this migration crisis.’’

Above all, the crisis, like the Hungarian fence, had underscored the fact that erasing borders never quite erased divisions among countries with different languages, customs and histories. The European Union expansion in 2004, which took in parts of Eastern Europe, stirred deep economic anxiety in France and contributed to the defeat the next year of the French effort to approve a European Union Constitution. Its opponents invoked the ‘‘Polish plumber’’ as a symbol of cheap outside labor that threatened the French working class. Now the arrival of migrants is again challenging European ideals.

Europe is not usually considered a continent of immigrants. When countries like France and West Germany recruited workers from Algeria and Turkey in the 1960s to fill labor shortages, the common expectation was that many of them would eventually return home. Anyone riding the subway in Paris can see that the French capital is one of the most diverse places in the world, yet France has struggled to absorb even second- and third-­generation French Muslims, often because of difficulty balancing Islam with French secularism. In Germany, Islam is managed in part through diplomacy; many imams are provided, by agreement, by a religious ministry of the Turkish government. France has a similar setup with Morocco, Algeria and other majority-Muslim countries.

The chief defender of European openness has been Merkel, but she has paid a political price. Far-right parties quickly made gains in the polls while her support dropped, and fellow conservatives criticized her sharply. (Germany eventually announced border restrictions on migrants entering the country.)

On Nov. 2, I traveled to Darmstadt, in south-­central Germany, to watch her conduct a meeting with hundreds of rank-and-file members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union party. An outpouring of German volunteers had helped migrants, but many here were concerned. A software engineer worried that the migrants would be an extra burden at a time when, he feared, Germany was losing its competitive edge. Another man bemoaned that Germany was losing its Christian values. Others lamented that there were not enough jobs or warned that towns and villages were already overwhelmed.

Merkel listened to each remark, dutifully took notes and then offered roughly the same response: We can do it, she said again and again. Germany has to lead on this. We will be fine. Everyone applauded, but the mood seemed heavy. There still didn’t seem to be a plan. Afterward, I cornered an engineer named Martin Spruch, who had told Merkel that the rest of Europe had abandoned Germany on the matter of refugees. ‘‘We cannot do this all alone,’’ he told me.

Since the Paris attacks, President François Hollande of France has stood by the country’s commitment to receive a modest number of refugees. Yet he has instituted border controls and warned that Europe must secure external borders or risk member countries sealing themselves off. And this, he added, would amount to a ‘‘dismantling of the European Union.’’ In early December, Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France, scored major victories in regional elections, raising the once-unthinkable possibility that the far right has a chance at the presidency in 2017.

On the day I visited the Hungarian fence, I noticed a black van parked outside the town hall in Asotthalom. Inside was a small delegation of politicians from Belgium, led by Filip Dewinter, the leader of the far-right Vlaams Belang party. Belgium was reeling after investigators discovered that some of the suspected organizers of the Paris attacks lived only a few miles from the European Parliament. For days, the police locked down the city searching for suspects.

Dewinter, whose party once notoriously used a photo of his teenage daughter in a bikini and a niqab as part of a ‘‘Women Against Islamization’’ campaign, had come to Hungary on a ‘‘fact-­finding mission’’ about the fence and to film videos. His party had fared poorly in Belgium’s last election, but he thought the combination of the migrant crisis and the Belgian connection to the Paris attacks boded well for him. He thought the fence was a great idea.

Eight days after the Paris attacks, I walked through the Maidan, the central square of Kiev and the symbolic heart of Ukraine. This is where Ukraine’s Maidan revolution began two years earlier, when people took to the streets, furious over a promise broken by President Viktor Yanukovych. He had backed away from signing a political and economic ‘‘association agreement’’ with Europe and turned toward Russia. Images of the protests, which spread to other cities, were carried around the world and showed crowds of young Ukrainians, waving European Union flags, desperate to be part of the West.

Today was the anniversary. It rained on this day two years ago, and it was raining now, but otherwise everything felt different. Ukraine had endured two years of war, economic collapse and political upheaval, with thousands dead and more than a million displaced. Europe had stumbled into a new Cold War and learned the costs of misjudging Russia. Ukraine was never supposed to be a problem for Europe; in fact, it was thought to be the opposite of that, a chance to expand Europe’s orbit and stabilize its periphery — on its own terms and on the strength of its soft power.

For centuries, power politics in Europe meant guns and wars (and the influence of the Vatican, given the sometimes belligerent role of past popes). But the European Union has been a relatively pacifist body, most prominently when France and Germany strongly opposed the George W. Bush administration’s invasion of Iraq. Britain and France are still military powers, and the Italian Navy remains active in the Mediterranean, but the European Union has sought to exercise global influence through its economic strength and democratic values. Leaders saw trade and closer ties as enough to maintain stability on the European borders.

Photo

Ukraine changed that. First, Putin shattered Europe’s sense of security after the Maidan protests grew violent. The police attacked; protesters died. Under pressure, Yanukovych fled to Russia. Putin responded by seizing Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula where Russia leased a port for its Black Sea fleet. Then pro-­Russia separatists, backed by Russian forces, escalated the war in Ukraine’s industrial east, where sporadic shooting still continues despite a fragile cease-fire — even as skeptics say neither side really wants to implement the accord. In the midst of all this, Ukraine elected a coalition government that signed the association agreement with the European Union and pledged to carry out reforms. Ukraine’s government is also negotiating for visa-free access to European Union countries. That would be a tangible success, signaling closer ties, but those talks have been complicated by European concerns about border security after the Paris attacks. The government is also trying to satisfy European demands that would allow Ukraine to enter a free-trade pact with the European Union.

But Ukrainian reformers want more European involvement, money and commitment, even a path to eventual European Union membership, as they try to rebuild a country still hobbled by corruption, dominated by oligarchical interests, divided ethnically and locked in a confrontation with Russia. Their argument is that Ukraine can never become secure or democratic without Europe, and that Europe can never be secure, or truly fulfill its ideals, without a stable, democratic Ukraine.

‘‘Ukraine needs this success,’’ Ostap Semerak, a pro-­reform lawmaker, told me. ‘‘And the European Union needs this success.’’

Europe itself, though, is increasingly ambivalent. Russia, not Ukraine, has long been the greater concern. Led by the Germans, Europe long pursued a foreign policy rooted in the belief that economic interdependence with Russia would ensure political stability, just as it had between once-mortal enemies like France and Germany. Russia sold natural gas to Europe. Europe sold machinery and luxury goods to Russia. Europe’s east, meanwhile, inevitably became a place of geopolitical competition, as new member states like Lithuania and Poland regarded the integration of Ukraine in some fashion as a security priority.

Europe’s internal crises are now dominating its agenda, with some leaders eager to normalize relations with Russia and effectively return to business as usual. Merkel and Hollande are trying to secure a lasting peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but European attention has shifted to Syria, refugees and terrorism. Hollande is focused on trying to put together a coalition against the Islamic State — one that would include Russia. Merkel traveled to Istanbul to woo President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey — despite her prior criticism of his authoritarian impulses — and in November, the European Union agreed to pay three billion euros to Turkey to help stanch the flow of migrants pouring across Turkish borders. It even reopened talks about Turkey’s long-stalled bid to join the European Union. Europe had dumped soft-power diplomacy for a scrambling, even desperate, embrace of realpolitik.

I visited a handful of reformers and analysts in Kiev during the Maidan anniversary weekend, and Europe’s sudden overtures to Russia had not gone unnoticed. Anxious scenarios circulated: A Europe desperate to strike at terrorists might cut a deal for Putin’s help (because his military was also now involved in Syria), possibly ending the economic sanctions put on Russia in response to its aggression in Ukraine or making concessions in the peace talks.

During the anniversary on the Maidan, people walked slowly in the rain, stopping at different memorials. Two teenage girls huddled under an umbrella, crying as they stood beside rows of photographs of people who died. ‘‘Mostly, Europe doesn’t care what is happening in Ukraine,’’ Anne Levchuk, who said she was 17, told me. ‘‘They can’t really feel what we feel.’’

The fundamental uncertainty about Europe’s future is when prosperity will return. Will things soon turn around? Or is Europe in the midst of a crippling decline similar to Japan’s lost decade? The European Central Bank is trying to play the role of savior — pumping money into the financial system — but the question is whether it, alone, can pull it off.

European countries once managed to have strong economies and generous social safety nets, as social democracy became Europe’s political mainstream. That formula collapsed in the 2008 economic crisis, though even today Europe is divided on where to place the blame — a bloated welfare state or decades of corrupt governance, or both. Europe’s left defended the old socialistic model even as the consensus in Berlin and Brussels had long since shifted to pro-market, ‘‘neo-liberal’’ policies. Greece became a battleground for different economic visions but also a test case of how Europe handles an effectively bankrupt state in its midst, with a legacy of political corruption.

Ten days after the Paris attacks, I went to Greece to visit Alexis Tsipras. He adjusted the two wing chairs in his office, catching the light through the window, and invited me to sit down. Tsipras wore a blazer and khakis, still tieless, still prime minister. He seemed weary, even a touch forlorn, staring down at his lap. Can an entire country seem exhausted?

‘‘I think it’s not so easy to change Europe when you are alone,’’ Tsipras said, speaking in practiced English.

Tsipras is beaten, but he still thinks he is right. The euro crisis is not solved. Europe has a common currency but not a common financial system. Greek debt is still unsustainable. The ‘‘recipe,’’ as he calls austerity, has been proved wrong. Why, he asks, has economic growth and employment recovered so much faster in the United States than in Europe? He still attacks the consensus in Berlin and Brussels as straitjacketed economics enforced by creditors, in defiance of logic, unable to produce real growth. Many economists agree. But Tsipras’s critics argue that he offered no real alternative other than old-style Greek clientelism. He misplayed his confrontation with Berlin and Brussels. (They did, too.) His job now is to administer what he regards as the wrong medicine, hope his country doesn’t implode while he makes it attractive to private investors and then try to recover and ‘‘regain our sovereignty.’’

‘‘We saw that there is no other way,’’ he said. ‘‘Our European partners and Germany were very, very tough.’’

The Greek crisis was never only about the country’s problems; it was also about Europe’s power equations, as well as volatility in the financial markets. To renegotiate Greece’s debt and make real concessions meant possibly opening the door to renegotiations with debtor countries like Italy, Portugal and Spain. Other creditors would be staring at new liabilities and infuriated voters. Even the Baltic countries and the Eastern Europeans had more contempt than sympathy for Greece, because of Greece’s higher standard of living. A crisis rooted in economics was fought in the realm of politics, infused by moralism (Lazy Greeks versus Mean Germans) and national self-interests. A common currency intended to bring nations together had done the opposite.

It might never have been realistic to envision a United States of Europe. Yet the prospect of a weaker Continent is something that should alarm Washington; Europe and America are trade partners, are bound together militarily by NATO and share a commitment to democracy. Many European bureaucrats and officials cling to the belief that crisis has always made Europe stronger and more integrated. Yet the optimism that carried the project forward to stop wars and create prosperity is dwindling. Now the challenge of the Euro­pean Union is whether it can succeed in continuing to bring a better and more secure life to a larger and more diverse group of citizens. Has the European Union reached the practical limits of the ideal of an ever-closer union? Europe’s binding glue now might well be fear — fear of the unknown, of what will happen if Greece does tumble out of the eurozone, or if Britain chooses to leave the European Union.

Tsipras said he still considers himself pro-­Europe, as most Greeks are, and took heart from rising leftist parties in Portugal and Spain. ‘‘Greece is not alone anymore,’’ he noted. But he described Brussels as ‘‘the kingdom of bureaucracy,’’ a place where ‘‘there is a lack of democracy — the most important decisions are taken behind closed doors.’’ It might have sounded like resentment from someone who tried and failed to knock down the palace gate. But it was what I heard everywhere I went. Indeed, Tsipras seemed to capture the European moment.

‘‘I am very, very skeptical for the future,’’ he said.",REAL
The New Attack on Hispanic Voting Rights,"As a new member of the growing Pasadena business community, Del Toro became more attuned to the sense of inequality that residents felt on the north side. His customers complained about the sinking sidewalks, about the antiquated drainage systems that turned streets into lagoons during rainstorms. In 2008, Mayor Isbell gave a speech to the Chamber of Commerce in which he linked a new policy cracking down on traffic infractions — drunken driving, driving without insurance — with another policy reporting the immigration status of all those arrested to immigration authorities. To Del Toro’s ears, Isbell was scapegoating undocumented immigrants for all the city’s problems: They drink too much; they cause accidents but they have no car insurance. Del Toro walked out. In his view, Isbell was trying to distract people from what really mattered, the way the south side had flowers and the north side had weeds.

In 2009, one of Del Toro’s customers, Dana Philibert, a white insurance agent, decided to run against Isbell, promising voters to spend city money more wisely. Del Toro offered to help her by going door to door in the Spanish-speaking north, the way he had for his own business. She lost, but Del Toro realized he had an appetite for American-style politics. Philibert was a Republican, so Del Toro, a golf-playing member of the N.R.A., attended a couple of local Republican meetings, but he quickly decided the party was not for him: not only because Isbell and other Pasadena Republicans had become increasingly bellicose about undocumented immigrants, but also because of its stance on abortion rights and, he emphasized, gay rights — ‘‘I always admired the United States in that aspect,’’ he said. ‘‘You are fine the way you are. You don’t have to be something else.’’

The Democrats seemed more welcoming, perhaps because they had been shut out of state government for years and had come to see the growing Hispanic population as their only hope of reclaiming power. Texas is on track to become majority Hispanic by 2042, and Hispanic voters prefer Democrats, choosing them in national elections at rates as high as 70 percent. Theoretically, this should mean that Democrats are in ascendance in the state, but in election after election there has been little evidence of such a trend, in part because Hispanic turnout is typically very low.

In 2014, when State Senator Wendy Davis tried to make new inroads with Hispanics during her campaign for governor, Del Toro again volunteered, knocking on the doors of Spanish-speaking households in Pasadena. But Hispanic turnout remained extraordinarily low, and Davis lost spectacularly.

Nonetheless, at the local level in Pasadena, the booming Hispanic community saw its political clout increasing. In the previous few years, two Mexican-American Marine veterans, Ornaldo Ybarra and Cody Ray Wheeler, had been elected to the City Council, shaving Isbell’s majority to a single vote. A fifth council seat, also in a heavily Hispanic area, seemed primed to go next, and with it, the mayor’s lock on power. Del Toro began to pay closer attention to the situation in his adopted town. He was 52; he had been in the United States for 14 years, but he was just beginning to understand how American politics worked. And what he was learning infuriated him.

With the political stakes rising, the mayor had made an unexpected move: He proposed a ballot initiative reducing the number of Council districts to 6 from 8, while adding two new at-large council seats that would now represent the entire city. At-large offices might seem more democratic, as they are selected by the entire city instead of only the people in one district. But because Hispanic turnout was so low in citywide elections, whites could outvote them every time. Under the new plan, the mayor’s majority would almost certainly be safe. ‘‘They create two at-large districts basically as a way to ensure that power was kept on that side,’’ Del Toro said, gesturing to the south.

Isbell was not the first Texas politician to propose such a plan; this same tactic has been tried in various cities around Texas, including Galveston and Freeport. But since at-large districts have long been associated with disenfranchisement, those proposals were usually blocked by the United States Justice Department under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. For decades, Section 5 allowed federal authorities to reject voting laws — and redistricting plans — that they deemed discriminatory in Texas and in 14 other states with histories of suppressing minority voters. But in June 2013, in a case known as Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court rendered Section 5 moot, because the country had, in the majority’s opinion, moved beyond its racist past. Isbell was free to do as he saw fit. When the initiative finally went before Pasadena voters, it won by just 79 votes.

Del Toro determined that if the law couldn’t stop Isbell, then maybe he could, by running for one of the new citywide seats. He knew it was almost certainly a losing battle, he said, but ‘‘sometimes you have to fight a lost cause to win something.’’ In February, he went to Pasadena City Hall to personally file his official candidacy form, signing his name by the X, beneath the line that read: ‘‘I am a citizen of the United States.’’

2. ‘The last line of defense’

On March 15, 1965, Lyndon Johnson went before a joint session of Congress to demand the passage of the Voting Rights Act, a sweeping new law granting the federal government exceptional power over states to stop the ‘‘systematic and ingenious discrimination’’ that had crushed the black vote throughout the South. Critically, Section 5 of the V.R.A. gave the federal government the power to block any new voting law that could not be proved to be free of discrimination in states where systemic racism and repression had a long history — primarily the former Confederate states, including Texas, but also a collection of counties or townships in non-Confederate states. Black enfranchisement soared, culminating in 2008, when black turnout rates finally reached parity with white turnout rates, and America elected its first black president, Barack Obama.

As I wrote in Part 1 of this series, in August, Obama’s election was followed by a sudden return of restrictive new voting laws, most of them disproportionately affecting minorities, that were enacted by newly empowered Republican legislatures throughout the country. There were reductions in early voting days, which make it easier for the working poor to get to polls and which have been used with particular effectiveness by black churches running Sunday ‘‘souls to the polls’’ drives. There were rollbacks of laws that allowed people to register and vote at the same time, a vital convenience for lower-income Americans, who more regularly change addresses and would otherwise need to continually update their voter information. And there were new photo-ID laws that placed strict limits on which types of identification would be accepted at polls: The law in Texas accepted gun permits, held predominantly by whites, but not state school or employee IDs.

Civil rights lawyers argued — and, in several cases, courts agreed with them — that these were modern-day versions of the kinds of laws that Congress intended to block when it passed the V.R.A. When Section 5 of the V.R.A. was intact, the states under its oversight could go only so far. For instance, in 2012 a federal panel of judges blocked Texas’s ID law, and the Justice Department delayed Mississippi’s photo-ID law by asking for more information about any potentially discriminatory effects. Alabama passed an ID bill, too, but held off implementing it pending Section 5 approval. Then came the Shelby decision. It was the single biggest shift in the voting rights landscape since 1965, and, longtime civil rights leaders said, the single biggest setback. Afterward, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama all moved forward with their voter-ID laws. (A federal appeals panel ruled in August that the Texas ID law was discriminatory, but it remains in place as the appeal process continues.) In North Carolina, the Republican legislature enacted a huge new package of voting restrictions — including a voter ID law and rollbacks in early voting — that disproportionately affected minorities. (The package is also under challenge in federal court.) And several counties in Georgia moved forward with plans to eliminate polling places or move election dates, making it harder, local civil rights leaders fear, for blacks and Hispanics to vote.

The 2016 presidential election will be the first to take place after the gutting of the V.R.A. and with all of these new laws potentially in place. Civil rights lawyers are just as concerned about provisions they don’t yet know about — the last-minute changes that could deter voters in ways that were previously disallowed. North Carolina, Virginia and Florida are among the states previously covered in whole or in part by Section 5, and they will be closely contested. Marc Elias, a longtime Democratic lawyer and the lead counsel for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, told me, ‘‘You are likely to see more litigation over the fundamental right to vote this election cycle than we have seen since the passage of the Voting Rights Act.’’

But the bigger voting rights fight isn’t about the map of today. It’s about the map of tomorrow, which will be reshaped by Hispanics in ways that could realign national politics for generations. Hispanic Americans have faced a long legacy of white hostility, dating back to the mid-19th century, when Texas state and local officials began a sporadic campaign to chase Hispanic citizens from polls with threats of violence or prison. Congress placed Texas under Section 5 oversight in 1975, based partly on its continued use of English-only ballots. But even now, Hispanic citizens are registering and voting at levels that are not much better than those of blacks near the end of Jim Crow — a 38.8 percent turnout in Texas in 2012, according to the Census Bureau, as opposed to more than 60 percent for both blacks and ‘‘Anglos,’’ the widely used informal term for non-Hispanic whites. (In the census, Hispanics can be of any race, and do not count as a racial category.)

If Hispanics were to start registering and voting in the same percentages that Anglos do in Texas, and continued to prefer Democrats over Republicans in the same proportions that they do now in presidential elections, Democrats would be able to shave the 16-point deficit they saw there in 2012 to 6 points by 2024 — less than the deficit the party faced in Virginia in 2004, four years before it managed to win the state. Continuing demographic trends would push Texas toward the Democratic column by 2036, but by then national Democrats, seeing a winnable presidential race, would already be flooding the state with money, staff and volunteers — something they haven’t done in earnest in nearly 20 years — to put it in their column even sooner. Projections have shown black and Hispanic population growth combining to force a similar dynamic in Georgia by as early as 2020 and making North Carolina a safer Democratic bet by 2024 or 2028; Hispanic growth alone could make Arizona competitive for Democrats by 2024, if not sooner.

The stakes are highest in Texas. Its 38 Electoral College votes make it ‘‘the last line of defense’’ against the Democrats, its Republican governor, Greg Abbott, has said. This explains why liberal groups like Battleground Texas have started spending so much money — $10 million in 2013 and 2014 — on, among other efforts, registering new voters. It also explains why Representative Louie Gohmert, a Republican from Texas, would go on the conservative cable network NewsMax TV to charge that the Obama administration was encouraging undocumented immigrants to come into the country to vote illegally. The right defense against those illegal voters, he suggested, was Texas’ voter-ID law. If they’re not stopped, Gohmert warned, ‘‘it will ensure that Republicans don’t ever get elected again.’’

3. ‘They just don’t know it yet’

In September 1999, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas met with the Mexican president at the time, Er­­nesto Zedillo, on the Texas border. With a mariachi band ready to play, the two embraced, and then cut the ribbon on a new bridge linking Eagle Pass, Tex., with the Mexican town of Piedras Negras. Standing at a lectern bearing the Mexican coat of arms, Bush said from the span, ‘‘Bridges, not walls, are the finest monuments any public official can leave.’’

At the beginning of his 2000 presidential campaign, Bush was telegraphing his answer to the question that Republicans had been fighting over for decades: what to do about the His­panic population, whose rapid growth in the United States was outstripping that of whites. Gov. Pete Wilson of California had rallied his Anglo base by proposing nativist laws that effectively banned bilingual education and denied benefits to undocumented immigrants and their children. But Bush took a different approach. He seemed to agree with a statement attributed to Ronald Reagan, that Hispanics were Republicans who ‘‘just don’t know it yet.’’ It was Reagan, after all, who signed the 1986 bill that granted amnesty to more than three million immigrants who had come to the United States illegally. Bush publicly disavowed Wilson’s approach, saying he would not ‘‘use our children, the children of immigrants, as a political issue in America.’’

Wilson went down in history as the governor who took California off the Republican presidential map for at least a generation. Bush positioned his fellow Texas Republicans to gain full control of state government, then won the presidency, and held onto it in 2004 with the largest Republican share of the Hispanic vote — 44 percent — in history. The question seemed resolved.

But midway through Bush’s second presidential term, the nation’s undocumented immigrant population hit its peak of more than 12 million. That was when the party began to sound a lot more like Wilson. When Bush tried in vain to pass a bill creating a ‘‘path to citizenship’’ for undocumented immigrants, not a single member of his home state’s Republican congressional delegation stepped forward to help him. Those Texans argued that Bush didn’t understand how much the immigration debate had changed back home, how the newcomers from Mexico and Central and South America were placing what they saw as unsustainable pressure on the state’s police and public service agencies.

Bush’s opponents were right about one thing: The state was experiencing profound demographic shifts. In 2005, the United States Census Bureau announced that Texas’ ‘‘minority’’ population was no longer in the minority; it had reached an estimated 50.2 percent, largely because of the Hispanic population boom, making Texas the nation’s newest ‘‘majority minority’’ state (joining Hawaii, New Mexico and California). By 2011, the Texas minority population had passed 55 percent, and census figures showed that the Anglos making up the Republican base were much older than Hispanics were, and that Hispanics were reproducing at greater rates than Anglos were — both in Texas and nationwide. And yet, in national elections, Republicans were getting a shrinking piece of a growing pie. Mitt Romney’s 27 percent share of the Hispanic vote in 2012 was the third-worst performance since 1980.

By 2013, Republican party leaders in Washington and their corporate donors eager for laws legalizing the undocumented work force — in other words, the Establishment — were openly worrying that the party’s future was in grave doubt without more robust support from Hispanics. They urged their candidates to reach out to Latino voters ahead of the 2014 and 2016 elections. ‘‘If your tone isn’t welcoming and inclusive,’’ the party chairman, Reince Priebus, wrote in National Review, ‘‘you’re doing it wrong.’’ But in red states like Texas, Arizona, Alabama and Georgia, Republicans were going in the opposite direction, with get-tough messages that included promises to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants or to repeal laws granting them in-state tuition. In his failed comeback bid, Representative Bob Barr of Georgia warned that the Obama administration was secretly planning to ship ‘‘busloads of illegals’’ into the state. In Texas, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, referred to undocumented immigration as ‘‘an invasion’’ that he would work hard to stop. Patrick won in a landslide.

The newly charged atmosphere was especially evident in towns like Pasadena, where on a community message board one resident lamented ‘‘all of the damn Mexican flags flying around there,’’ even as you could still see a few Confederate flags waving from the homes of Anglo holdouts on the increasingly Hispanic north side. In 2007 the city found itself at the center of the national debate when a local Anglo, Joe Horn, shot and killed two undocumented immigrants he caught burglarizing his next-door neighbor’s house. After a grand jury cleared Horn of wrongdoing, the conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck celebrated him at a boisterous Tea Party rally outside the Alamo.

4. ‘It’s hard to make them obey the law’

Mayor Johnny Isbell of Pasadena has silver hair with streaks of auburn and the walk of a man who is packing heat, as he has been known to do. He has spent 75 of his 77 years in Pasadena, 22 of them as mayor. In November, he was sitting in his office inside Pasadena’s City Hall in a rocker by his propane fireplace, flames hissing, a framed copy of the Texas Declaration of Independence hanging on the wall behind him. Pasadena is no different from any other American city, Isbell told me. ‘‘It’s part of America today,’’ he said. ‘‘All cities have a lot more Hispanics in them.’’

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

During his lifetime, he has seen Pasadena’s population grow to 150,000 from 3,500. He was trying to be a mayor of ‘‘one Pasadena,’’ he said, Hispanic and Anglo, north and south. But politics were getting in the way, he said, and it ‘‘seems to be worse now.’’ Isbell grew up on the north side but moved south many years ago. Now he was dealing with an emboldened group of Hispanic lawmakers — Ornaldo Ybarra, Sammy Casados and Cody Ray Wheeler — who had teamed up with an Anglo councilwoman, Pat Van Houte, to demand answers about the disparity between north and south, between Hispanics and Anglos.

Isbell wondered aloud whether his council opponents just didn’t understand the way the city worked. ‘‘They’re talking about pouring sidewalks and fixing streets — it’s just not informed,’’ Isbell said, frowning. ‘‘So it’s a matter of maybe better educating them.’’ The plantings along Fairmont were a way to draw more customers, which was a way to boost sales tax revenue. ‘‘Women are going to shop where they feel safe and where it looks nice,’’ he said.

Ybarra and the other Democratic rivals saw it differently. The at-large council seats were just a way for Isbell to hang on to power and help old friends with pointless projects, like an effort to bring back the long-defunct Gilley’s nightclub, the honky-tonk setting for the 1980 John Travolta movie ‘‘Urban Cowboy.’’ ‘‘These people are so stuck on when they first got elected,’’ Ybarra said. ‘‘The city has changed.’’ But Isbell said his decision to change the city’s charter came from his long-held belief that at-large seats are better for the city. ‘‘The citizens are better served by having more than one person they can go to,’’ he told me, leaning forward in his rocker. ‘‘I’ve always believed that.’’

Isbell was on the City Council in 1992 when the previous mayor, John Ray Harrison, his longtime Democratic nemesis with whom he frequently swapped the mayoralty, switched the city over to the smaller, representative districts after local Hispanics began a federal Voting Rights Act lawsuit. The suit asserted that the at-large system had kept the town’s Hispanics — then not quite 30 percent of the population — from electing a representative of their choice. Civil rights groups brought similar suits across the state, and across the country. Once the city enacted the change, it could not go back. Any changes made to increase minority political representation could not be undone under the federal oversight of Section 5.

But after the Supreme Court’s Shelby decision in 2013, Isbell could make his move. Because his new plan for the council required a charter change, he needed to put it up for a citywide vote. He financed a political action committee called Citizens for Positive Change from his own campaign coffers — filled with money from employees of engineering firms that his opponents accuse him of funneling too many contracts to — and it had as its treasurer Cary Bass, whose family business, Bass & Meineke, had a contract for city-vehicle maintenance. Opposing money came in from the Democrats and a liberal group called the Texas Organizing Project. At one council meeting, according to a report in The Pasadena Citizen, a Hispanic woman from the south side said that a councilman allied with Isbell, Steve Cote, had very frankly told her homeowners’ association, ‘‘If we don’t pass these propositions, our city will turn blue.’’

In March 2014, the mayor presented the council with a new set of maps. In reducing the number of individual districts to six from eight, Isbell’s new map had reconfigured two of the majority-Hispanic districts, represented by Van Houte and Ybarra, into one larger district. When it was her turn to speak, Van Houte, a retired state benefits administrator, began to argue that the plan was so discriminatory that it could run afoul of the Voting Rights Act even without Section 5 in place. When she had talked for some five minutes, the mayor tried to cut her off. (He had recently enacted a new Council ordinance, on a 5-4 vote, limiting each member’s speaking time to two minutes.) Then Isbell ordered police officers to escort the council member from the room. ‘‘Oh, I’ve removed three of them,’’ he told me. ‘‘It’s hard to make them obey the law. They’re still doing it, and I have to shut them down all the time.’’

5. The ‘nudge factor’

Isbell’s at-large proposal in Pasadena provides something of a primer: It shows how easy it is to adjust the precincts in which voters cast their ballots and thus determine the outcome of elections. At the statewide level, things get far more intricate, but the basic principles are the same.",REAL
A Training Ground for Untrained Artists,"Facebook’s acquisition is the latest but not nearly the most impressive of a recent series of market successes for Creative Growth, which was founded in Berkeley in 1974 and has since relocated to a former auto-repair shop in downtown Oakland. Creative Growth has capitalized on the surging interest for work by self-trained artists or, as The Wall Street Journal has put it, ‘‘artists who don’t know they’re artists’’: work that in less sensitive times has been referred to as outsider art, naïve art, Art Brut and art of the mentally ill. Such art has experienced a boom during the past 15 years. The work of the field’s most prominent figures — Henry Darger, William Edmondson, Martín Ramírez and Augustin Lesage — has sold in the mid- and high six figures by Christie’s and other auction houses in New York and Paris. The Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art have acquired work by these artists for their permanent collections.

A majority of the most famous self-taught artists are dead. In many cases, their work was not discovered until after their deaths. It has become difficult to find their art for sale, and what exists is expensive. Collectors and galleries, eager to satisfy the market’s demand, find themselves in an odd position. Typically dealers in search of new art stars comb M.F.A. programs and the studios of established masters. But where might they discover ‘‘artists who don’t know they’re artists’’? Increasingly, these dealers are swarming to this converted auto-repair shop in downtown Oakland.

Creative Growth was born in the garage of Florence Ludins-Katz, an artist and educator, and her husband, Elias Katz, a psychologist who had worked for years at the Sonoma State Home. The Katzes were alarmed by the mass closure of psychiatric hospitals in California, where half of all patients had been deinstitutionalized during the 1950s and 1960s. Shortly after Ronald Reagan assumed the governorship in 1967, he signed the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, which blocked involuntary hospitalization and resulted in most of the remaining patients being turned out. Few accommodations were made for them after release, leading to an exponential rise among the mentally ill in homelessness and imprisonment.

The Katzes decided to create a center for former state-hospital patients with developmental disabilities, primarily Down syndrome and autism. Their goals, as stated in their 1990 book, ‘‘Establishing the Creative Art Center for People With Disabilities,’’ included not only therapeutic support and vocational training but also ‘‘creation of work of the highest artistic merit.’’ They wrote: ‘‘Even though a human being may be handicapped or disabled, this does not change his need to fulfill himself to the greatest of his capacity.’’

This was not an altogether iconoclastic notion; arts and crafts were offered in many state facilities. What was novel at the time, though, was the Katzes’ insistence that Creative Growth sell artwork to the public. ‘‘The students gain by feeling their art is worthy of being bought and perhaps reproduced,’’ they wrote. ‘‘The Art Center takes pride in the recognition that the art of persons with disabilities is much sought after and has value to society.’’

In 1978, after moving the studio to a storefront in Oakland and receiving a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Katzes opened an adjacent gallery, the first in America dedicated to art by people with disabilities. In 1982, Creative Growth expanded further to a 12,000-square-foot, two-story brick automobile-repair shop on 24th Street. The main open space is occupied by long worktables visible from the sidewalk through a row of large plate-glass windows. There are discrete work areas for drawing and painting, woodworking, printmaking, ceramics, rug making, textiles and mosaics. Teachers assist but are under orders never to guide or instruct, unless asked to do so by an artist. Next door, connected to the studio, is the gallery, which holds seven exhibitions a year. For decades these openings were mainly attended by families and friends of the clients, and occasionally local professional artists, who might buy a painting or sculpture for a nominal price. They had the quality of a local flea market or open mike.

This began to change in the late 1980s, when the work of Dwight Mackintosh, who came to Creative Growth after spending 56 years in mental institutions, was noticed by John MacGregor, a Bay Area art historian. MacGregor was a popularizer of Art Brut, the term coined by the artist Jean Dubuffet to describe work created in solitude by untrained artists. At the time, Dubuffet’s Collection of Art Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland, founded in 1976, was the world’s only such museum; after learning of Mackintosh’s work from MacGregor, the museum gave the artist a one-man show. The few American gallerists who collected outsider art, like Phyllis Kind in New York and Judy Saslow in Chicago, began to buy Mackintosh’s drawings. A Warner Brothers executive noticed his work in Michael Stipe’s personal collection and commissioned the artist to illustrate a Lollapalooza concert poster. The sudden critical and economic success caught Creative Growth’s board by surprise. They knew how to sell work to members of the local community but were unprepared for Manhattan gallerists, rock stars and international dealers.

Collectors began to visit the studio regularly, and work by other Creative Growth clients started to appear in group shows devoted to artists with disabilities. But it was not until 1999, when art critics began to praise the unusual, intricate sculptures of Judith Scott, a deaf and mute artist with Down syndrome, that Creative Growth’s board decided to change its mission. There was major interest in Scott’s work; there might also, it seemed, be a major market for it. If the professional art world was going to come to Creative Growth, the center needed to handle itself more professionally. It needed someone who understood the art market. It needed someone who knew how to sell.

Tom di Maria, who has been the director of Creative Growth since 2000, toured the studio at 9:30, greeting the artists as they entered the studio. Roughly 160 artists work at Creative Growth, but not everybody attends each day. Some, like William Tyler, have come every day for decades; others visit infrequently. Most are introduced to Creative Growth by the Regional Center of the East Bay, a nonprofit organization contracted by the state to provide services to people with developmental disabilities. Applicants do not need to express any artistic ability, inclination or even interest.

Di Maria often invites visitors to the gallery, and on this day he hosted an art collector and his wife, an interior designer, visiting from Santa Monica. The designer introduced herself to an artist named Monica Valentine. When the designer went to shake Valentine’s hand, she realized that Valentine was blind. Her eyes are prosthetics.

‘‘Can you see a little bit?’’ the interior designer asked.

‘‘I’m totally blind.’’

Valentine was dressed entirely in green: mint sneakers, lime socks, olive shirt, dusky green puffy jacket, emerald glass stud earrings, neon plastic sunglasses and a headband made out of interweaved strands of harlequin and laurel fabric. Around her neck hung, from chartreuse nylon, a green bicycle reflector.

Valentine covers foam packing forms with sequins and beads, held in place by sewing pins. The current piece was shaped like a cinder block. She called it ‘‘A Piece of Cake.’’ She hoped to be finished in time for her 60th birthday later that week. Before Valentine on the table were three plastic boxes, each with a half-dozen compartments. One box contained sequins, another beads, the third pins. With the dexterity of a veteran crocheter, she selected a pin, stuck it through a bead and a sequin and punched it into the foam. When a work is completed, the whiteness of the foam is almost entirely obscured beneath bright fields of color. Creative Growth’s gallery guide describes Valentine’s densely sparkling creations as ‘‘crown jewels of a lost disco civilization.’’

‘‘How can you tell the difference between colors?’’ the interior designer asked.

‘‘I feel them,’’ Valentine said.

‘‘Like ... they have different temperatures?’’

‘‘Blue is cold,’’ Valentine said. ‘‘Yellow is warm. Green is cool.’’

‘‘It’s so incredible that you can feel that. Because people who have eyesight can’t — ’’

‘‘Do you ride bicycles where you live?’’ Valentine asked.

The designer paused. ‘‘Where I live it’s really hilly, so I don’t,’’ she said. ‘‘I’m not strong enough.’’

Valentine showed the visitor her reflector necklace. ‘‘Do you like the reflector? What does it remind you of? Grass?’’

After the couple from Santa Monica left, Valentine called over one of the staff members, Kathleen Henderson.

‘‘What things are green, Kathleen? Can balloons be green?’’

‘‘Sure they can.’’

‘‘Can cars be green?’’

‘‘Yes, Monica. Cars can be green.’’

‘‘Kathleen?’’

‘‘Yes, Monica?’’

‘‘What things are red?’’

‘‘When the opportunity exists,’’ the Katzes wrote, ‘‘we have seen the creative impulse burst forth like a surge of floodwater when the dam has been removed. We have seen people cry when viewing their own work. We have seen the joy in their faces. ... We have seen, and we believe.’’

There is no better example of a dam being removed and a creative impulse bursting forth than the case of Judith Scott, who was brought to Creative Growth in 1987 by her fraternal twin sister, Joyce. The sisters were born outside of Cincinnati in 1943 and were reunited in California after 40 years apart. Judith never learned to speak, having lost her hearing in infancy from scarlet fever. Her deafness went undiagnosed for decades, so she never learned to speak or sign. Her muteness was attributed to low I.Q. Doctors advised the Scotts to institutionalize Judith and cease all contact. When the sisters were 7, their parents took Judith in the middle of the night from the bed she shared with Joyce and left her at the Columbus State Institution. Joyce, violating her mother’s wishes, visited the institution as an adult and found her sister distraught, living in near total isolation. When Judith showed an interest in creating art, her crayons were confiscated. According to Joyce, Judith was declared ‘‘too retarded to draw.’’

During her first two years at Creative Growth, Judith Scott appeared unengaged, occasionally making drawings but more often sitting blankly, or napping, at her worktable. It was not until she was placed in a textile course taught by the artist Sylvia Seventy that she began to wrap. She roamed through the center’s storeroom, gathering objects — a broom, a broken chair, a tissue box, bamboo slats — that she wrapped in twine, thread and yarn. The first sculpture she completed looked like two small human figures tied together. ‘‘I understood,’’ Joyce writes, in a forthcoming book about her sister, ‘‘that she, too, knew us as twins, together; two bodies joined as one. I wept.’’

Scott’s sculptures grew more elaborate with time. They attracted the attention of MacGregor, the art historian, who made her the subject of a 1999 monograph, ‘‘Metamorphosis.’’ The next year Creative Growth decided to hire di Maria as its new executive director. His chief duty would be to promote Scott’s work. Board members told di Maria that they thought her work might be important but didn’t know what to do with it.

They also explained that they now wanted their clients to be thought of not as artists with disabilities but as ‘‘contemporary artists.’’ Di Maria, who previously worked as assistant director of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, didn’t have to be convinced. He was immediately taken by the merit of the work being produced at Creative Growth, he said. The center, he felt, also offered an escape from the pretensions of the art world. ‘‘It was pure,’’ he says. ‘‘I don’t mean to fetishize that word, but it’s true. They are using their work as a means to communicate.’’

Shortly after di Maria was hired, he received a visit from Lucienne Peiry, the director of Lausanne’s Collection of Art Brut, which had given Dwight Mackintosh his first major show. Peiry wanted to determine whether Scott fit Dubuffet’s definition of an outsider artist. After observing her closely for several days, Peiry concluded that, though Scott worked in a studio with other artists, she did not respond to them — preserving the sense of isolation and imperviousness to influence that was crucial to Dubuffet. Peiry made Scott the subject of a 2001 show, which later traveled to New York, Hong Kong and Tokyo.

With Joyce Scott’s blessing, di Maria increased the price of her sculptures from $200 apiece to $5,000, putting it in line with sculpture by other emerging contemporary artists who had appeared in a museum show. When the pieces sold quickly, he increased the price to $15,000. (Creative Growth, like most professional galleries, splits every sale evenly with the artist.) Scott’s work was the subject of a 2002 show at the Exploratorium in San Francisco and was featured at the Outsider Art Fairs in New York and Paris. Judith Scott’s heart gave out in 2005 while on a weekend retreat with her sister; she died in Joyce’s arms. Di Maria was never certain whether she understood that her work was being sold or even exhibited.

‘‘I was with her at two or three exhibitions of her work,’’ di Maria said. ‘‘She wasn’t so interested. If she’d see one of her sculptures, she would do this thing where she’d kind of pat it on the head, as if it were her little kid. She was interested when people came to the studio and watched her work. She would shake hands. I feel that she knew that people were paying increasing attention to her. I don’t know if she made the connection to the sculpture.’’

As William Tyler worked on a drawing, a touring group from a center for people with traumatic brain injuries paused to observe him. Tyler’s method is patient, glacial, precise. He pauses often to think, his head resting in his hand in a dreamy pose. He draws in black marker on white paper, creating ordered landscapes and portraits, many of them depicting him and his brother, Richard. The brothers worked at Creative Growth together until seven years ago, when, according to staff members, it was discovered that Richard was abusing William. They have not seen each other since, but in William’s drawings, Richard continues to appear as a smiling, beatific presence.

Tyler’s canvases are often dominated by lines of neat text, framed in black boxes, that reflect his obsessions: geography, crime news, dates and times, his fear of swimming, his love of magic. A storefront occupied the bottom left corner of his work in progress, beside a series of flags of his own invention. The rest of the canvas was taken up with text:

Tyler is a dedicated watcher of television news. In the news that week was the mass murder at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., as well as a shooting during the victory parade for the Golden State Warriors’ N.B.A. championship.

‘‘You heard about the nice people in Charleston, South Carolina?’’ he asked me. ‘‘Man shot them. He’s a bad man. They put him in jail. Things happen for a reason.’’

I asked where he got his news.

‘‘Channel 11 news,’’ Tyler said. ‘‘Channel 7 news. Channel 71 news. Channel 72 news. Channel 75 news. CNN. Fox News. Weather.’’

Tyler spoke about a trip he took with his brother to Hawaii. It was financed by money earned from his artwork. ‘‘Eight-day vacation,’’ he said. ‘‘Me and Richard went in 1988. We went to the National Memorial Cemetery. Pearl Harbor Museum. We had lunch at the pineapple field. I drank pineapple juice. At Hawaii Island we had pancakes with butter and banana syrup. We took Aloha Airlines to the Big Island, Hawaii. Ate lunch on the airplane.’’

Tyler said that he was born on April 23, 1954, a Friday. He said that he grew up in Berkeley and lives in Union City. ‘‘Don’t get lost on this planet Earth,’’ he said. ‘‘Things happen for a reason.’’

Writing 20 years ago in The New York Review of Books, the British critic Rosemary Dinnage described the allure of outsider art as ‘‘the fantasy that over there, on the other side of the insanity barrier, is a freedom and passion and color that were renounced in childhood.’’ Underlying 20th-century art, wrote Dinnage, was ‘‘the longing for a return to something direct and strong and primitive.’’ You can see this longing in the art of Paul Gauguin, Alberto Giacometti, Marcel Duchamp and André Breton — artists influenced by the work of indigenous tribes, children and patients of mental asylums. Max Ernst assembled a 1919 exhibition in Cologne, Germany, in which Dadaist work was set beside art by the clinically insane. The African tribal sculptures at the Musée d’Ethnographie du Trocadéro in Paris fascinated Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse and led to transformations in their style. Paul Klee declared children, mental patients and North African tribesmen his artistic idols. ‘‘Neither childish behavior nor madness are insulting words,’’ he wrote. ‘‘All this is to be taken very seriously, more seriously than art of the public galleries, when it comes to reforming today’s art.’’ When the trappings of artistic fashion have come to be seen as restrictive, artists have sought the work of those ignorant of fashion.

Jean Dubuffet’s ‘‘Art Brut’’ designation was not an embrace of self-taught art so much as a rejection of its appropriation by conventional artists. Inspired by the Heidelberg psychiatrist Hanz Prinzhorn’s 1922 book, ‘‘Artistry of the Mentally Ill,’’ Dubuffet formulated a set of criteria to distinguish artwork made by society’s outsiders from work derivative of it: A true outsider artist had to work in total isolation, impervious to influence and unmotivated by any hunger for fame, status or profit. Over time Dubuffet saw reason to expand his criteria, however, and today no definition of ‘‘outsider art’’ withstands scrutiny; the two art worlds, outsider and insider, increasingly tend to bleed into each other. Even so, the fantasy of the notion of purity persists. It does more than persist. It sells.

The recent bull market for self-taught art has coincided with di Maria’s directorship of Creative Growth. Whether di Maria saw this market change coming or helped to bring it about, he understood that Creative Growth was poised to benefit from it. But first he had to establish the integrity of all the artists under his care — not just Judith Scott. He realized, as soon as he was made director, that major things would have to change. The studio space, for instance: After 18 years, it still looked like an auto-repair shop. ‘‘If the building doesn’t seem contemporary, the artists won’t seem contemporary,’’ he informed the board of trustees, shortly after he began. He began a $1.8 million fund-raising campaign and in 2008 hired the architect Anne Fougeron to create a more contemporary design, emphasizing natural light and clean lines. The gallery, which previously resembled an overstuffed attic, with unframed artwork covering every inch of the walls, was painted white. Exhibited works were framed and hung professionally, surrounded by plenty of blank space, as in a Chelsea gallery.

The center had long been staffed by local art teachers, but state budget cuts in 2010 terminated that program. Given the opportunity to hire a new staff, di Maria selected exclusively professional artists and art administrators. ‘‘From me to the bookkeeper, we all went to art school,’’ he said. ‘‘No one has a social-services background or a psychiatric background. This is an important part of our philosophy: Artists should work with artists.’’

The final step was to gain prestigious institutional support for Creative Growth’s artists. As Scott’s work grew in renown, di Maria donated sculptures to the American Folk Art Museum, the Milwaukee Art Museum and the Collection of Art Brut, forming relationships that would benefit his other artists. He organized a widely attended conference in Oakland and pursued partnerships with collectors and galleries, like Matthew Higgs’s White Columns, which regularly includes Creative Growth artists in its exhibitions. In 2008 Creative Growth even opened a gallery in Paris, Galerie Impaire, to sell work more easily to European collectors. Di Maria also continued to raise prices. ‘‘In the contemporary art world,’’ he says, ‘‘if a work is priced too low, certain collectors won’t buy it. They assume that price is a signifier of value.’’ He learned that at his first Outsider Art Fair. The pieces on sale for $50 went unsold. Those priced at $1,000 sold out.

More recently Creative Growth entered a phase that di Maria refers to as ‘‘the Hollywood stuff.’’ The center collaborated with Marc Jacobs and Paper Magazine. Cindy Sherman and David Byrne hosted fund-­raisers. T-shirts designed by Creative Growth artists have been modeled by Scarlett Johansson, Drew Barrymore and the Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Michelle Vawer. The Museum of Modern Art, after acquiring work by Scott for its permanent collection, has purchased paintings by Dan Miller and William Scott, who paints idealized portraits of African-­American leaders, San Francisco and women from his church. This year Judith Scott was the subject of a major exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum. Her sculptures have now sold for as much as $45,000, and di Maria has declined offers more than three times as high.

It is not advertised, but the Creative Growth studio is open to the public. Most visitors who ask permission are allowed to observe the artists, and many of the artists welcome visitors. One recent afternoon, two white-haired collectors watched John Martin as he drew a tractor with a black Sharpie. Martin is tall and solidly built, with large hands and a friendly smile. On the table beside him, a small boombox played Ice Cube’s ‘‘It Was a Good Day.’’

‘‘Do you have a tractor like this?’’ Martin asked the couple.

The woman, supporting herself on a cane, pointed at Martin and whispered his name to her husband.

‘‘You can buy this tape,’’ Martin said, gesturing to his boombox. ‘‘You can put it in your car. I can’t tell you where you can get the tape.’’

He drew a man on the tractor, wearing a backward cap. He said it was Ice Cube.

‘‘I like his music,’’ Martin said. ‘‘I saw him on the TV set. I don’t have enough money for this man’s record.’’

Martin opened a Chinese magazine written entirely in Mandarin. It contained features on technology, business and culture. The elderly couple scrutinized his every movement, as if observing a living artwork.

‘‘It’s a book on Chinese food,’’ Martin said. ‘‘Let me see what they got on sale.’’

He flipped the pages. There were photographs of men giving speeches.

‘‘Where’s this restaurant? This says it’s in Chinatown. Let me see how much it costs.’’ He continued flipping until he came to images of food; a restaurant review, perhaps. ‘‘Stir-fried shrimp, $10,’’ Martin said. ‘‘I think they got shrimp, red lobster, stir-fried fish. Chicken chow mein. Meatballs, pasta, rice. Tomato sauce.’’

He returned to his drawing. He drew a single letter on each of Ice Cube’s teeth, copying the letters from a subscription form that had fallen out of Flash Art magazine. The letters were ‘‘v,’’ ‘‘d,’’ ‘‘w’’ and ‘‘f.’’ I asked what the letters stood for.

‘‘Music,’’ Martin said.

Visitors to Creative Growth, whether professional artists, collectors or curious passers-by, are invariably astonished by the amount of high-quality work being produced. ‘‘The best work made here is absolutely no different from the best work made anywhere,’’ says Lawrence Rinder, the director of the Berkeley Art Museum and the Pacific Film Archive. ‘‘I was the dean of an art school for four years. If we had the same percentage of success, we’d be the best art school in all of history.’’

What accounts for this unusual rate of success? Rinder credits ‘‘the character of these studios and the methodology that somehow inspires creativity at a consistent and high level.’’ The center does offer ideal working conditions. Stephen Beal, president of the California College of the Arts and former board president of Creative Growth, also cites them: ‘‘The flexibility they have, how they support an artist’s evolving way of working, who sits where, all those small things contribute to the quality that comes out of there. Maybe you’d get similar kinds of things out of everybody if you supported them that way.’’

Would you? Would you have the same results if you offered a Creative Growth residency to the next 160 people who walked down 24th Street? Creative Growth’s clients are not preselected for artistic talent. Many have never tried to make art before. Might it be possible that the work’s originality has something to do with the fact that those creating it have led unusual lives, under unusual pressures, which have caused them to view the world in unusual ways?

The question yields uneasy responses. Rinder rejects the idea forcefully. ‘‘Both instinctively and intellectually I try to separate that out.’’ Di Maria, however, acknowledges that a connection exists. ‘‘The culture of disability informs the voice of the work,’’ he says. ‘‘I’ll be in Japan, working with artists with Down syndrome, or I’ll be in Finland, working with artists on the autistic spectrum, and I’ll see similarities in style or form to artists with similar disabilities in other cultures. So maybe that’s its own culture, too.’’

Yet Creative Growth and its supporters tend to minimize the artists’ disabilities wherever possible. When asked to describe the center’s artists, di Maria even resists ‘‘self-trained artists.’’ ‘‘Work that doesn’t relate or respond to art history,’’ he says, ‘‘that’s how I describe what our artists do.’’ Di Maria routinely turns down invitations for exhibitions that emphasize the disabilities through artist photographs or biographical statements. Nor does Creative Growth participate in exhibitions that carry the label ‘‘Outsider Art,’’ with the notable exception of the annual Outsider Art Fair in New York, the field’s most prominent showcase. An extreme example of this approach was a recent show at the Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco, ‘‘The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,’’ which included no wall labels whatsoever. It was only by reading an informational pamphlet, available by request, that visitors could determine that some of the artists were from Creative Growth.

The effacement of biographical information avoids the danger of aestheticizing the disability or exploiting the disability to sell the work. But it also contravenes a dominant trend in the contemporary art scene. The artist’s biography and artist’s statement have become major marketing tools. Strong narratives sell. And Creative Growth artists tend to have profound, heartbreaking stories. Nearly every review of Judith Scott’s art, whether in The New Yorker or Artforum, leads with her life story. Di Maria is therefore put in the awkward situation of trying to de-emphasize the artist’s disability while recognizing that, for many collectors and critics, the disability is central to the work’s appeal.

Dan Miller was spending the afternoon in an action-painting class, in which the artists stood in front of upright canvases. Miller’s paintings are composed of words written on top of one another, creating dizzying palimpsests that bear some resemblance to Cy Twombly’s scrawled glyphs. He wrote the word ‘‘Grainger’’ in blank acrylic across the canvas. His uncle owned a Grainger hardware store. Words like ‘‘socket,’’ ‘‘pineboard’’ and ‘‘electrician’’ recur in his paintings.

‘‘You have character,’’ the instructor said. ‘‘That’s what’s great about your drawings. I can always tell it’s you. You have a signature style.’’

Over the black words, now a smudged nimbus, Miller painted, in green, ‘‘Home.’’

‘‘Home?’’ the instructor asked.

‘‘Home Depot,’’ Miller said.

When he finished a canvas, which took about 20 minutes, he chanted the word ‘‘paper’’ until the instructor brought him a new canvas, at which point Miller immediately began again.

Downstairs, Peter Salsman, an amiable former racecar driver who bears some resemblance to Kurt Vonnegut, was showing slides of his flowerpots on his iPad. The ceramic pots are decorated with irises, passionflowers and roses.

Salsman’s voice lowered. ‘‘I’m one of God’s angels,’’ he said. ‘‘I’ve been dead three times. I go to work at nighttime for God. I put people in the right place.’’

He paused.

‘‘God calls on me when I’m sleeping. If someone dies, I have to go collect them. Like when Classie passed away here, I went and picked her up in my ’55 Chevy.’’

Salsman pressed one hand to his temple.

‘‘I really take them to heaven and to hell. I have to go wherever I’m sent. It’s a lot of responsibility. Too much.’’

Miller appeared on the other side of the studio, accompanied by a staff member.

‘‘Costs a lot of money, right?’’ Miller said.

‘‘Yes,’’ she said. ‘‘It costs a lot of money.’’

‘‘Costs a lot of money, right?’’

‘‘Yes, Danny, it does.’’

Though some artists at Creative Growth do not understand that their work is sold at all, many know exactly how much their work is selling, or not selling. This introduces a new motivation into the studio. One artist mentioned that he had begun to paint trees because they were selling well. Another, disappointed by the quality of her ceramic sculptures, recommitted herself after she sold one. A third was so discouraged when her paintings didn’t sell that she gave up the medium. John Martin lies somewhere in the middle. He looks forward to the first of the month, when he receives his check for art sales, and complains about being broke. But the physical check itself means nothing to him. ‘‘What am I supposed to do with this?’’ he says. Sometimes he tears the check up.

What does the money do to the artists? The romantic view of a self-trained artist is one whose work, like Henry Darger’s, is not discovered until after his death. But when artists understand that their work is being appraised and sold in a marketplace, is such an arrangement still ‘‘pure’’? Does the artist’s awareness of the market compromise the value of the art itself?

To answer the question, you must first decide whether people with disabilities deserve special treatment — whether they should be shielded from the anxieties, frustrations and injustices of adult life. Disability theorists tend to agree that this sheltering impulse, while well intentioned, is a form of infantilization that denies its subjects’ humanity. The awareness of an art market that judges your work, subjectively and perhaps unfairly, can only cloud the motivations that lead Creative Growth artists to do the work they do. It leads to greed, disappointment and envy; also to affirmation, encouragement and pride. It leads, in other words, to life.

‘‘When you see a Creative Growth artist at an opening, they’re beaming because they’re accepted,’’ Beal says. ‘‘If you didn’t have that, would the engagement be as focused and sustained as it is?’’

Every artist receives a quarterly check from a common pot funded by sales of Creative Growth T-shirts and other items, an effort to counter money anxieties and to create the sense that all art has value. But some checks are bigger than others.

‘‘Money changes everything,’’ di Maria says. ‘‘But it’s also not my choice. It’s the artists’ choice, and I would never make decisions for them. If some of them want to enter the market and sign with commercial galleries or rent their own studio, it’s not my job to stand in the way. It may be that Creative Growth was a nice 40-year experiment and, in the future, it won’t need to continue.’’

It was the opening night of a new Creative Growth exhibition, ‘‘Parting Is Such Sorrow Until We Meet Again Tomorrow.’’ Included were elegiac portraits of Classie; paintings of trains and buses and bridges; a bright drawing in Prismacolor pencils by George Wilson of a crowd waving to a departing cruise ship; and several of John Martin’s flip-phone sculptures, made of wood.

Several artists had been asked to stay later than usual so that they could discuss their work. In exchange, they received envelopes containing $25. The attendees — among them professional artists, Berkeley art historians and wealthy collectors from San Mateo County in matching pastel outfits — inspected the work and chatted with di Maria. Occasionally a patron approached one of the artists (‘‘Show me which of these are yours.’’ ‘‘How did you get the idea to do that?’’), but most of the time the artists stood around uncertainly. Wilson, whether out of excitement or agitation or joy, began dancing to the music in the middle of the floor. It was a swaying, jittery kind of dance, like hula-hooping without the hoop.

Finally, it was too much. Wilson shot through the crowd, out of the gallery and into the darkened studio. A staff member followed him. Wilson sat at the nearest worktable and waited. The staffer retrieved Wilson’s current work in progress and his Prismacolor pencils and set them before him. For the next two hours, while in the adjacent room the music played, glasses of wine were poured and patrons discussed the art and the artists, Wilson drew.",REAL
Who’s Really ‘Radical’?,"The terms ‘‘radical Christian’’ and ‘‘radical Jew’’ have little purchase, not because there aren’t people who commit violence in the name of Christianity or Judaism but because they don’t loom large in the public consciousness and threaten to swallow a religion’s whole identity. Robert Dear, suspected of killing three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs in November, was an ‘‘extremely evangelistic’’ Christian, according to his ex-wife. Online, he wrote about Jesus. Scott Roeder, who in 2009 killed Dr. George Tiller, an abortion provider in Kansas, testified at his trial about his conversion to Christianity and said that his faith and his views about abortion went ‘‘hand in hand.’’ Yet most Americans would not equate anti-abortion violence with radical Christianity. We assume that these men are outliers — not exemplars.

The same assumptions, in the West at this moment, are not accorded Muslims. ‘‘It puts the onus on Muslims to prove they are not one of them,’’ Jamal J. Elias, a professor of religious and South Asian studies at the University of Pennsylvania, told me over the phone. For Trump, the use of ‘‘radical’’ is a kind of entry point for blatant discrimination. We are ‘‘at war with radical Islam,’’ he said earlier this month — defending his call to bar all Muslims abroad from entering the United States.

The use of ‘‘radical’’ has played out similarly in other moments of American history. In 1919, when he was 24, J. Edgar Hoover earned a promotion at the Department of Justice to head a new unit called the Radical Division. ‘‘It was a time of deep concern over radical revolutionaries and terrorists supposedly pouring into the country from Italy, Russia and Eastern Europe, who also often happened to come from Catholic and Jewish backgrounds,’’ says Beverly Gage, a Yale historian who is writing a biography of Hoover. In April and June 1919, two nationwide bomb plots targeted dozens of prominent businessmen and politicians, including Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. In response, Hoover helped engineer the Palmer raids, arresting several thousand people, most of them immigrants who belonged to anarchist and Communist groups. Congress followed by passing stringent immigration restrictions based on national origin.

And yet ‘‘radical’’ has also been a term of honor rather than contempt. If you see an urgent need for change, you may decide that reform — working within the system — will serve only to prop it up. The left, in particular, has often embraced that view over the last century. Opposing the Vietnam War in 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. called for the nation ‘‘to undergo a radical revolution of values.’’ It was the country’s most dissent-filled decade, when feminists, labor organizers, environmentalists and student groups also unabashedly agitated for significant change. They looked to American history for intellectual forebears. ‘‘Many of the radicals of the ’60s tried to resuscitate an American tradition of resistance from the bottom up and giving voice to the powerless,’’ the New York University historian Thomas Sugrue told me. ‘‘They went back as far as the early Republic, to validate their critique and to defend grass-roots participatory democracy as essential.’’ For years, the historian Eric Foner has taught a course at Columbia University called the Radical Tradition in America. Two of his former teaching assistants, Timothy McCarthy and John McMillian, edited a 2003 collection, ‘‘The Radical Reader,’’ which opens with American revolutionaries like Thomas Paine and moves to utopians like Walt Whitman, abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and suffragists like Sojourner Truth.

The 1960s radicals who advocated armed self-defense, like the Black Panthers, or turned to violence, like the Weathermen, also laid claim to deep American roots. In 1969, the Weathermen blew up a statue in Chicago built to honor the police who died during the Haymarket affair in 1886, in which the police dispersed a peaceful labor demonstration, and someone in the crowd threw a bomb. ‘‘The statue commemorated the oppression of radicalism,’’ Gage says. ‘‘By blowing it up, the Weathermen commemorated the anarchists. They were very self-conscious about that.’’

Blowing up the system is generally less appealing to conservatives, who tend to defend the status quo. But there are exceptions to that rule. ‘‘Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,’’ Barry Goldwater said when he accepted the Republican nomination as their party’s presidential candidate in 1964. At the time, he was the hero of a newly identified ‘‘radical right,’’ epitomized by the John Birch Society, a conspiratorial anti-Communist and anti-civil-rights group with chapters throughout the nation. Mainstream conservatives set out to marginalize the Birch Society as an irresponsible fringe element. Radicals, after all, are the members of a group who push its limits and either end up leading or getting pushed out. Today Republicans in the House of Representatives who call themselves the Freedom Caucus and unseated the House speaker John Boehner last fall are nurturing the spirit of radical rebellion on the right.

In a sense, ‘‘radical’’ is a protean word, Sugrue points out, with more meanings and possibilities than we can track. But one common thread that ties radicals together is their scorn for authority outside their own movement. On the inside, the experience of radicalization is a conversion to be celebrated, when false trappings appear to fall away and a deeper truth emerges. But what if the radicals are too full of their own self-certainty? That’s the danger inherent in the definition. Then, like Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, they turn into walking sticks of dynamite.",REAL
Must I Pretend to Like My Artist Friend’s Work?,"Her present employer hired someone new about a year ago who is 15 years younger than my wife chronologically and even younger emotionally. Her sexual boundaries with clients are at times inappropriate. My wife and I are good people, and given what this person has told us about her life, we’ve tried to mentor her a little. She’s clingy, emotional and doesn’t respond well to pressure; my wife has had not just to coach her but also to help her complete her work on time. We both feel fortunate to have been supported early in life, and wish to give back. I even polished her résumé.

This person found out about the same position my wife wanted and applied. Another co-worker who used to work with them and now works at the second office also viewed this person as a train wreck but elected not to speak up, figuring she was so much weaker than my wife and would be found out anyway.

The boss preferred my wife, but is perhaps overly concerned about collegiality in his office, so when other workers spoke up in favor of this other woman (whom they knew socially), he honored their wishes. In fact, he trusts his colleagues so much that between the friends’ raving and the former co-worker’s not saying anything, he apparently neglected to conduct any background or reference checks before offering the job to this other woman. It’s a travesty.

Still, my wife and I are content to let karma find this woman. The boss has since been given more complete details and is likely to be aware of his mistake. My wife wouldn’t take the job now anyway.

Here’s the dilemma for me: In coming in to work and blabbering about her many one-night stands, etc., this woman also shared that she was fired from a previous job for snooping around in patient records and has since been overheard covering up for a similar ‘‘accidental’’ click on private patient material in her current job. This new service works with a major sports team in the area; sexualizing and snooping seem inevitable. In looking over her résumé again this evening, I found many errors and lies. Injustice to my beloved aside, I now feel this woman should not be working in health care at all, which would never have happened if she told the truth or if her prospective (not to mention current) employer had done his or her due diligence. Is blowing the whistle on her the ethical thing to do, even aside from the injustice and betrayal to my wife? Name Withheld

The boss’s decision here strikes me as irresponsible. If you’re hiring someone who will have access to confidential information, you have a duty to check up on her properly. The fact that someone is pals with people who work for you is no reason to skip a proper review. Pals aren’t the best source of information about someone’s previous job performance, and a supervisor who allows his employees to push him into hiring a friend in the name of ‘‘collegiality’’ isn’t taking his role seriously. There’s a more general problem with hiring in this way. Filling jobs through social networks like these is, in itself, a major source of unfairness in our society. Highly talented people without connections are overlooked when this happens. When you have someone with an inside track, you have an especially strong reason to take a serious comparative look at the outside candidates. Otherwise we’re not taking seriously our commitment to meritocracy.

On your account, the decision here was not just procedurally flawed; it also had an unfortunate outcome. If this woman has not changed her ways — and her chattering about her previous abuses of confidentiality suggests neither embarrassment nor remorse — she may indeed breach the privacy of the clients at her new place of work. You speak of karma. Are you basically saying you’re going to leave the boss to find out the hard way that he or she has made a mistake? While that will no doubt cause problems for him and for his new employee, the largest problems will be visited on innocent third parties.

I’d leave things there if you hadn’t made it clear that your motives are mixed. You’re upset that your wife was treated unfairly and didn’t get this job she really wanted — and for which, let’s stipulate, she was better qualified. Then there’s the ingratitude factor: The vibe here is somewhere between ‘‘All About Eve’’ and ‘‘Showgirls.’’ So naturally you wouldn’t mind seeing the person who beat her out for the job getting booted from the profession. You reassure yourself with the thought that your wife wouldn’t take this job now — that you’re not advancing your wife at someone else’s expense. But you both knew this woman’s weaknesses when she was a co-worker. You responded by mentoring her and helping polish her résumé. If she shouldn’t be in health care, why didn’t you do anything about it before now?

Your feelings may have distorted your view of the situation. But now you’re reporting objective facts — her C.V. is inaccurate; she was once fired for snooping in files — that her boss can evaluate and might have found out on his own if he had done his job. The real question here is whether someone whose motives are uncharitable is the right person to pass on the information. Ideally, people do what’s right because it’s right. Schadenfreude may be Germany’s most successful export, but it has never been a particularly noble sentiment. Still, if nobody else speaks up, it may fall on you to do so. Just try not to take the wrong kind of pleasure in it.

I have a question regarding things that don’t seem to belong to anybody. I live in an apartment that has been inhabited over the years by students at the local university, and since I’m now in my mid-20s, I’m looking to finally move on. I’ve become somewhat attached, however, to several kitchen items and a piece of furniture that were among the many things left in the apartment when I moved in. Is it ethical to take these items with me, or do they belong to the apartment? Name Withheld

Ah, the things students leave behind. The sky-blue pleather beanbag chair. The toaster oven with the expressive dent. The baking sheet with scorch marks that trace Christ’s countenance, miraculously resistant to scrubbing. I can imagine the temptations, but I fear such articles belong to the apartment. The landlord has the right to let you take them, though. So ask, and you may receive.",REAL
Rebuilding the Middle Class the Army Way,"Photo

A few weeks ago, I was sitting in a classroom at the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pa. There were 16 students, all in their early 40s and most of them lieutenant colonels, who had been selected to spend a year in this rural, peaceful place learning how to think strategically about war. In modern business, ‘‘thinking strategically’’ has become a cliché entirely devoid of meaning. But in the military, its meaning remains quite precise. As one person in the class told me, as a lieutenant colonel in a tank battalion, he was engaged in tactics: making sure that his tankers and their tanks were ready to fight. As a colonel, he would be concerned with strategy: advising on which enemies those tanks should engage and how.

For the first time in their careers, these officers were being taught to think broadly, with readings that included everything from military theory to philosophy. The professor, Stephen Gerras, who holds a Ph.D. in industrial and organizational psychology and is a retired colonel himself, created an open, almost subversive atmosphere in the class. (To enable this openness, I agreed to some ground rules: I wouldn’t name any of the students in the class or quote the specific things said.) It was thrilling to witness — all these people exploring, publicly, thoughts that felt dangerous to them. It reminded me of first-­year college students, except these were middle-­aged people who had commanded thousands of soldiers in battle.

The divide between strategy and tactics — between people who design the plans of war and those who implement them — is as old as organized armies. Interestingly, as laid out in what may be the single most important book of American business history, Alfred Chandler’s ‘‘The Visible Hand,’’ this military model was copied a century ago as the model for the hierarchical American corporation. In particular, these organizations borrowed the delineation between executives tasked with strategy — the corporate equivalent of colonels and generals — and tactical workers (enlisted soldiers) and midlevel managers, who played the role of captains, majors and lieutenant colonels.

But then came global trade, computers and the Internet, and we learned that the military-­inspired corporate hierarchy didn’t work so well when information needed to flow far more quickly throughout an organization and decisions had to be made with haste. Many of the structural economic challenges we face today can be explained by the decline of this organizational form. Uber, Airbnb and Google are examples of new corporate forms that scramble the roles of managers and managed, strategy and tactics. There has been a continuous onslaught, over the last 40 years, on the midlevel managers Chandler once applauded. They have been replaced by email and Excel and outsourcing. Even many traditional-­seeming companies brag about their flatter, leaner, less-­hierarchical style. It would be hard to find any business-­school professor or corporate executive preaching the blessings of bureaucracy.

These shifts may make business sense, but they come at a cost. Put simply: The disappearance of middle management is a central part of the disappearance of the middle class. Without large corporations that have a place for people at many levels of skill and ability and a reasonably clear path of promotion, tens of millions of Americans are left underemployed and underpaid. For much of the 20th century, companies would employ young people with few skills and invest in them, knowing that they would most likely be paid back over the employees’ long tenure. Today, the United States military is one of the few employers in America that still makes this kind of investment in a demographically broad group of people. If we wanted to find a 21st-­century form of organization that can help rebuild the middle class, we would need it to retain at least a little something from the institution most responsible for building the American middle class in the first place.",REAL

Do you think that there’s something about cats that demands a more touchy-feely approach? I’m not religious, but I firmly have roots in the spirit world, and I’m consistently learning from cats what lies beyond the tangible. They’re completely in touch with that.

When you say cats are in touch with what lies beyond the tangible, what are you talking about? We are surrounded by energy, we are mostly made up of energy and cats are so attuned to that. You’ve probably seen your cat stare at a spot on the wall, just stare at it.

Yes. My cats do this sometimes. If you’re totally, overly human about it, you’re going to be like: dumb cat. Right? What I think is that they are locked into an energy pattern in that corner of your room. And they are observing and taking it in. If you allow yourself to see that, it makes perfect sense.

This is distinct from the online conspiracy theory that cats were sent to spy on us by aliens? Yes. One of the things I always end up talking about on my book tour is the way the press perpetuates the demonization of cats. They take these studies and exaggerate their claims. There was this story recently that said your cat would eat you if it could.

I think my cats would eat me if they could. If there was no other food, and they were starving. They would, totally, but that just makes them ecologically efficient.

What do you think of the theory that cats take their owners to be large, strange, hairless cats? That’s silly. Any time you start a sentence with ‘‘Cats think,’’ you’re going to be wrong.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Joke Dollar,"Photo

Around 10 years ago, on an evening about town, a friend of mine made a remarkable offhand joke about a sexual encounter with a mermaid. It was too crude to reproduce here, and anyway, I’ve learned not to try. It’s never as funny as it was that night. During the collapse that followed, I summoned just enough motor control to hand her a dollar. Clearly, I figured, she had done work: She surveyed the market, applied her expertise and delivered — on deadline no less. A buck seemed like the least I could do.

Later that evening, one of our friends made an even funnier joke than the one about the mermaid. The original recipient of my dollar stood up, fished in her pocket and gave it to him. It was a pleasing callback, and she presented it to much howling and drumming on the table. This practice became known among my friends as ‘‘joke dollar.’’

That is my earliest memory of it, but it’s apparently not how joke dollar began. No one knows how joke dollar began. Its origins are cloaked in mystery, specifically the sort of mystery that attends on heavy drinking. If not a thing as old as time, joke dollar is a thing as old as 2006, when we all started doing it in New York. My childhood friends from Iowa generally believe I brought it back to the city from grad school in Montana. My grad-school friends think it came from Iowa.

Whatever its origins, joke dollar has persisted thanks to its simplicity: When someone makes a very funny joke — the kind that triggers a tsunami of laughter that obliterates conversation and fetches everyone up, breathless, in a moment of perspective on life itself — you give that person a dollar. Joke dollar is not for prepared material. It is for the bon mot, the right remark at the right time, which is why so few joke-dollar anecdotes are funny in print. You had to be there. The joke dollar pays for the privilege of having been there, in a small increment that makes it no less pleasing a transaction. It confers the dignity of American capitalism on the act of hanging out.

Treasures for under a dollar on eBay: ‘‘Ghostbusters 2’’ trading card from 1989. Soviet Union stamp from 1964. Bright-pink toilet-shaped pencil sharpener. ‘‘Super Milk Flavor’’ Thai gummy candies. ‘‘Ants,’’ the anteater Beanie Baby.

American capitalism is gross, of course, and therein lies the joke dollar’s symbolic appeal. Awarding it properly is an act of bathos: the sudden descent from the sublime in human experience to the ridiculous. The pettiness of the dollar emphasizes the value of the joke. By introducing a profane unit of monetary exchange, the joke dollar draws attention to the way such shared moments are sacred, literally priceless. This conversation is more valuable to me than a bottle of water, it says. That joke was better than a digital download of a song. For one dollar, I would rather have this moment with you than a lottery ticket.

Like the regular dollar, the joke dollar derives its worth from limited supply. It is important to keep only one joke dollar in circulation at a time, to prevent joke inflation. If you keep handing out more joke dollars, the pressure to award them will mount, until every ‘‘that’s what she said’’ costs you a buck. Worse than the expense, this scenario so floods the market that your friends will try to win joke dollars by getting your attention rather than by constructing wit. Strictly limiting the number of joke dollars to one avoids moral hazard. Its real purpose is to encourage not wit but the appreciation of wit in others.",REAL
A New Winter Roast,"Photo

We were eating dinner at Houseman, a restaurant opened by the chef Ned Baldwin on the once-quiet far-western side of SoHo, now called Hudson Square. It is a spare, welcoming room, with walls of white brick, warm lighting, smooth wooden tables the color of Bridgehampton sand — a neighborhood restaurant for those who live amid art and commerce, who travel widely, who want to eat simply and well.

There was succulent roast chicken in front of us, and a confitted turkey leg accompanied by bacon and prunes and a slab of grilled bread, a shatteringly crisp fist of fried haddock, a few fingers of juicy sausage. There was a plate of roasted carrots with cottage cheese and pumpkin seeds. There were soft, perfect leeks with fried cauliflower, anchovies and bread crumbs that caught the light from the flickering votive candles on the table. This all made for superb eating.

There was, too, a small platter of roasted red kabocha squash slashed with a thick, dark dressing of fresh parsley and cilantro, the sour and inviting taste of sumac cut with lime and vinegar, dots of salty feta, bits of pistachio, the sweet bite of currants. It was astonishing in its simplicity, a salad to delight the senses. You could make it for a dinner party and receive accolades, or eat it monthly with family and develop the sense that your cooking is getting better, more adventurous, while somehow becoming easier to perform as well.

Simplicity of this sort is rarely simple to achieve. It asks for a triangulation of sweet, salty and sour. It punishes excess. It demands exactitude.

Or so I thought. ‘‘It is not that hard,’’ Adam Baumgart said quietly. Baumgart runs the kitchen at Houseman alongside Baldwin, and the recipe is his. We talked about it that night at the front of the kitchen, and later over email and the telephone, as I ran through his instructions at home, making the dish for civilians.

‘‘The key is a good, ripe, squash,’’ Baumgart said. He buys them by the case and stores them in the restaurant’s basement for up to a month, allowing them to sweeten in their skins. ‘‘It’s not like they’re going to go bad,’’ he said. ‘‘They’re only going to get better.’’",REAL
Judge John Hodgman on Helicoptering Your Parents’ Babysitting,"Photo

Dan writes: My partner thinks we should leave our 15-month-old son alone with my parents overnight. But I have witnessed some alarming behavior when they have taken care of my nephew. Once, rather than use the formula powder my sister-in-law had left them, my mom went into a random cabinet and used pancake mix instead.

It’s a tough call. On one hand, your son’s a little old for formula. On the other, he’s getting to be just the right age for pounding raw pancake batter. But still, that’s a weird, hard mistake to make. So while I normally trust grandparental experience over new-parental paranoia, I agree with you. Have a talk with your mom about her moments of confusion, over coffee. Unless she serves you a mug of ants, I bet you’ll be reassured.",REAL
How to Eulogize Someone You’ve Never Met,"Photo

‘‘All people have a story,’’ Chris Ponnet says. ‘‘It’s your job to find it.’’ For more than a decade, Ponnet, the director of spiritual care at the Los Angeles County­-U.S.C. Medical Center, one of the largest public hospitals in the country, has been leading the annual memorial service for many hundreds of people who die in Los Angeles County whose remains go unclaimed. He eulogizes immigrants, homeless people, AIDS patients, young men killed in gang shootouts, sometimes babies who die before being named.

If possible, a eulogy should include enough particulars to sketch the arc of someone’s life. Begin with what Ponnet calls ‘‘spiritual detective work.’’ Find out if the deceased was religious, and respect those beliefs in your commemoration. Ponnet is a Catholic priest; he uses an iPhone app called Interfaith Care for the Ill to quickly look up background information about other religions and readings from them. Choose inclusive language. ‘‘Memorials are not for preaching or converting,’’ says Ponnet, who favors terms like ‘‘Creator’’ or ‘‘Loving One’’ over creed-specific references like ‘‘Jesus.’’

Approach each life as a historian: Look for primary sources like written statements or end-of-life plans. Gather stories from family members and friends of the dead, but don’t approach the most distraught. Find a calm relative and ask open-ended questions; others will usually join in answering. Prompt them to recall fond memories, not grievances. ‘‘Try to get details like, ‘Joe went to Vietnam, came back and worked as a carpenter,’ ’’ Ponnet says.

When someone dies without friends or family, Ponnet pulls together a few tidbits of biography from their personal effects — a military ID card, faded photographs of children. ‘‘We tend to put our most important items in our wallets,’’ he says. If you lack for things to say, consider reading from one of the classic funeral service texts, like Psalm 23 or the Serenity Prayer.

State at the outset that you did not know the deceased. People can tell if you didn’t, Ponnet says. Keep your remarks short, between five and seven minutes. Write down the essential information ahead of time. (‘‘Does this person go by Liz? Elizabeth? Betsy?’’) Leave 10 seconds at the end for silent reflection, and then close on a bright, alive note. A man who dies a lonely addict might have loved horses as a child. ‘‘A person’s last moment,’’ Ponnet says, ‘‘doesn’t summarize their whole life.’’",REAL
The Identity Thief,"‘‘You aren’t a refugee,’’ I said. ‘‘You aren’t from Syria.’’

‘‘It’s all the same by now, brother,’’ he said in perfect Turkish. ‘‘It’s one country.’’

Listening to his script, I started to grit my teeth. These con artists take advantage of war and turn it into job security.

‘‘You’re lying, and your passport is fake,’’ I insisted. Syrian passports are as hot as guns right now. When the rebels take over a Syrian city, they control the passport and immigration centers, the equipment, everything. They confiscate real passports and sell them on the black market too.

People started to gather to see two men arguing in both Arabic and Turkish. Now the woman started pacing and looking around. She looked so nervous. ‘‘Screw you, for calling me a fake,’’ the man said, clenching his fists. He was getting really aggressive. There are people here called tinerci, ‘‘the people of the glue,’’ who sniff glue and walk around the square high as hell. At any moment, they’re ready to flip out, stab you, whatever.

Sensing a threat, my best friend stepped in between us. I’m kind of a big guy, but I’m not stupid enough to punch a stranger with nothing to lose. And yet I was simmering with rage because I had been judged as a fake myself earlier that very day.

I had gone to the United States Embassy to apply for a visa. I sat in a massive waiting room with my passport and an invitation from an American nonprofit to participate in an art event in Houston. When No. 36 appeared on the screen, my wife and I approached the clerk’s window. He looked at the papers. I assumed he was happily checking off boxes in his head, because he didn’t say anything.

When the clerk got to my passport, he kind of smirked. He told me in a deadpan voice that he couldn’t give me a visa because I was Syrian and there was war in my country. He said I might have fabricated the invitation to find asylum in America.

I thought he was joking; it was such an over-the-top reason to deny me. We smiled. I thought the clerk was going to chuckle and say: ‘‘Thank you, we’ll get your visa ready. Have a good trip.’’

But no, his fingers did a ballet across the computer keyboard, and then he pushed my passport back under the slot, as if it were a spent candy wrapper. Silence. I couldn’t believe it. This clerk thought I was lying. Go beg, he might as well have said, that’s where you belong.

Everyone waiting stared as we left. I had paid a few hundred dollars to be totally offended. I felt worthless. So I had zero patience for impostors, you see?

Back in the square, my friend nudged me away. ‘‘Look, they are everywhere,’’ he said. There were many panhandlers with their belongings spread out on the ground. Some were running up to cars, pressing their passports to the windows. ‘‘You cannot change the world.’’

Pointing to the passport, I said to the beggar: ‘‘Please stop using that, it’s not yours.’’ His family probably was poor. Yet it was shameful for him to use these symbols of innocence and chaos — his swaddled infant and my country — this way.

My friend and I continued walking under the cloudless blue sky. Enough, I said. And then I asked him for my first cigarette in a year.",REAL
The 12.6.15 Issue,"Photo

RE: WHITE DEBT

Eula Biss wrote a treatise reckoning with what is owed — and what can never be paid — in our multiracial society.

I am a white American human rights activist with a long history of fighting racism, and the only thing I missed in Eula Biss’s profound meditation was a little more reflection on what she calls the ‘‘lie ... that there is any such thing as a Caucasian race.’’ If whiteness is truly a lie, then doesn’t elevating it to a ‘‘moral problem’’ reinforce the very privileges and permanency associated with it that Biss seeks to disrupt?

I am not suggesting that whites who recognize that we have ‘‘our’’ cake should happily go on eating it. I am saying that neither supremacism nor egalitarianism is an inherently racial attribute any more than whiteness or blackness is per se a ‘‘moral problem.’’ I think even Nietzsche would agree that morality ultimately rests more on what we do than on who we think we are. By that standard, Eula Biss, as a white person publicly denouncing the ‘‘original fraud’’ of white privilege, may actually be less guilty and more liberated than she thinks. Dorothy Q. Thomas, Amagansett, N.Y.

Photo

Reading Ms. Biss’s article without any prior experience in society would have the reader imagining a dystopia wherein whites and their proprietary police force ruthlessly and persistently oppress minorities for the sake of enforcing a bizarre stratification of some nebulous privilege. As with seemingly every post-post-modern societal think piece, it entirely overlooks the moral agency not just of individual police officers but of individual white people. Her take on society is mildly interesting but ultimately shaky in its insistence that whites, the large majority of whose ancestors did not own slaves or even live in America during the time of slavery, take personal responsibility for actions they had no control over, either. D.P., Alameda, Calif.

Eula Bliss wrote a wonderful article about how racial injustice has not only benefited whites but also deeply affected their conscience. The strong, mostly negative, responses to her piece in the comments section are a representation of how whites have been strongly encouraged, as she says, ‘‘to agree, against all evidence, that a system that afforded [them] better housing, better education, better work and better pay than other people was inherently fair.’’ R.

The Art of Flying in the Movies,"The camerawork is similarly primitive and ingenious. No fast cuts, no dollies or cranes to mimic and counterpoint the movement of the objects within the frame. The little window in your laptop screen opens on a charmingly and almost absurdly simpler time, a collection of antique moments that is also a foreshadowing of the present.

We live in the grip of a technological paradox, in which the proliferation of wonders dilutes the possibility of wonder. This has partly to do with marketing and mass consumption, with the democratization of the special and the rare. More of us can now see more of the world than ever, whether literally, through travel, or virtually, through images. Some of the mystery, the frisson of discovery, is lost because of that.

And yet the domain of astonishment has been extended, its earlier manifestations lovingly preserved. Movies can introduce us to feelings that have no literal correlative, and they can induce those feelings again and again. Orville and Wilbur Wright may have built what was in effect a flying bicycle, but the only way we know what it’s like to ride one is through the mediation of film. When E.T. and Elliott achieve liftoff and pedal into the sky, the effect is transporting and strangely moving. You know how it goes: Your stomach drops and your heartbeat accelerates. Children cheer. Adults burst into tears. It’s scary and inexplicable.

Dorothy Gale’s house, lifted out of the Kansas prairie by a twister, encounters Almira Gulch on the prototype of Elliot’s bike. Then, through a clever, easy editing trick, she’s the witch on her broomstick. ‘‘The Wizard of Oz’’ is full of images of flight that are both terrifying and sublime. The wicked witch’s monkeys are like fighter squadrons darkening the sky. Glinda’s bubble and Oz’s balloons are emblems of serenity and optimism. The whole movie is a trip from the ordinary to the magical and back.

It’s a journey undertaken by every generation, via Mary Poppins’s umbrella, Superman’s cape, an updated mythical dragon or those jetpacks we still believe are waiting for us out there in the science-fiction future. The tools that produce this illusion have changed. Watching ‘‘The Wizard of Oz’’ now, you can tell that Dorothy’s house spinning through the cyclone is a miniature, and that the twister Ms. Gulch pedals through is made of back-projected clouds and wisps of smoke-machine fog. You might glimpse, or at least infer, the wires and harnesses aiding E.T. and Mary Poppins. You may even, through DVD commentary or your own geekish tendencies, know a thing or two about process shots and green-screen compositions and three-dimensional computer modeling. You can break down the trick and see how it’s done. The arrival of computer-assisted special effects and the revival of 3-D have made flight simulation on-screen newly attractive, both commercially and aesthetically. At a time of small-screen ascendancy, there has to be something to quicken the pulses of moviegoers — and that something, more often than not, is the defiance of gravity. Just look at the spacewalks in ‘‘Gravity,’’ ‘‘Interstellar’’ and ‘‘The Martian.’’

Did you see ‘‘Furious 7’’? Not technically a flight picture, but an automotive movie that extends the highway into the clouds. Do you remember when the cars parachuted out of the belly of the transport plane and hit the mountain running at full speed? Or when the red sports coupe — was Vin Diesel driving? Michelle Rodriguez? — went zooming around inside the big glass tower in Abu Dhabi and then smashed through the window and sailed over to the other tower and kept going? Oh, man! Pure adrenaline. And pure slapstick sublimity. How did they do that? How did they even think of it?

The fun, however, has always cast a shadow. The ‘‘Furious 7’’ skyscraper sequence, thrilling though it is, can’t help evoking the Sept. 11 attacks. An instant cliché after the planes hit the twin towers was ‘‘It was like something out of a movie.’’ In the years since, movies have fought to reclaim the imagination of disaster as their special purview and to restore the innocent anarchy of impact, velocity and flight. We want the thrill without the danger. But the danger is there, alongside the liberation. These machines — airplanes and movie cameras — bring terror along with wonder.

Barely a decade after Kitty Hawk, aviation shed its innocence and became an instrument of war. ‘‘We dared to hope we had invented something that would bring lasting peace to the earth,’’ Orville Wright would reflect near the end of his life. ‘‘But we were wrong.’’ While air power was not as decisive or destructive in World War I as it would become in subsequent conflicts, the Great War engendered new images of combat, images that would feed the blossoming and ravenous art of cinema. Fighter pilots flying in formation were like celestial cavalrymen, and their engagements could be imagined as an updated version of hand-to-hand fighting — a test of courage, dexterity and cunning.",REAL
Editor’s Letter: Take Flight With Virtual Reality,"V.R. is something new for us, and we’re still learning all the uses to which it can be put. Last month, with the Nov. 8 issue of The Times, we distributed roughly a million Google Cardboard virtual-reality viewers to our home-delivery subscribers; we launched a new app, NYT VR, that turns your smartphone into a virtual-reality player; and we released the magazine’s first V.R. film, ‘‘The Displaced,’’ which took viewers inside the lives of three children who have been displaced in the global refugee crisis.

In its first week, NYT VR had the most successful app launch ever at The New York Times. Throughout the weekend, and in the days since, the #nytvr hashtag on Instagram has been filling up with photos of people of all ages with our cardboard V.R. viewers stuck on their faces (some of those photos are shown here). Comments on Twitter ranged from ‘‘OMG THE FUTURE’’ to ‘‘Blew my grand­parents’ minds.’’

Since then, The New York Times has deployed V.R. on one other project, an immersive dispatch from the streets of Paris in the aftermath of the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks. There’s no doubt that V.R. is uniquely suited to projects like these, in which viewers are plunged into a dramatic situation and allowed to connect with subjects whose life experiences are far from their own. But we also believe that, as with any good storytelling tool — indeed, as with cinema itself — V.R. is well suited to a range of subject matter. It is not only an ‘‘empathy machine,’’ as many have said, but also a vehicle for enchantment.

‘‘Take Flight’’ is a short film that lifts you up into a strange and beguiling night-sky tableau directed by the filmmaker Daniel Askill. (The film was co-produced by Vrse.works and RadicalMedia.) It is as different from ‘‘The Displaced’’ as ‘‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens’’ is from ‘‘Restrepo.’’ ‘‘The Displaced’’ was shot entirely on location with a V.R. camera rig; it is a work of documentary filmmaking. ‘‘Take Flight’’ is more akin to a short feature, complete with special effects. To create it, we shot our actors separately in the studio, stitched them together in postproduction and added a considerable amount of C.G.I. voodoo to create the night sky, the clouds, the moon, the stars. It is a fantastical concoction, a spectacle made of smoke and mirrors. And as such, a fitting tribute to the glorious illusions of Hollywood movies.",REAL
Behind the Scenes of ‘Take Flight’,"Some might imagine that all the magic happens in postproduction these days, but so much of it is actually done on the set. For several of our short films, special-effects technicians strapped the actors into harnesses and worked these rigs in three-person teams, pulling them to and fro, almost like marionettes. Even from that perch, the actors had to do an incredible amount of work to complete the illusion: to convincingly look weightless or airborne, even when they were strung up somewhere in Los Angeles. I had no idea just how physically demanding the work is. It’s not easy to fly.",REAL
"Trudeau’s Canada, Again","In person, Trudeau was as upbeat and friendly — as nice — as might be expected of a politician with a campaign mantra of ‘‘Sunny Ways,’’ a reference to the optimistic adage of Wilfrid Laurier, a Liberal prime minister at the turn of the 20th century. Trudeau is 6-foot-2 and has an athletic build, his hair neatly trimmed after years experimenting with a variety of shaggy manes. There was little of the pomp of the powerful — just an aide named Tommy, who brought him half a tuna sandwich and a cup of chicken-noodle soup for lunch from the cafeteria downstairs. This was the first print interview Trudeau had granted since taking office, and in his presence there was a palpable sense that he was still figuring out exactly how to play this new role — how to talk, how to gesture, how to adopt the mien of a world leader. Despite his studied manner, he was prone to providing glimpses of his unguarded self.

‘‘It’s very, very cool to have the president call up, and I say, ‘Hello, Mr. President.’ I’ve never met him,’’ Trudeau said. He dropped his voice an octave to imitate President Obama: ‘‘Justin, I like to think of myself as a young politician. The gray hair caught up with me, and it’ll catch up with you. But calling me ‘Sir’ makes me feel old. Call me ‘Barack.’ ’’

Trudeau shook his head, amazed. ‘‘That’s going to take some getting used to.’’

One week later, a new geopolitical relationship between America and Canada would begin in a conference room in Manila at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, when Trudeau and Obama sat down for the first time to talk. In an age of a rising China, Middle Eastern chaos and Russian belligerence, it may sound strange to say, but the United States has no relationship more important than the one with Canada. The country is one of America’s largest trading partners (on par with China), a peaceful neighbor and a crucial ally in global affairs — when the relationship is functional, as it hasn’t been in recent years. Harper’s hawkish foreign policy put him at odds with Obama on the Iran nuclear treaty, Israeli-Palestinian relations and Syrian refugees. In domestic affairs, Harper was strongly in favor of the Keystone XL pipeline, which Obama resisted; the president killed the project two weeks after the Conservatives lost. The discord may largely have ended with Trudeau’s election, though Canada will be less likely to participate in airstrikes against ISIS in the Middle East.

The 45-minute session in Manila was casual and friendly; two of Obama’s campaign aides worked for Trudeau’s campaign, and the president followed the Canadian race and knew of the excitement the victory had generated around the world — much as his own triumph had in 2008.

In a private conversation, the president advised Trudeau to be active early, but also to think about calibrating sky-high expectations with a long-term plan for governance. Obama shared his impressions of various world leaders, suggesting whom to build relationships with — and whom to steer clear of. Obama issued an invitation to Washington, and later to a state dinner to be held in the new year, the first honoring a Canadian prime minister in 19 years. The president went out of his way to make clear that he looked forward to spending personal time together, with their wives. ‘‘There was an air of mentorship but not in a paternalistic way,’’ Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, said. ‘‘Trudeau’s going to be on the stage for a long time. He’s got a ton of talent.’’

‘‘It was nice to confirm in person how like-minded we are on so many issues,’’ Trudeau told me. ‘‘He said that seeing my family on TV on election night reminded him of his election in 2008 with his family. I’m looking forward to having a beer with him.’’

The election this fall was nothing less than an existential struggle over what it means to be Canadian. On one side, there was Harper’s vision of a nation in an age of terror, in a world afire with conflict. On the other was Trudeau’s moderate liberal belief that the world is not riven by an epic clash of civilizations, and that cultural and religious and linguistic differences and openness are Canada’s strength.

What the world knows as a progressive modern Canada was created largely under the rule of the Liberal leader Lester Pearson and then Pierre Trudeau in the ’60s and ’70s, when the country began to sever its ties with Britain and assert its own identity. The country created a new flag, replacing the Union Jack with the Maple Leaf, and adopted a national anthem. Quintessential Canadian characteristics — universal medical care, bilingualism, multiculturalism, a strong voice for peace and development at the United Nations — were born during that era. The earliest major political initiative of Pierre Trudeau in the late ’60s was to decriminalize homosexuality. ‘‘The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation,’’ he said. In rapid succession, Trudeau legalized abortion, funded the arts and promoted a race-blind immigration policy, which over time would transform the great cities of the country into polyglot metropolises.

Defeating the son of Pierre Trudeau would have been a metaphysical vindication for Harper. For the past decade, Harper did all he could to undo the legacy of the older Trudeau, internationally, domestically and symbolically. In defense of ‘‘old stock’’ white Canada, Harper denigrated the United Nations, made the modest attire of Muslim women a political issue and recast Canada’s role in the world as part of a grand alliance to defend Western civilization. Harper freely admitted to loathing the older Trudeau, despite an adolescent fascination, writing ungraciously after his death in 2000 about meeting him for the first time in the streets of Montreal. ‘‘There I came face to face with a living legend, someone who had provoked both the loves and hatreds of my political passion, all in the form of a tired-out, little old man.’’ Harper’s greatest ambition was to destroy Trudeau’s vision of the country: ‘‘He continues to define the myths that guide the Canadian psyche, but myths they are.’’

Slide Show

As a Canadian expat living in America, I became acutely aware of the election’s symbolic importance in September, when the body of a little Syrian refugee boy washed up on the shores of Turkey. The child had relations in Canada who tried to help the family immigrate, but Harper had maintained a hard line on Syrian refugees, claiming national secur­ity was more important than the humanitarian crisis, and the family was forced to try to escape the war by sea. After the boy’s death, Harper’s government continued to inveigh against Muslim ‘‘jihadi’’ immigration in a way that struck me and many others as astoundingly un-Canadian, at least in a historical sense. But the nation’s self-image was precisely what the Conservatives were determined to remake.

For a decade, Harper remained in office through a mix of artful politics, successful economic management and falling crime rates — as well as inept opposition. During that era’s elections, the more progressive vote split between the Liberals and the New Democrats, a party to the left of the Liberals, allowing Harper to retain the prime ministry. During most of the recent campaign, Trudeau’s Liberal Party was running third behind the Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party. But after the death of the Syrian boy and Trudeau’s strong performance in five contentious debates, voters began to abandon the New Democrats, coalescing around Trudeau in the hope of defeating the prime minister.

‘‘People decided to line up behind whoever was going to beat Stephen Harper,’’ Trudeau told me. ‘‘I was of the mind that even if there was uncertainty about my own personal ability to run the economy, there was the feeling that the party had a team and history that meant we’d get the compromises and balances you have to make. So I could take much bigger risks to challenge the orthodoxy.’’

While campaigning, Harper portrayed Trudeau as the feckless, high-taxing son of the former prime minister, a novice whose surname was his sole qualification for high office. One of many areas of confrontation during televised debates was a law Harper proposed that would have allowed the government to revoke citizenship for Canadians with dual nationality if they were found guilty of terrorism — in effect making Canadians born in another country a separate class of citizen.

‘‘Why would we not revoke the citizenship of people convicted of terrorist offenses against this country?’’ Harper asked Trudeau incredulously.

‘‘A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian,’’ Trudeau replied defiantly. ‘‘And you devalue the citizenship of every Canadian in this place and in this country when you break down and make it conditional for anyone.’’

Conservatives countered that Trudeau was naïve, rejecting Canada’s role in the war on terror and instead emphasizing soft-minded issues like global warming. ‘‘The focus on climate change as the ‘top threat,’ while important, is also code for isolationism and an unwillingness to deal with the Islamic State and terrorism in general,’’ said Christopher Alexander, former minister for citizenship and immigration in the Harper government. Alexander remains convinced the country has made a large, potentially tragic mistake in electing Trudeau. ‘‘There was a strong thread of nostalgia in the Liberal campaign for a simpler time, for a more peaceful world and the nostrums of Trudeau’s father when Canada didn’t have to deal with global terror threats,’’ he said.

Harper’s defeat at the hands of Pierre Trudeau’s son had obvious dramatic dimensions of the classical Greek variety, redeeming not just the family name but also Pierre’s view of the nation. The younger Trudeau has appointed a cabinet from a wide sweep of ethnic groups and made a point of choosing equal numbers of men and women. Virtually every Trudeau initiative, from tax policy to an embrace of the L.G.B.T.Q. community to relations with China, seemed a rebuke to the previous administration. Government scientists, who had been effectively prevented from talking to the press lest they contradict Harper’s skeptical view of climate change, now shared their research with reporters in tones of relieved amazement. Even Trudeau’s simple act of answering questions from journalists in Parliament’s press theater — a space like the White House’s briefing room — took on myriad meanings. Harper hadn’t held such a news conference in six years.

‘‘It’s a whole new world,’’ a reporter muttered as Trudeau approached the lectern. ‘‘I don’t know what to do with myself.’’

No political figure provokes stronger feelings in Canada than Pierre Trudeau. Depending on whom you ask, he was either the personification of a sophisticated and ambitious Canada or a socialist wastrel libertine. Pierre’s father made a fortune in gas stations, netting $1.2 million in 1932, which freed his son from the need to work — just as Justin never had to make a living. As a young man, Pierre traveled to Africa and Asia, studied at Harvard and the London School of Economics and socialized with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in Paris.

During his time as prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984, the Montreal-born boulevardier was despised in western Canada for an energy policy that enriched the eastern provinces. He was also hated by separatists in Quebec, who saw him as a quisling for Anglo elitists. Yet in many ways he was a visionary. At the time, Canada’s Constitution could be changed only with the approval of Britain’s Parliament, a colonial vestige. In 1982, this provision was done away with, and Trudeau in effect became a Canadian founding father. An intellectual who approached issues with an analytical and a creative mind, he fashioned a constitutional legal landscape midway between America’s rights-based rules and the unwritten and informal British approach.

Trudeau gave his son a front seat to history. When he was a boy, Justin met Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan (who recited verses from the poem ‘‘The Shooting of Dan McGrew’’); Richard Nixon toasted the toddler in Ottawa, predicting he would become prime minister someday. But the younger Trudeau told me he never discussed the subject with his father until the last year of his life. ‘‘He was much more focused on having substantive conversations,’’ Trudeau said. ‘‘Politics didn’t fit into that for him.’’

The younger Trudeau has a bachelor’s degree from McGill University and a teaching degree from the University of British Columbia, but despite his pedigree and inherited wealth, when he reached adulthood his life was remarkably unremarkable. He traveled the world and smoked marijuana and snowboarded and worked as a bouncer at bars, eventually ending up teaching high school in Vancouver.

Justin Trudeau’s lack of qualifications to be prime minister were obvious, as was his lack of his father’s erudition — but he considers himself to have undergone his own peculiar kind of schooling. Trudeau points out that he has visited nearly 100 countries, many of them for international summit meetings with his father, which provided an intimate understanding of statecraft. Travel has also given him compassion for the less fortunate around the globe. In his memoir, ‘‘Common Ground,’’ Trudeau described a moment from a boyhood trip to Bangladesh, recollecting it in the kind of mawkish language his opponents ridicule but that is plainly heartfelt. On state business with his father in Dhaka, the younger Trudeau saw a poor old man with a bicycle wait patiently while their motorcade swept by. He was suddenly seized with empathy for the man, realizing that there were billions of people on earth, each a unique individual, each with a story. ‘‘I have never looked at my life and my circumstances in quite the same way since,’’ he wrote.

The drama of the Trudeau family has long played out in the Canadian imagination, much like that of the Kennedys in America. Justin Trudeau’s mother, Margaret, was 22 in 1971 when she married Pierre, then 51. He was the prime minister and a famous eligible bachelor; he was also a workaholic and a notorious skinflint. After giving birth to three boys in quick succession, the beauty dubbed ‘‘Maggie T.’’ by the press smoked marijuana while under the watch of Mounties, ate peyote before giving a speech in Venezuela and left her husband to party at Studio 54 in New York. The Trudeaus eventually divorced. According to Margaret’s own account, she had affairs with Teddy Kennedy, Ryan O’Neal and at least one Rolling Stone.

Despite the glamorous trappings, a central part of the Trudeau family story is rooted in tragedy, in the death of Justin’s younger brother Michel at the age of 23, in an avalanche on a backcountry ski trip in British Columbia in 1998. His death seemed to touch off a downward spiral in Pierre. A deeply religious man with a Jesuitical cast of mind, he began to doubt his faith. Michel’s death was also devastating for Margaret, and Justin tended to her. It was only later, after Margaret was committed to a mental institution, that she learned she had an undiagnosed case of bipolar disorder; she has turned the cause of mental health into her life’s work.

The death of Pierre Trudeau in 2000 marked the beginning of Justin Trudeau’s public life. As the eldest son, then 29, he was asked to give the final eulogy for one of the towering figures in Canada’s history. The state funeral in Montreal for the older Trudeau remains one of the most significant events in Canadian television history, and Justin was the unquestioned star, delivering an emotional remembrance with the touch of a natural orator. ‘‘Je t’aime, Papa,’’ he said, laying his head on the coffin in an instantly iconic gesture of national grief.

Justin Trudeau entered politics eight years later, running for Parliament in Papineau, a working-class, multiethnic district in Montreal. Trudeau distinguished himself with hard work and an appetite for retail politics; Trudeau’s father never loved pressing the flesh, but his son’s greatest talent might well be his common touch. When Trudeau won that year, in an upset, it was news — but of the celebrity and nostalgia variety.

The younger Trudeau’s road to victory as prime minister truly began on a Saturday night in 2012 in a boxing ring in Ottawa. At the time, the Liberal Party was leaderless and lost, after a devastating defeat in the election of 2011 reduced its seats in Parliament to only 34, roughly one-tenth of the total at the time. The sensible way forward seemed to be a merger with the larger New Democratic Party. Aiming to change the political dynamic, Trudeau literally picked a fight. In what looked like a publicity stunt, he challenged a 37-year-old Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, known as Brass Knuckles, to three rounds of boxing to raise money for cancer research.

Everyone expected Trudeau to receive a royal beating, including his wife. Brazeau had a black belt in karate and a military background, and he grew up on hardscrabble First Nations reservations; his bar brawler’s physique, tattoos and trash-talking bravado made him the three-to-one favorite by fight night.

That Saturday evening, the country tuned in to a conservative news channel to see Trudeau — ‘‘the shiny pony,’’ according to the right-wing political commentator who was calling the fight — stunned by roundhouse rights and haymaker lefts from Brazeau. But then something unexpected happened: Trudeau found his feet and worked his jab. The tough-guy senator was punched out, too tired to raise his arms. His face alternated among outrage, fear and bloody-nosed confusion as Trudeau beat him senseless. The bout was stopped in the third round, saving Brazeau the indignity of hitting the canvas.

The commentator recognized the importance of the victory. ‘‘I can hear it already,’’ he sighed. ‘‘Trudeau for leader.’’

Slipping through the streets of Ottawa on Nov. 10, six days after his swearing-in, I sat with Trudeau in a motorcade that was comically polite. His peloton of four black S.U.V.s stopped at lights, signaled respectfully, followed the speed limit and used no sirens or police escort. It was like a skit satirizing Canadian manners. We were headed to an arena packed with 16,000 youths gathered to celebrate a nonprofit called Free the Children. In a nice bit of political stagecraft, Trudeau had appointed himself minister of youth, inverting the significance of a post generally seen as marginal.

I asked the prime minister if the fight with Brass Knuckles Brazeau had been part of a larger plan — a piece of agitprop aimed at turning around his political fortunes, and with them the nation’s. Trudeau gazed out the window for a moment, contemplating, then turned to me and offered a clipped nod and a sly smile. He knew perfectly well the power of symbols and had intended to exploit that power.

‘‘I saw it that way a little bit,’’ he said, his voice betraying a distinct note of guile. ‘‘The fight was going to be a way of highlighting and surprising people with what I am. It wasn’t about proving anything to myself — other than perhaps as a reminder that I’m very good at sticking to and executing a plan. But it was a way of pointing out to people that you shouldn’t underestimate me — which people have a tendency to do.’’

Riding in a motorcade as he had as a boy, but never as the center of attention, Trudeau chose his words carefully. ‘‘There was a perception that I’d grown up with a silver spoon in my mouth,’’ he said. ‘‘I’d boxed for 20 years on and off, so I knew that the worst-case scenario was that I was going to take a brutal beating but stay standing until at least near the end. I was confident I could take a punch. I knew I had the stamina to last three rounds. People were saying that maybe he was still smoking while he was training. I was absolutely focused on my training. One thing people are starting to realize is that I work incredibly hard at everything I set my mind to.’’

One year later, the Liberal Party elected him leader, and two years after that, the country elected him prime minister. The scale of Trudeau’s underdog victory was stunning: With a comfortable majority of 184 seats in Parliament, and Liberals in seats spread across the country, he won an undeniable national mandate. As he has managed the transition from campaigning to governing, he has presented an ambitious agenda: funding infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy, supporting programs to reduce childhood poverty, investigating the disappearance and murder of more than 1,000 First Nations women, introducing a rigorous carbon-capture policy, legalizing marijuana. The Canadian system does not have the same checks and balances among branches that the American system does, so Trudeau can implement his policies without being stymied by right-wing opposition.

As an example of his thinking, Trudeau noted his decision to raise taxes on the top 1 percent of earners while lowering middle-class taxes, even as his government funds infrastructure improvements. He knew that Canada would run a deficit, which was unusual for a country known for fiscal probity, but he believed it was the way forward. ‘‘Confident countries are willing to invest in the future,’’ Trudeau said, ‘‘not always follow the conservative orthodoxy of balanced budgets at all costs.’’

In the face of the Syrian refugee crisis, Trudeau had pledged to bring 25,000 civilians fleeing war to Canada by the end of the year — a cry that rallied the nation in his honeymoon days. The shootings in Paris didn’t change this policy, but he has decided to slow the process to ensure it is orderly and safe. (By Jan. 1, 10,000 will be admitted.) But if the Paris or San Bernardino attacks had happened in Montreal or Winnipeg before the election, he may well have lost, an illustration of the fragility of democratic institutions in the age of terror. Trudeau said he wants Canada to be free from the politics of fear and division.

‘‘When a mosque was vandalized in a small rural community in Cold Lake, Alberta — which is as conservative as you can imagine in Canada, with the stereotypes around that — the entire town came out the next day to scrub the graffiti off the walls and help them fix the damage,’’ Trudeau told me. ‘‘Countries with a strong national identity — linguistic, religious or cultural — are finding it a challenge to effectively integrate people from different backgrounds. In France, there is still a typical citizen and an atypical citizen. Canada doesn’t have that dynamic.’’

Terrorist groups have specifically said they are targeting Canada and Canadians. And on the subject of national security, Trudeau’s critics say he’s a lightweight and a dangerous one. Trudeau’s most radical argument is that Canada is becoming a new kind of state, defined not by its European history but by the multiplicity of its identities from all over the world. His embrace of a pan-cultural heritage makes him an avatar of his father’s vision. ‘‘There is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada,’’ he claimed. ‘‘There are shared values — openness, respect, compassion, willingness to work hard, to be there for each other, to search for equality and justice. Those qualities are what make us the first postnational state.’’

Stepping out of the S.U.V., eager to plunge into the crowd, Trudeau seemed like a man at the beginning of a very big, and very uncertain, journey. ‘‘I’m excited to be on the world stage,’’ he said, with peculiar Canadian understatement mixed with dynastic confidence. ‘‘I think people are starting to see that I’m actually reasonably fit for this office.’’",REAL
The Deported,"Villanueva later described the torture and murder of the uncle who directed the youth group at his family’s church. In 2013, the uncle disappeared after complaining to the police about the 18th Street Gang harassing the group members. A few days later, his body turned up in the Chamelecón River covered with puncture wounds, which investigators deemed to have been inflicted by an ice pick.

‘‘How do you know the gang is connected to the police?’’ the asylum officer asked.

‘‘Everybody knows that in my country,’’ Villanueva said.

‘‘Your attorney submitted an article that indicates the police captured a leader of the 18th Street Gang,’’ the officer pointed out. ‘‘If the gangs are working with the police, why would the police arrest their leaders?’’

‘‘They arrest people so the community thinks they’re doing something. But then they’re out of jail in a week or two.’’

‘‘Why are they released after a week or two?’’

‘‘This is the question that all of the good people of Honduras ask.’’

‘‘Is there anything else that you’re afraid of in Honduras?’’

‘‘No. Just losing my life.’’

Although the officer found Villanueva credible, she did not consider him eligible for asylum; the immigration judge agreed. Villanueva was sent to Louisiana, where he was loaded onto a plane with more than a hundred other Hondurans. They wore manacles on their wrists and ankles, and their hands were shackled to chains around their waists. Armed guards accompanied them. Midway through the flight, bologna sandwiches and cookies were distributed. They were packaged individually, the sandwiches and cookies. Most of the handcuffed men and women found it easiest to tear the plastic with their teeth.

On the outskirts of San Pedro Sula, Ramón Villeda Morales International Airport receives planeloads of Hondurans like Villanueva several times a week. The deportees are unshackled and disembark on the tarmac. They are herded to a processing center, where their belongings are returned to them. Outside the center, family members and girlfriends loiter in the shade, expectantly watching the door. They perk up each time it opens and another deportee emerges. Taxi drivers offer special rates. Money changers wave stacks of Honduran lempiras, buying American dollars. People speak emotionally on phones.

Over the last five years, the United States has deported more than half a million Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans, many of whom, like Villanueva, have had to leave their children behind. Although Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, says it exercises discretion to target lawbreakers for removal, a majority of Central American deportees have no criminal record. Among those who do, about half are guilty of either a traffic violation or an immigration-­related crime — entering the country illegally, for instance. At Ramón Villeda Morales, most arrivals I met were captured while crossing the border. This meant they had recently endured two distinct but often, in their telling, equally arduous ordeals: their voyage through Mexico (sleeping in shelters; trekking through deserts; evading bandits, kidnappers and rapists) and ICE detention.

As soon as they enter the processing center, the deportees are given coffee and baleadas, a Honduran dish of tortillas and beans. The staff members call them ‘‘ma’am’’ and ‘‘sir,’’ make jokes, say ‘‘please’’ and ‘‘thank you.’’ It is as if the staff is trying to convince the deportees that they are not the people they’ve been treated as for the past several days, or weeks, or months. The deportees undergo brief interviews with interlocutors who are all volunteers. One day, I sat at a table beside Dennis Abraham, a 30-year-old singer-­carpenter with wide-open eyes and shoulder-­length hair tied up in a samurai bun. Abraham wore a laminated ID card around his neck that featured his photo beneath a logo for the Geo Group, the international corporation that operates a facility in Texas where he himself was detained just two months ago. When new arrivals sat down across from him, Abraham showed them the ID and said, ‘‘I’m like you.’’

Abraham first left for the United States when he was 16, with his mother, Maria. For two months, they clung together to the tops of northbound freight trains. Then, while fording a deep section of the Rio Grande, they were separated by a swift current. Maria made it to the other side; Abraham, a weak swimmer, was carried downstream. Uncertain what to do, he turned himself in to the Mexican authorities. Back in Honduras, Abraham had no way to get in touch with Maria and no one to take care of him. He decided to try to find her. He was apprehended and deported from Mexico seven times attempting to make the trip. ‘‘The eighth time, they did this to me,’’ Abraham said, holding out his forearms and showing me a latticework of scar tissue. While on the trains, he had fallen into the hands of the Zetas, one of the largest drug cartels in Mexico and among its most prolific practitioners of abduction and extortion. Disinclined to believe that Abraham had no one to contact for a ransom, his captors tied him up in a dark room, beat him, urinated on him, cut him with machetes, threatened to castrate him and forced him to endure mock executions. In the end, they let him work off his debt, and for eight months, Abraham slept in the streets of their town, cleaning their cars.

This all happened almost a decade ago; since then, Abraham had reached the United States, found his mother, married an American, had two children and been deported.

‘‘I have no choice,’’ he said, scrolling through pictures of his children on his phone. ‘‘I have to take the trains again.’’

I watched Abraham interview half a dozen deportees. What he said was true: They were like him. To a middle-­aged farmer who had three daughters in the United States and was on his way to his mother’s town, Abraham said, ‘‘Is there someone where you’re going who might hurt you?’’

‘‘Yes,’’ replied the farmer, removing his hat and rubbing his face with his hands. ‘‘But I have to risk it. I have nowhere else to go.’’

‘‘So you’re afraid to go there?’’

‘‘Yes.’’

‘‘But you’re going there?’’

‘‘Of course.’’

The farmer, like everyone else from the plane, looked both exhausted and disoriented. In general, I had the sense that the deportees were not entirely convinced by the staff’s overt exhibitions of decency. A wariness lingered; the transition was too abrupt. Of course, there was an additional dissonance at play: deep relief at having been liberated from ICE custody and, simultaneously, deep dismay at being back in Honduras.

Later that day, in a pulpería across the road from the proc­essing center, I met a man named Bayron Cardona, who was a nervous wreck. He told me that he and his wife, Belky, had managed to cross the Rio Grande but were so intimidated by the Border Patrol presence in Texas that they decided to reverse course and were arrested while trying to get back to Mexico. Cardona and Belky were recent college graduates, still in their 20s, and last year they opened a computer-­repair shop in a building owned by Belky’s father. Their neighborhood was entirely under the control of the MS-13; members of the gang soon confronted Cardona, demanding an impuesto de guerra, or war tax. Impuestos de guerra are a common source of revenue for gangs throughout Honduras, and in Cardona and Belky’s area, every business paid. The amount the gang wanted far exceeded what Cardona could afford. When he failed to produce the money, the MS-13 threatened to kill him. Cardona and Belky went to the United States Embassy, applied for visas and were denied. Then they alerted the police — ‘‘our big error,’’ Cardona told me. That same day, after the couple closed their shop, someone slid a piece of paper under the metal shutter, a printed letter that read in part: ‘‘We know everything you do. We can kill you in your house or when you’re walking out of church. Call home to see what happens.’’ Cardona and Belky called Belky’s father, with whom they were living. Minutes earlier, he told them, two gunmen on motorcycles had driven by, shooting up the front porch with handguns.

A few weeks later, the couple climbed out of a small boat onto the banks of Texas. It was nighttime. There were ­bushes and then a road and then a fence and then a highway. Their coyote told them there was a gap in the fence that they should run for. Cardona and Belky hid in the bushes. White and green S.U.V.s drove up and down the road; officers patrolled on foot with dogs. Others rode on horseback. A helicopter appeared and hovered low. The rotor wash from its roaring blades flattened the tall grass and exposed the migrants hiding there.

Through the rest of the night and all the next day, Cardona and Belky watched one migrant after another make a dash, get caught. Sometimes, as the migrants ran, the dogs latched onto their pant legs. They were sleep-­deprived and dehydrated. Belky told Cardona she wanted to go back. They had Mexican visas; they would stay there or find another country to flee to. Cardona called the coyote and asked him to send a boat. He and Belky were down by the water, waiting to be collected, when a skiff motored up and flashed a spotlight on them. From the bank, an officer on horseback galloped over and told them not to move.

At a Border Patrol station in McAllen, Cardona and Belky were separated. Cardona was put in a cell with other men that was shockingly cold — a hielera, or icebox, as migrants call them. The men positioned a trash can under the ceiling vent to capture the frigid air; that way, huddled together, they could lie on the concrete floor. After two days, Cardona was transferred to a detention center, where he told an ICE official that he and his wife wanted to request asylum. The ICE official asked for Belky’s name. The next day, she was deported. The next week, so was Cardona. When I met him at the airport in San Pedro Sula, he had not seen Belky since their apprehension.

A few days later, I visited the couple at Belky’s father’s house. I met Cardona at a nearby restaurant so he could guide my driver through his neighborhood. He was anxious and fidgety. His father-­in-­law had paid half the war tax that they owed the MS-13 and told the gang that he and Belky were in America; Cardona didn’t know what would happen when the gang discovered they were back. He had changed the way he wore his hair, grown a beard and replaced his contacts with prescription glasses. We passed the building where his business used to be — it was now a barber shop. As we turned onto Cardona’s street, an MS-13 lookout, a teenager in a tank top, eyeballed us as we drove by. We rolled the windows down, a rule throughout Honduras when entering gang territory.

Climbing the front steps of his house, Cardona pointed out the divots in the walls where the bullets from the drive-by had struck. He went inside and returned with the death-threat letter that was slid into his shop. His father-­in-­law had found a nine-­millimeter shell, he told me, and probably still had it. I said that was fine, I didn’t need to see the shell. Belky came out, and we sat in the driveway between two huge barking dogs tethered to short chains. One had a painful-­looking knob protruding from its brow. Someone had hit it with a bat or a pipe, Cardona explained, while stealing their propane tanks.

Belky cried several times as she spoke. In McAllen, she told me, she was also put in a hielera. She was in it for three days, with many other women and young children, including a newborn and her mother, who had undergone a cesarean. The detainees were issued thin Mylar blankets for warmth; they all slept on the floor. There were no showers, and the only toilet had a camera aimed at it. Every 24 hours, each detainee was given two bologna sandwiches.

Belky said that when she told the guards she wished to claim asylum, they advised her that she did not have that right. ‘‘They make you sign all these documents in English,’’ she said, ‘‘and we just don’t know what we’re signing.’’

Neither Cardona nor Belky believed that they could safely remain in Honduras. But Belky, who had not left the house since she had arrived more than a week ago, was against returning to America. For her, more than anything, the whole experience had been profoundly humiliating. Before we said goodbye, she described being called into a room in McAllen where officers studied a bank of monitors showing video feed from cameras that surveilled a section of the border. ‘‘They laugh at us,’’ she told me, her face compressed with resentment. ‘‘One officer was celebrating all the people they’d caught. They watch the people crossing — and they laugh at us.’’

I went back to visit Cardona and Belky a couple of weeks later. As we drove though their neighborhood, we passed a group of young men surrounding someone in a crouch. The men were knocking on the top of his head with their knuckles — not violently, but with odd restraint. This was the gang’s way, I later learned, of issuing one of their own a symbolic reprimand, a warning.

Belky told me that she still had not set foot outside the house.

When I spotted him at the airport, Villanueva was in the pulpería, sitting at a wooden table with a Pepsi. As he raised the bottle, I noticed a tattoo across his hand — the name ‘‘Haley.’’ He wore a blue Kansas City Royals hat. At his feet was a gym bag.

After we spoke for a bit, I asked whether anyone was coming to get him.

Villanueva laughed self-­consciously. ‘‘I don’t think so,’’ he admitted. He had loose curls, a sparse beard and a slight overbite that seemed to facilitate his tendency to mumble. I offered him a ride, and he accepted.

A striking characteristic of San Pedro Sula is the intimate proximity of ostentatious wealth and extreme poverty — a multi­story mall with valet parking on one side of a river, squalid slums and jungle on the other. On our way to the place where Villanueva’s family lived, we passed block after block of ornate adobe mansions ensconced behind tall walls. Atop the walls was razor wire; atop the wire, electric fencing. Men with rifles manned the gates.

‘‘Look at that,’’ Villanueva kept saying as we drove. He was deported once before, in 2008, and spent two weeks in San Pedro Sula before heading back to Kansas City; still, a lot had changed since then. We pulled onto a rocky side street that turned off the pavement into an undeveloped area, lushly overgrown. Here and there, shanties had been patched together using salvaged tin. Villanueva had arranged to stay with his aunt Marta in a one-room plywood structure that stood in an open field amid boulders, thick weeds and mango trees. By the time he stepped out from the car, he was smiling again.

‘‘Man,’’ he said in English, looking around, shouldering his bag. ‘‘It’s weird to be here, you know?’’

I stopped by a few days later and found Villanueva sitting on a boulder, talking on a cellphone to his younger son. ‘‘No, my love, you can’t come,’’ he was saying. ‘‘Behave, O.K.? Don’t fight with your sisters, understand?’’ When he hung up, Villanueva told me, ‘‘I don’t know how to explain it to them.’’

‘‘They don’t know?’’

He shook his head. ‘‘They think I’m on a job.’’

A sheet obstructing the entrance to Marta’s shack was pulled back, and a young man with gelled hair and a tight T-shirt stepped out. It was Villanueva’s younger brother, Oscar. After being arrested on a D.U.I. charge, he had recently been deported as well. Back in Colorado, Oscar told me, he had a wife, a daughter and a son. All of them were citizens.

While Villanueva had been surprisingly good-­humored at the airport and remained so that day (sort of grinning at his situation even as he lamented it), Oscar was morose. He spoke so softly that I had to lean in to hear, and when I asked how his kids were holding up without him, he hung his head, sighed, ‘‘Those kids,’’ and wept.

Altogether, five people were living in Marta’s shack. Tacked-­up bedding divided the sleeping area from the kitchen area. At night, Oscar and Villanueva laid a mattress on the floor. They rarely left the property. Neither had acclimated to the dangers of the city of their youth; the daily slaughter to which most of San Pedro Sula’s residents were by now inured still distressed the brothers as it might a typical American. One morning when I invited them to breakfast, we encountered a taped-­off crime scene a few blocks from their house. A body was sprawled facedown on the sidewalk, and there was another in the street. You could see solid pieces in the blood around their heads. Forensic experts in white coats placed numbered markers near the bullet casings — 47 of them, so far. The few people who had gathered looked mostly unimpressed. Many passers-­by didn’t bother stopping.

‘‘It’s been a long time since I’ve seen that,’’ Villanueva said.

‘‘Welcome to Honduras,’’ Oscar said.

When I took them home several hours later, we passed the scene again. The crowd had dispersed, and the forensic experts were gone. The bodies, though, remained.

Nobody had covered them. Traffic carried on.

The contrast between the reality of San Pedro Sula and the insular world that Villanueva’s family had created on their little side street struck me every time I visited. More than 15 relatives occupied three different houses there. They often gathered in the evenings on an old musty couch and a few metal benches outside Marta’s shack. A yellow school bus belonging to their church sat nearby — ‘‘God Bless Honduras’’ and ‘‘Never Give Up’’ colorfully decaled across the windshields. Children pushed one another around in mop buckets and on dollies over a square of cracked foundation in the grass. Usually, Villanueva’s grandmother would be cooking baleadas or pots of rice and beans over a wood fire in an outdoor grill fashioned from a chunk of concrete. Dogs and kittens begged for scraps. Everyone was always laughing.

One night while chatting with Villanueva and Oscar, I heard a violinist playing a classical concerto I didn’t know — I don’t know any classical concertos — but whose beauty was astonishing. Villanueva led me past the bus and through the trees to a small house set back from the road. There, his 22-year-old cousin stood on a dilapidated porch beneath a naked bulb, immersed in her performance. As she played — the composer, she told me later, was Mozart — her two younger sisters emerged from the house with their own violins.

One of them also played the keyboard in the family church’s band. Some nights later, I went with Villanueva to a service. When it was over, another cousin took the worshipers home in the school bus. It was so crowded that many had to stand. As we left behind the heavily fortified entrances to private communities and continued into the ramshackle barrios where the congregation lived, there was a raucous, joyful energy. Each person who got off kissed or hugged every other passenger onboard. So incongruous, all that good will. It took a couple hours to circumnavigate the city, and during that time we passed two taped-­off crime scenes, as well as an assault: about a dozen teenagers kicking someone on the sidewalk curled into a squirming ball.

Besides attending church, Villanueva had little else to do. Each day’s main event was his afternoon phone call to Bueno and the kids. Neither he nor Bueno had told them yet that he’d been deported. Briana, who turned 10 the day before Villanueva was flown back to Honduras, and Jesse, who was 8, were coping with his absence better than their younger siblings. Haley, who was 4 and whose name was tattooed across the back of Villanueva’s hand, had always been the most attached to Villanueva. She used to wait up for him with Bueno whenever he worked late. Now Haley refused to go to sleep, determined to be awake if he returned. Villanueva’s 3-year-old son, Jordi, had grown uncharacteristically introverted and lethargic, sleeping most of the day and rarely speaking.

Bueno, who had remained home with the children after she and Villanueva moved in together, had gone back to work, cleaning an office building seven nights a week while her mother babysat. She returned to the apartment around 2 a.m., woke at 7 to get the kids ready for school, picked up Haley at noon, made lunch for her and Jordi, met Briana and Jesse at the bus stop at 4:30, cooked supper at 6 and left for work again when her mother arrived at 8.

Villanueva was desperate to find out whether there was any possibility of reuniting with them legally. His first few days in Honduras, he seemed optimistic. The immigration attorney Bueno hired to help him with his asylum claim had filed a petition with the Board of Immigration Appeals. The petition was still pending, and after consulting with the attorney, Bueno believed that their odds were good. The appeals process was going to cost them an additional $5,000, on top of the $4,750 Bueno had already paid and the $8,000 she still owed in monthly installments; if there was a decent chance, though, they would find the money.

That meant borrowing. The legal fees, along with the $1,000 phone bill Villanueva had racked up during his two months in the county jail ($1 per minute talking to Bueno and the children), had depleted all their savings. To pay the attorney, Bueno had taken out a series of loans from an informal moneylender, who charged 5 percent interest every week. Villanueva’s employer, meanwhile, had stopped answering his phone. Earlier in the year, Villanueva’s team had built out the kitchens of more than a hundred new apartment units in Kansas City’s River Market neighborhood; the contractor still owed Villanueva $28,000 for the job. Before he was arrested, Villanueva had planned to use the payment to buy a neglected house at auction, fix it up in secret, take Bueno there when it was ready and propose. Now he knew he’d never see the money. Although he filed taxes every year and reported to the I.R.S. all the wages that he paid his team (the I.R.S. doesn’t investigate the citizenship of taxpayers), there was no recourse to collect the debt.

When Villanueva expressed to me his hopefulness about his asylum claim, I was dubious. He had already been deported, after all, and that decision is seldom rescinded. Later, with Villanueva in the room, I called his attorney in Kansas City and asked him myself what he thought was the likelihood that the Board of Immigration Appeals would both consider and grant the appeal. The attorney, Allan Bell, told me: ‘‘The direct answer to your question is the chances are slim. I did not say slim to none. The chances are slim. I’ll use the word ‘remote.’ ’’ I asked what other options there might be for Villanueva to return, and Bell asked to speak in a few days, with Bueno conferencing in.

In fact, there were no options. An estimated 4.5 million American-­born children have undocumented mothers or fathers, and every year tens of thousands of them lose at least one parent to deportation. In November 2014, President Obama took executive action to institute a series of reforms that would have granted temporary work permits to some parents of United States citizens and residents. Texas and 25 other states promptly filed a lawsuit arguing that the order was unconstitutional, and a federal judge in Brownsville — a major crossing point for migrants and asylum seekers on the Texas border — issued an injunction against the programs. For now, citizens can petition for their parents to obtain green cards only after turning 21. For Haley, the older of Villanueva’s two biological children, that would be in 17 years. Moreover, because Villanueva had been deported once before, he was subject to a pair of 10-year ‘‘time bars.’’ This required him to spend a minimum of two decades outside the country, as punishment, before he could become eligible to apply for permission to re-­enter.

When Villanueva and Bueno next spoke to Bell, Bell asked that I not be present for the conversation. I obliged, but Villanueva recorded it. The tape is disturbing. Bell, now dim on the appeal, suggests that Villanueva seek something called humanitarian parole and offers to steer the process for $3,000. Although Villanueva and Bueno — leery of spending more money on a long shot — press him about the likelihood of success, Bell fails to give them a straight answer. (I later spoke with several other immigration attorneys, all of whom held that humanitarian parole — which typically provides a temporary visa valid for family emergencies — was not a viable option for Villanueva.) At one point, exasperated, Villanueva stops using his interpreter and tries to speak directly to Bell in English. ‘‘I want to make sure, because I don’t want to spend more money, more time,’’ he says. ‘‘Because I want to be with my family over there. You know? I want — ’’

‘‘Well, I know. The whole thing is terrible, I couldn’t agree with you more.’’

‘‘Don’t tell me that, man,’’ Villanueva says, raising his voice. ‘‘I know it’s terrible. I’m in Honduras right now, far away from my family.’’

‘‘Right, right, right.’’

‘‘What I want to know is something clear, man. Do you think it’s possible we going to win this case, or are we going to lose it?’’

‘‘I personally think it’s possible. ... ’’ Bell trails off, seems to walk away, comes back and then says: ‘‘Now hold on, please, I have to explain something. Let me explain to everybody. I know none of you know this, and I’m sure none of you care — but the Kansas City Royals baseball team is playing the championship for the American League right now. It’s a big thing here. I think Suelen knows. Am I correct, Suelen?’’

After a pause, Bueno says, ‘‘Yes.’’

‘‘It’s on national television,’’ Bell continues.

‘‘I don’t care about the Royals right now, man,’’ Villanueva says, again in English. ‘‘I’m worried about my case, about my family.’’

‘‘I’m here,’’ Bell says. ‘‘I’m not going to the game because of you. I gave my tickets away so I could help you. It’s on world television right now. The Kansas City Royals against the Houston team. But anyway, I’ll help you, don’t worry.’’

After the call, I took Villanueva out to lunch. He ate and spoke little. The resilient cheerfulness that I had marveled at was gone, and for the first time, it occurred to me that the difference between Villanueva and his brother Oscar might not be constitutional, after all. Maybe the only difference was that Oscar had been stuck in Honduras, away from his family, longer than Villanueva had.

I asked what he was thinking.

Villanueva looked up, shook his head and said, ‘‘I’m thinking I have to make the trip again.’’

The last time Villanueva made the trip, he very nearly died. In 2008, after his first deportation — he was arrested at a party where someone else was caught with cocaine — he spent a month riding the trains by himself through Mexico and then waded across the Rio Grande with a group of some 20 other migrants. In the middle of their second day of following a coyote through the Texas desert, a small plane buzzed overhead and the rev of four-­wheelers approached. Everybody scattered. Villanueva found a narrow, dry arroyo and hid beneath a rocky outcrop. Five hours later, he climbed out and started walking. He walked through the night and in the morning fell asleep. Around noon, he was woken by the heat. He had no backpack or supplies. The coyote had told him to keep the sun on his left and the shadows on his right — when it got dark, Villanueva guessed which way was north. Five days after crossing the border, and his third day alone, half-­starved and in dire need of water, he came upon a skeleton. It was small, probably an adolescent. The skull was clean bone. Several of its teeth had fallen out. Nearby lay a blue denim knapsack. Villanueva emptied it. Inside the knapsack was a bag of bread — black with mold — but also a can of beans and a can of peaches. Villanueva used a sharp stone to pierce a small gash in the can of peaches. He downed the sweet syrup and pried the can open and ate the sweet pieces. He chugged the beans.

The food gave him enough strength to walk the rest of the afternoon and most of the night. Still, the next day Villanueva knew he might not make it. He prayed for a patrol to find him, for an airplane or a helicopter. He was staggering forward weakly when he glimpsed a far-off, incandescent spray. He saw a truck and a man squatting near its bumper. The man wore a head shield — he was welding something to the metal. Villanueva squinted. It felt like a hallucination: the vivid, molten shower splashing off the frame.

‘‘Help!’’ Villanueva screamed. ‘‘Help me!’’

The coyote had warned that ranchers in this part of Texas sometimes shot migrants if they caught them on their land. Villanueva didn’t care. He wanted food. He wanted water.

‘‘Help me, please!’’

The man continued welding. Eventually, it occurred to Villanueva that perhaps God didn’t want the man to hear. Perhaps God wanted Villanueva to keep going.

Before night fell, he collapsed. He was lying in the hot dirt while the colors went out in the enormous sky, and he was thinking about the skeleton, its teeth, when he saw tracers streaming through the distant dark. He rose and stumbled toward them. They were the lights of tractor-­trailers driving on a highway.

A wire fence ran parallel to the shoulder. He found a culvert and crawled through it to the other side. For the rest of the night, he stayed to the chaparral; the next morning, he detected a faint rhythmic pounding and recognized it as a jackhammer. The sound energized him with fresh hope. If there was a jackhammer, there was construction. If there was construction, there were migrants. A little while later, he found a team of Mexicans ripping up a driveway.

The Mexicans lived across the border but had special visas that permitted them to commute for work. They gave Villanueva some of the food they had brought for lunch. One let him borrow a cellphone. Villanueva called his cousin in Kansas, who offered to wire $500 to anyone willing to drive Villanueva to San Antonio. Most of the Mexicans were afraid to jeopardize their visas — but when the team quit for the day, a worker in his early 30s agreed to take him. He took Villanueva in his pickup to a Walmart, where he could retrieve the wired money. Villanueva’s cousin had sent an extra $100 for Villanueva, and after bidding farewell to the Mexican, he bought new socks and underwear, a T-shirt and a pair of pants. He went into the bathroom and washed his face and arms.

When Villanueva walked out of the store, the Mexican was waiting for him. ‘‘Come on, let me buy you a hamburger,’’ he said.

The man took him to a McDonald’s and ordered him a Big Mac. When they finished, he drove him to a motel and paid for two nights.

‘‘Rest,’’ he told Villanueva.

Since then, reaching the United States has become only more difficult. Last summer, while an exodus of Central Americans was overwhelming U.S. immigration facilities, the Mexican government began implementing a host of aggressive enforcement measures on its southern border. Many of the migrants leaving Central America were unaccompanied minors; while the United States is obligated to assess their eligibility for refugee protections, Mexico can simply bus them back. The crackdown has been a boon for ICE and the Border Patrol. So far this year, the number of Central American migrants apprehended in the United States has fallen by half compared with last year. The number of Central American migrants apprehended in Mexico is on track to increase by 70 percent.

In Honduras, the buses from Mexico bearing adult deportees without children arrive at a processing center just across the Guatemalan border. The center occupies a scenic beachfront property seized in September from a drug trafficker. I spent several days there; nearly everyone I spoke to had been captured in the deep south of Mexico. A vast majority, traveling in passenger vans, had been intercepted at roadblocks manned by the federal police, Army soldiers and immigration agents.

Juveniles and families with children are sent to a different center, off the highway on the outskirts of San Pedro Sula. Unaccompanied deportees as young as 8 have shown up there. One day, I met a mother who had left Honduras with her 16-year-old daughter after gang members tried to rape her in her school. Another woman on the same bus had left with her 4-year-old son after her brother was murdered. All four were standing on the shoulder of the highway, waiting for taxis to take them back to the neighborhoods they had fled.

If Villanueva did go north, he would need to hire a coyote. You could not traverse Mexico without one now. These days, the reputable guides were charging $8,000, Honduras to Houston. They gave you three tries. If caught a third time, you lost your money.

Even if Villanueva managed to get through Mexico, he would face the prospect of felony charges, in addition to deportation, if he was arrested on the United States border. Although entering the country without documentation has always been a crime, as recently as a decade ago public attorneys rarely prosecuted migrants in federal court. That has changed. Today, illegal entry and re-­entry are the most-­prosecuted federal offenses in the United States, and the Justice Department receives more cases from ICE than it does from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives combined. Prison sentences for people with multiple illegal entries, like Villanueva, can last more than 10 years.

Say, though, Villanueva made it to Kansas City. He would still spend the rest of his life there in danger. Because of the 20-year time bar from his deportations, he would be ineligible for legal status even after Haley grew old enough to petition for him.

When I talked to Villanueva about this, he said it didn’t matter: As soon as the kids were out of the house, he and Bueno would happily return to Honduras. They would buy some land, build a house. The kids could visit them during school holidays or vacations from work.

‘‘I just need to raise them,’’ Villanueva said.

A week or so after he got back, Villanueva went with Oscar to visit their mother, Francesca, who lived a couple of hours away, in her hometown, Toyos. In the last 15 years, Villanueva had seen Francesca only once, in 2008. Neither he nor Oscar harbored any grudges toward her for leaving them when they were young. Growing up, they sometimes went to Toyos to escape the 18th Street Gang. Back then, Francesca lived in a shanty that she built herself from bamboo and cardboard boxes; she made a living washing clothes in a nearby river. With the money her children had sent back from Missouri, Francesca had since moved into a small block house with electricity and running water. When we arrived, she was standing at a portable camping stove, making chicken soup.

‘‘My son!’’ Francesca gasped when she saw Villanueva.

‘‘You look shorter,’’ Villanueva laughed.

While the soup boiled, Villanueva sat with Francesca at the table, swiping through the pictures on his phone: Jesse at a lake where they liked to fish for bass, Briana making snow angels, Jordi and Haley riding bumper cars at a family entertainment center. Francesca observed the pictures mutely. She had never been to America, seen snow or heard of a family entertainment center.

Oscar sat across the table, drawing designs on a white cloth Francesca had given him. Later, she would embroider the designs with colored thread. Oscar held up the cloth for her to see. Penciled vines and leaves curled around the edges, blooming into roses.

‘‘Is it good?’’ he asked.

‘‘It’s good,’’ Francesca said.

When I seconded her opinion, Oscar went into the bedroom and came back with a stack of envelopes. They were from his time in detention. On both sides of each envelope Oscar had drawn intricate images in ballpoint pen. He still had the pen. It was short and made from flexible rubber so as to preclude stabbing.

From one envelope, I withdrew a sheet of notebook paper with six verses handwritten in Spanish. It was a song Oscar had composed and sung over the phone to his son on his sixth birthday. The last verse read:

Although you’re young

some day you will understand

why I wasn’t there

on your special day.

Before we left Francesca’s, I asked about a framed photograph on the wall. It showed Villanueva, Oscar, their brother, Henry, and their sister, Miriam, standing beside a skimpily ornamented Christmas tree, arms draped on one another. Their uncle had taken it in Kansas City in 2004, the only year all four siblings were in the United States together.

I recognized the same photograph a couple of weeks later, hanging in Villanueva’s father’s house. Although he lived a few short blocks away, Javier Villanueva had little to do with the rest of the family — he did not attend the church or share any of his relatives’ evangelical fervor — and Villanueva had seen him only once since arriving in Honduras.

Javier’s home was one in a crowded row precariously situated on a rocky river bank. It was somewhat bigger than Marta’s plywood shack and marginally better appointed. There was a toilet rigged to plumbing rather than an outhouse — and a television. We found Javier watching a James Bond film dubbed in Spanish. He was skinny, in shorts and a tank top, with a mustache and the same curly black hair as Villanueva. He sat at a cluttered table, upon which numerous white mice scurried about. There were at least a dozen of them, and they appeared to be multiplying. I spotted a box with a hole in its lid through which opposing traffic issued and vanished.

‘‘You still have the mice,’’ Villanueva said with displeasure.

‘‘We want to sell them,’’ Javier explained.

‘‘So why don’t you?’’

‘‘We tried. Nobody will buy them.’’

Javier’s girlfriend served up cups of Pepsi and arroz con leche. Three children, Villanueva’s half-­siblings, entered the room. He greeted them cordially, impersonally. I asked their ages, and the woman revealed that today one of the boys had turned 10.

‘‘It’s his birthday?’’ asked Javier, surprised. He laughed. ‘‘And his dad didn’t even know!’’

Javier offered Villanueva a cigarette, and the two of them went outside. It was the first cigarette I’d seen Villanueva smoke. When they came back, they were talking construction. Javier was a tiler by trade. Villanueva told him about some of the carpentry projects he had done in Kansas City. He took out his phone and showed him pictures of the cabinetry he installed in the River Market units.

Javier said nothing.

‘‘Where can I get used lumber to leave Aunt Marta?’’ Villanueva asked him.

‘‘I don’t know.’’

‘‘How much is half-inch plywood here?’’

‘‘I don’t know, I need some too,’’ Javier said. ‘‘I need to build a bathroom, but I don’t have any money.’’ An expectant silence followed, and when it became clear that Villanueva was not going to fill it with an offer of assistance, Javier said, ‘‘I’ll buy cardboard instead.’’

Eventually, Villanueva stood to leave. He and Javier shook hands. Javier didn’t ask how long Villanueva would be in town or whether he would see him again.

Above all, what had caused Bueno to fall in love with Villanueva was his way with Jesse and Briana. From the moment they met at the soccer game, he seemed as enamored of her kids as he was of Bueno. It was Villanueva who, shortly after they started dating, realized that something wasn’t right with Jesse. The boy was 3 and hardly talked. Bueno had told herself that he was just a little late, that some kids developed slower, that it was no big deal. Villanueva insisted on consulting a doctor. Jesse, it turned out, was almost deaf. They had him fit for hearing aids and enrolled him in speech therapy. Jesse quickly turned into a different person. He became loquacious, socialized more with other kids, excelled in his classes.

‘‘Jesse and Briana don’t know that he’s not their real father,’’ Bueno told me when I met with her in Kansas City a week after I left Honduras. We were sitting in the living room of their apartment. Briana and Jesse were at school; Haley and Jordi were asleep, sprawled in Bueno’s lap. ‘‘We’re not going to keep it a secret forever. I just want them to grow up a little more. I’m afraid to tell them, because they love him so much.’’

We spoke, then, about the other secret. Bueno still had not revealed to any of the children that Villanueva had been deported. ‘‘It’s very difficult, because I don’t know how to explain it to them,’’ she said. ‘‘They’ve never been separated from him before. I don’t know what to say. I just keep telling them that he’s traveling for work, he’ll be home soon.’’

Later, while stroking Haley’s hair, Bueno said: ‘‘It’s the hardest for her. She can’t sleep at night without him.’’

Bueno’s job cleaning the office building seven nights a week paid about $1,000 a month. A fifth of that she gave to the moneylender from whom she borrowed to pay the immigration attorney. The moneylender had the title to Bueno’s car, and what would happen if she fell behind? How would she get Haley and Jordi to school? How would she get to work? Their most valuable possessions had been the power tools that Villanueva had accumulated, piecemeal, over the years: a table saw, a miter saw, half a dozen screw guns. Villanueva had explained to Bueno that it was an investment — this way, he and his team would be less dependent on the gringo contractors. Shortly after Villanueva was detained, however, the contractor for whom he used to work — the one who Villanueva claims owes him $28,000 — came to the apartment and left with all the tools, telling Bueno they were his.

At 4:30, she woke up Jordi and Haley, and the four of us walked down to the highway to meet Briana and Jesse where the school bus dropped them off.

I spotted an energetic, grinning boy with hearing aids running down the sidewalk. A girl in glasses trailed behind them, toting a violin case.

‘‘You must be Briana,’’ I said when she reached us.

‘‘Why does he know our names?’’ Briana asked her mother.

‘‘He’s a friend of your dad’s,’’ Bueno said.

‘‘Daddy!’’

Briana regarded me anew, and I could see her formulating the question. I braced for it. Where is he? What happened to him? When is he coming home? Then she seemed to think better, and we walked the rest of the way back in silence.",REAL
Consider (Cooking) the Clam,"Photo

‘‘To catch a clam,’’ begins a book I find profound on many subjects, ‘‘you must first find it.’’ Mr. Curtis Badger, the author, is aware that with his pleonasm, he risks sounding obvious. But he has his reasons. To him, finding a clam entails thinking like one. Clams are so different from humans that good interspecies relations demand sometimes considering just what a clam is after: a shallow, sandy substrate of the ocean floor, in a salt marsh, amid Spartina grasses, surrounded by other clams and a steady tidal flow.

In addition to helping you catch one, this inventory of the clam’s needs also supplies a crucial reminder: The domestic clam, found in saltwater columns along all of our coasts, is today, as ever, one of the very best beings for humans to find, catch and cook. (‘‘Clams: How to Find, Catch and Cook Them’’ is the 2002 book’s comprehensive title.) There seems to be a certain group of happy eaters who are scared to cook clams, sufferers of a clamophobia that keeps the many advantages of clam cooking out of reach. Revisiting Mr. Badger recently convinced me that it is a fear — like that of heights or open water — worth mastering.

The clam population is strong. Clams are harvested at low tide, generally raked by hand or at worst shallow-dredged. Though they can make for cold digging in the winter, clams are available and fine to eat year-round. Most at seafood stores are farmed, but culinarily speaking, the farmed clam, bred and schooled alongside its wild kin, tastes as rich, sweet and saline as its savage sibling. And the farmed clam represents the rare aquaculture specimen that is beneficial to the ecosystem in which it is raised. Clams, like oysters, are filter feeders. Their insides chug along, unconsciously benevolent sieves, improving the quality of water that moves through them.

Clams are also ancient human food. Shell middens prove that humans on seashores on every continent have been thinking like clams and finding and catching them since we shed our scales and emerged from their midst. Moreover, clams are Good for You — full of zinc, iron and B vitamins. Folklore even considers them on the near side of moral health, even as their kissing cousin, the oyster, is suspected of inspiring all sorts of hungers, namely for human flesh and for more oysters. I do not know how the clam ended up the virgin and the oyster the harlot, other than to admit that in my personal experience, she who is moved to order a dozen cherrystones over a dozen Belons eats to live, rather than the reverse.

For those wondering about the clam’s perspective on all this, it is worth noting that a clam has no brain. (To ‘‘think like a clam’’ is rhetorical.) A clam comprises two graceful curved shells, symmetrical and ringed, connected by a muscle. It is probably true that, as Mr. Badger attests, the phrase ‘‘happy as a clam’’ was invented because the simple bivalve ‘‘has only two goals in life: to eat and to have sex.’’

Whence the clamophobia? Perhaps it’s because whenever you start to read about cooking clams, you come immediately upon the sorts of tips that telegraph the existence of serious, implicit problems. There are strategies ‘‘to get rid of grit.’’ We are warned ‘‘to keep from overcooking.’’ And to make sure a clam is alive, not dead, because eating a clam that has died in its shell is known to make you very sick. But most clams aren’t grittier than a hard wash under cold tap water will resolve; truly gritty clams just need to be washed repeatedly, even after cooking, until they surrender the last of their sand. Clams, unlike oysters, do not go from delicious to terrible in a mistaken extra minute of cooking. (Still, I find a good rule in my correspondence with a South Carolinian gastronome on the subject of edible mollusks: ‘‘What’s the old joke?’’ he asked. ‘‘Best way to cook fish is to have a waiter put it on a tray and walk it very slowly through a hot kitchen.’’) As for the fear you will mistakenly eat or serve a bad one: As with oysters, a dead clam can be smelled from a mile away.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: SmartWool Socks,"Photo

In recent years, I have taken note of a creeping subversive streak in sock culture, from the outrageously patterned stockings peeking from beneath the cuffs of straphanging bankers to the pot-­leaf-­printed numbers worn by skateboarders. Like a paper bag around a can of Coors Banquet, the lowly sock seems to have become a vehicle for safe transgression. Even those of us hemmed in by dress code can still challenge society’s strictures, from ankle ­height. And although my home office makes no particular demands on my wardrobe, I, too, have been protesting quietly with my feet.

My transgression has less to do with style than with inertia. Sometimes, mostly between November and February, I wear the same pair of socks for several days in a row. I realize that public-­health officers and podiatrists would probably condemn the practice and that in some circles it might be considered a breach of the social contract. I cannot help considering the ill effects that such a public confession might have on my professional and romantic prospects. And yet, in fall and winter, when guests in private homes are often expected to go shoeless, I pad beyond the foyers of my snootiest hosts, confident that my socks will neither foul the air nor even slouch about the ankles.

It might seem brazen to blame others for a habit so personal, peculiar and obviously related to laziness. But I have a great enabler in SmartWool socks. Founded in the 1990s by a pair of ski instructors from Vermont named Patty and Peter Duke, SmartWool has been a great modern popularizer of merino wool. Corporate lore holds that the Dukes, blistered and fetid from years of inferior footwear, canvassed the globe searching for a better way. They found one at the peripheries of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, where many of the world’s merino sheep are herded, in New Zealand and Australia.

On Sept. 3, an Australian sheep named Chris set the world record for a single shearing, yielding 90 pounds of wool, or enough, roughly, to make any one of the following: 120 Disana baby onesies. 157 Patagonia lightweight hoodies for women. 211 L.L. Bean beanies. 429 pairs of SmartWool Trekking Heavy Crew socks.

The merino were first cultivated during the Middle Ages in Spain, whose rulers so revered the creatures that local law prescribed death for citizens caught exporting them. It wasn’t until Napoleon invaded, disrupting sheep-­related executions, that the breed freely disseminated. In Vermont, in the 1830s and 1840s, a period of ‘‘merino mania’’ took hold. For a while, more than one million of them roamed the state, but wild fluctuations in wool prices drove farmers from the trade, and the breed dwindled long before the Dukes came calling.

We have since learned just how delicate merino fibers are. They measure less than 26 microns in diameter, or about a quarter the thickness of a human hair, a fineness that lends them a silky caress ideal for contact with the skin. They are highly ‘‘crimped’’ too — each fiber wound tight, spring-­loaded — a feature that affords SmartWool socks a preternaturally resilient elasticity. Light, toasty pockets of a limber and luxurious mail, they do not, as a rule, lose their shape. The material draws moisture away from the skin, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable — and neutral-­smelling — for days. In the journey from coat of sheep to sock of man, the wool is furthermore subjected, according to promotional literature, to ‘‘smart technology,’’ a process through which SmartWool socks are said to acquire bolstered wicking and warming properties. These socks won’t shrink in the dryer. Also: They don’t itch.",REAL
What Should I Have Done After an I.V.F. Mix-Up?,"Without my divulging what occurred, can you weigh in on the ethical considerations of my plight and my responsibilities to the other parents? And how the morning-after pill affects that responsibility? I did refuse the hospital permission to inform the other couple of my circumstances until I could decide my course of action. Obviously, this dilemma has stayed with me as one of the defining events of my life. I have never thought and agonized with such intensity in my life, all while failing to make any progress toward a decision I could believe with confidence was ‘‘right.’’ Name Withheld

There’s excellent reason for your uncertainties. Our intuitions about the moral significance of childbearing are more secure when the gestational mother is the genetic mother, because, for most of human history, that has been the only possibility. We have long practice in thinking about adoption — in which the social and the biological parents are distinct — because adoption, too, is age-old. But when the genetic mother is not the gestational mother? There, we have no long-established traditions.

When you say that the genetic parents were the ‘‘rightful parents,’’ you’re saying you think they had the rights over the embryo that parents normally have. Yet this was not a normal situation. So let’s establish a few ground rules. Those rights can’t include requiring you to undergo the risks of a medical intervention (like the lavage technique, which the hospital thought was medically dangerous for you) or to have an abortion.

Beyond the moral status of abortion, about which people in this country are deeply divided, there is the issue of bodily autonomy. It would even apply to a patient who received a kidney meant for someone else, owing to a transplant-list mistake. What was done can’t be undone. You can’t require an unwitting patient to submit to the removal of what was given to her in error.

Given that you consider the genetic parents to be the ‘‘rightful parents,’’ that the genetic mother told you she didn’t want you carrying her child and that you think terminating an early pregnancy is morally permissible, you had good reason to do so. But as we’ve seen, this conclusion comes with a waiver: You were perfectly within your rights not to do so. Often we have the right not to do something we have very good moral reasons to do.

Which brings us to a fiercely contested question. Whose baby would this be? You don’t indicate that your predicament led to a conflict other than your internal one. In similar situations when the question was litigated, though, courts around the world have been divided. If you’d had a surrogacy agreement, the law of contracts would have helped decide. (You would surely have given up the child had you agreed to do so before the embryo was implanted.) If embryos were simple possessions, morally speaking, property law might have done the work. But they aren’t.

Our moral intuitions certainly pull us in different directions. Imagine the anguish of parents who had conceived a child, had hoped to raise it, had perhaps dared to imagine a future of clarinet lessons and soccer games. Now they must picture her being raised by strangers — forever a phantom member of their family, an ache of absence. Yet a womb is not an Airbnb rental. So imagine the gestational mother who has nurtured and sustained the child within her uterus; now her colostrum flows as the infant latches onto her breast to nurse. At which point, exactly, do you want to usher an officer into her room to take that infant away?

Your reference to your ‘‘own family goals’’ suggests that you think you would have been obligated to hand the child over to the genetic parents. I disagree. Perhaps you thought the embryo belonged to them. But as I’ve said, it isn’t helpful, morally, to think of embryos as property. You would have been entitled to hand the child over (assuming he or she was wanted), and this might have been a generous act. But if you carried the child for nine months, I can’t see that you would have had an automatic obligation to do so.

Medical negligence, sadly, put you in circumstances where distress lay at every turn. No surprise that your own hasn’t fully subsided. New technologies can call on us to develop new moral traditions — traditions that offer a set of expectations and norms. They may not spare us from agony, but they can, at least, lessen our agonizing.",REAL
When the ‘Narrative’ Becomes the Story,"The particular ‘‘narrative’’ of political journalists tended to emphasize the process dynamics — who’s up, who’s down — in addition to what the media itself are doing. Because so many political reporters appear regularly on television (and are readily aligned with a particular shtick or point of view), the people writing political stories themselves have never been such a big part of the stories. Reporters friend and follow each other on social media, where they might also have distinctive personae. Twitter incubates its own #packjournalism, where narratives are shared, debated and reinforced within the virtual horde.

Obama understands narrative better than most. Our narrative glut of recent years lines up with the start of his national rise, for a variety of reasons, including the advent of social media. But equally important is the literary bent of its chief protagonist, the author-president. His autobiography, ‘‘Dreams From My Father,’’ told the story of his journey to racial identity and reconciliation. His campaign of 2008 spun a narrative about a candidate as a figure of national reconciliation.

He was first elected as an outsider, presenting himself as an unsullied Mr. Smith type. Though he had been a senator for a few years, he was unsteeped in the tribal assumptions and reflexive inertia of entrenched Washington narratives.

‘‘The Obama narrative’’ soon became a rolling meta-cliché for the saga of our storyteller in chief. The media get a lot of blame here, as we rightly do for most clichés. We default to them as readily as we do narratives (so this one is kind of a twofer). The Obama narrative featured subclichés involving the president’s attempts to ‘‘get his groove back’’ with his various big speeches and efforts to ‘‘regain control of his own narrative.’’

Obama learned quickly that it was much easier to write a narrative in a campaign than in the White House. While a candidate can tell a story of his choosing, a president must react to zigzagging crises of great complexity. On a given day, he can appear passively swept along by events like a sea gull riding the surface of a rough sea. Suddenly, say, there’s a video loop all over TV of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. That became a lasting image of the Deep­water Horizon spill in 2010 and a testimonial to a president powerless to stop an environmental disaster (and those poor, helpless gulls were now soaked in oil).

The precarious state of the ‘‘Obama narrative’’ at the time was announced all over the place. The tragic condition of the national folk tale was captured in a column in The Washington Post by Jason Horowitz, now a reporter at The Times. It began thus: ‘‘Sing to me of the Obama narrative, Muse, the narrative of twists and turns driven time and again off course.’’

It is during election season that narratives become cesspools of predictable inanity. It is no longer enough for candidates to simply win or lose or be right or wrong. They must also control the narrative. Even the most incremental event of a campaign is parsed for narrative significance. Before any presidential debate, it falls upon a struggling candidate to not just perform well but also to wrest the almighty pen with which our grand drama is being composed. ‘‘Jeb Bush Needs to Flip the Narrative in Tonight’s Debate,’’ according to a headline on the website of Fox Business, which co-hosted that chapter in the rolling Republican contretemps last month in Milwaukee. The consensus afterward was that Jeb failed to do so — his narrative was left unflipped.

At the debate in Boulder a couple weeks earlier, Marco Rubio accused Hillary Clinton of lying about the nature of the 2012 attack on the United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Charlie Rose asked him to clarify his accusation the next day on ‘‘CBS This Morning,’’ and Rubio suggested that calling it a terrorist attack conflicted with the story that President Obama preferred in the last days of his re-election campaign. ‘‘The narrative of their campaign at the time, Charlie, was that Al Qaeda was on the run and had been defeated,’’ Rubio said. ‘‘That was their narrative, and this countered that narrative.’’

The narratives of 2016, in fact, began as soon as the 2012 campaign ended. That was when Rand Paul was supposed to be a force in the current race and libertarians were supposedly a great X-factor. Party leaders said they were committed to fashioning a narrative that would appeal to Hispanics and women, who have been voting overwhelmingly for Democrats in recent presidential elections.

Then came the Donald Trump narrative.

First, we were assured, per sources close to the narrative, that Trump was never serious about running for president. He was all hype, self-promotion and book jacket. That’s as far as his narrative ever would reach. Even if he did run (so went the narrative), Trump would never go anywhere. And now, after nearly four months in the lead, Trump is still sure to fizzle eventually, while Marco and Ted might be heating up and Ben and Carly might be cooling off, if they were ever really that warm to begin with.

Trump is as big a celebrity as has ever made a real run for president, yet he seemed to come from nowhere. His act was familiar, but played wholly authentic amid the turgid sameness of politics. He offered surprises and shock value. Attention-­getting itself has become its own narrative. We read screens all day, not stories. Quips, controversies and the ability to break through have become prized commodities.

It’s a wonder anyone has time for narrative anymore, because politics seems to move only in circles or news cycles. Is there really an arc or just a fat snake eating its tail? Maybe, in fact, the narrative is dead, which is why people keep invoking it all the time: to convince themselves, somehow, that the American story is really moving forward through all the noise.",REAL
Judge John Hodgman on Kids Demanding Pets,"Photo

Brooke writes: We recently had to put down our dog. I got him before I had children; now I have three. We weren’t sure we’d get another dog, but seeing my kids react to life without a pet has changed my mind. My husband disagrees.

The court’s condolences. I also recently paid a professional to poison my elderly pet (let us not mince words): in my case, a cat named Petey. Petey also predated our children. And like your children, mine, too, now demand a new animal that they will never meaningfully care for before moving out, leaving my spouse and me with this new pet until such time as we are required to poison him. Take some time to enjoy your spouse and your children without an animal’s demands or feces. Then, get a dog when your children leave home and stop answering their phone calls.",REAL
Serious Play,"Looking at Singh’s work on Instagram, I get pleasure from the pictures themselves, from their simplicity, emotional resonance and lo-fi aesthetic. And they deepen my understanding of a body of work I’ve been following for many years. I am conscious that what I am watching on Singh’s feed is a reflexive form of critique: She is using images to think about her making of images. Each photo, whether of a pair of glass jars, or a chair, or a bed, or a flower carved in marble in high relief, illuminates and is illuminated by what came before. Her photographic language accrues vocabulary while its grammar remains stable. Flowers, for example, are a new element in her work, but they fit into the larger oeuvre because of the taxonomic and repetitive way she presents them.

But sometimes, even within this stability, genuine surprise occurs. One morning, for instance, I woke up and saw that Singh had posted a brief video of Mona Ahmed, whose image I had not seen since Singh’s 2001 book, ‘‘Myself Mona Ahmed.’’ But there Ahmed was on my screen, much older now, singing with a quavering voice. Her skin was good, and her eyes glistened. She smiled through broken teeth as she sang. Because I knew the book, and what her face looked like when she was younger, and how much she had suffered, this 15-second video brought tears to my eyes.

If both Stephen Shore and Dayanita Singh are often registering evidence of a settled world, there is something more dynamic happening in Gueorgui Pinkhassov’s photography. Pinkhassov, who was born in Moscow and now lives in Paris, is one of the world’s leading photojournalists, though the label fits him badly. ‘‘Assignments are the best pretext for turning up in a new environment,’’ Pinkhassov wrote to me. ‘‘But I value myself more as an amateur than as a professional.’’ Amateur — that is the word for him, with its declaration of love for the craft. He is a camera artist in love with light, color and immediacy.

When you see an image by Pinkhassov, you recognize it. The picture plane is active with a complex scatter of light, and there is frequently a dense, dramatic skein of shadows out of which, as though by magic, coherent shapes emerge: a head here, a foot there, some shape in silhouette, fishermen’s nets, smoke, faces, some other shape in fragmentary form. After a moment, the entire ensemble becomes legible. His oneiric images always seem to be on the verge of movement, as though he made the picture while the scene was still being born, before it was fully deposited into its own reality.

Pinkhassov has taken this talent for eliciting a primordial energy from everyday life to its next logical step: He now posts short videos of similarly abstract, swirling, evolving scenes. The poetic grace and precise timing in both his published and Instagram work make sense when you consider two of his main influences: Andrei Tarkovsky (for whose film ‘‘Stalker’’ Pinkhassov was invited to shoot stills in 1979) and Henri Cartier-Bresson. He credits them both with leading him to the idea that ‘‘reality contains enough material out of which one can weave poetic images without filters.’’ But even within the parameters of a style, Pinkhassov’s images are charged with a perpetual element of surprise — he says he would rather be a ‘‘stove’’ than a ‘‘refrigerator,’’ would rather cook than keep. The effect of seeing a new picture by him, as you scroll down the Instagram feed, is often a jolt of wonder and gratitude.

Instagram, like any other wildly successful social-media platform, is by turns creative, tedious, fun and ridiculous. If you follow the wrong people, it can easily become a millstone around your neck. (There can be mild, but real, social costs to following and then unfollowing.) But the activity of individual photographers is an area in which it can be revelatory — not for the stunning individual image but for the new seams of insight it reveals. ‘‘The conversation you have with a friend you speak with every day is different from one that you have with a friend you speak with once a month or once a year’’ is how Stephen Shore put it in an email. Instagram, he says, ‘‘can have the taste of the more intimate, more perhaps seemingly trivial daily conversation.’’

Once we’ve fallen in love with an artist’s work, isn’t one of the things we most long for to get inside that artist’s head, to somehow get closer to the creative process? This is why we read interviews, it is why we look at sketchbooks, it is why we pore over contact sheets. Instagram, at its best, can replicate aspects of this directness; it can be a conversation that unfolds gradually, over weeks and months. We see how an obsession develops and not simply what it looks like once it is on the walls of a museum or between the pages of a book. One part of the thrill is knowing that it is not happening anywhere else with such intimacy or immediacy. Another is the bittersweet fact of its evanescence: Like all conversation, it happens when it happens, and when it’s gone, it’s gone.",REAL
The Swindled Samaritan,"She said she had come from Peru. She asked what I did and where I lived. You can’t imagine how charming and cute this little old lady was. We were nearing the address, and I recall having the thought that we needed to cross the street. That’s the last thing I remember from that day. After that, everything is blank.

I woke up many hours later not knowing where I was. I stayed in bed, without pillows or blankets, feeling queasy and resting for a half-hour, trying to figure out what happened. At that point, I didn’t remember the lady, but I soon realized that I was at home, even though it hardly resembled my apartment — because it was empty. Everything was gone: my com­puter, my guitar, my clothing, my jewelry, about $5,000 in pesos I had hidden under my mattress, even my shampoo. There was only the bare bed and a table.

I went downstairs to the lobby. ‘‘What happened to my stuff?’’ I asked the doorman.

‘‘Your mom came with a man and took your things away,’’ he said. I told him that was impossible because my mom was hundreds of miles away in Barranquilla, my hometown. ‘‘Let’s look at the surveillance video,’’ he said, explaining that I brought the woman by the day before. I had recently told the doorman of my plans to move, so he assumed she was my mother helping me out.

‘‘That’s not your mom?’’ he asked, standing at the video monitor and pointing to her, sounding alarmed. I still didn’t remember anything about the old woman, but then, after watching the video some more, it started to come back to me. I saw her haul my stuff out with the help of a middle-aged man, who had waited in the lobby. She was wearing one of my coats as well as an expensive pair of shoes (mine) made by a Colombian designer.

Watching the video, I saw myself come in with the woman, smiling as if everything were normal, and then I did not appear again. A doctor who checked me out later said I was given a drug nicknamed burundanga, popularly used by criminals in Colombia. He said it could have been administered through the paper the lady handed me, or perhaps some kind of aerosol. Even though my memory was wiped clean, on the video I appeared to be my everyday self.

The doorman suggested calling the police, but I didn’t want to because I knew it would be a waste of time; they couldn’t get my things back. (Colombian police officers are not known for being so helpful.) My doorman said he had heard of groups of criminals called apartamenteros, who clear out apartments. I never thought something like that would happen to me.

I called my dad, and he and my mom got on a flight to Bogotá that day. When they saw me, they both started crying. I tried to hold my tears back. They hadn’t wanted me to live by myself in Bogotá anyway because of the bad things like this that could happen. My dad tried to comfort me, saying I could always buy new stuff and the important thing was that I was O.K.

‘‘You need to come back home,’’ he also said. But I didn’t want to. We spent a few days at a hotel in Bogotá. And after a while, I realized that without any possessions, I felt free. I felt as if I could start a new life in a new country and meet new people. I decided I wanted to move to New York City for a fresh start.

My parents thought it was a terrible idea, but the following week, I closed my eyes, threw caution to the wind and went to New York. Before I left, my dad told me not to trust anybody, and not to talk to strangers. But I’m still as trusting as before. That’s how I am. I just trust anybody.

How to Prepare for an Earthquake,"Photo

‘‘Bolt heavy objects to the wall,’’ says Ross S. Stein, a geophysicist who teaches at Stanford University. Loose things cause many earthquake injuries; broken bottles cut feet, falling armoires and flying televisions break bones. So fix your bookshelves in place and hang framed art with quake-­proof mountings. Latch cupboards containing breakables like glassware. Keep a headlamp by your bed, because there will probably be a power failure. ‘‘These are the easy, cheap fixes,’’ says Stein, who studied earthquakes and their aftershocks for more than 30 years as a senior scientist with the United States Geological Survey. Last year, he introduced temblor.net, a website and app that enables users to calculate their seismic exposure.

Even in quake-­prone regions like the San Francisco Peninsula — where Stein lives, three miles from the San Andreas fault — buildings end up with fundamental vulnerabilities that require more expensive fixes. If you live near a fault, make sure your house is fastened to its foundation. Buildings tend to be cube-­shaped, and cubes, Stein says, ‘‘have no structural integrity’’: When jolted, they collapse into parallelograms. Strengthen your cube (or press your landlord to do so) with materials like crisscrossing cables or plywood bracing.

Because our homes generally aren’t built to handle shaking, Stein stores a crowbar under his bed in case he needs to jimmy a damaged door. He keeps extra propane for cooking and a solar-­powered cellphone charger. His surgical mask, work gloves and shovel are always accessible (‘‘be ready to rescue someone’’); three-­gallon bottles of distilled water are stored in his garage. Everyone in his family has an orange emergency whistle. ‘‘You can only yell for a few hours before you run out of moisture,’’ Stein says. ‘‘No one is going to dig you out unless they know you’re alive.’’",REAL

RE: FIRST WORDS

Laila Lalami explained what it’s like to live as a Muslim in the ‘‘gray zone’’ of multicultural co­existence — with extremists insisting such a thing couldn’t, or shouldn’t, be possible.

As a teacher in a multicultural middle school in north-central New Jersey that is filled with students of many religions, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, I want to thank Laila Lalami for her insightful and heartfelt account of perceptions of Muslims in our country, and I also want to tell her daughter that yes, many of us would vote for her. Hold fast to your dreams. In fact, it is her generation that will ensure that we are all rising above the ignorance, discriminatory rhetoric and behavior of extremists in the world today. When I walk down the halls of my school and witness students of diverse races, cultures and religions laughing, joking, bumping shoulders in friendly gestures and holding their heads close while listening to one another, I know this to be true. As Laila notes, ‘‘This gray life of mine is not unique.’’ There is hope that the children of the gray life will bring us to a place of understanding and peace. Sarah Hare, Hope, N.J.

Laila Lalami captured what it is like to be an outsider, sometimes judged as an ‘‘other’’ and responsible for co-religionists’ misdeeds. My family and I live in a small city with a sizable population of immigrants and children of immigrants from around the world, including many from Muslim-majority countries. We often make connections because of a shared heritage with my Moroccan-born and -raised Jewish mother, who enjoyed the music, language, culture and food of her native country. Politicians who use language designed to create a division between themselves and those who are different forget that this country was founded on people fleeing persecution and hoping for a better, freer life. We forget our long immigrant heritage when segments of the population resort to fear and nativism to advance their own goals. We are a better country than this. We should welcome strangers into our home and feel honored when they want to be part of the fabric of our integrated society, regardless of race, religion or ethnicity.

RE: TALK

Ana Marie Cox interviewed Bob Mankoff, the cartoon editor of The New Yorker and the subject of the HBO documentary ‘‘Very Semi-Serious,’’ about contemporary cartooning.

In my New York Times Magazine interview, when asked why none of the cartoonists pitching ideas in the new movie ‘‘Very Semi-Serious’’ were people of color, the necessary brevity of my answer might have left the impression that The New Yorker doesn’t see this as something that needs to be addressed. We absolutely do.

And this must be more than just being open and encouraging people of color to submit their work; it must go further, actively further, by creating a strategy of outreach to institutions where cartooning is taught. We have made a start at this in collaboration with Keith Mayerson, cartooning coordinator at the School of Visual Arts in New York. The New Yorker cartoonist Emily Flake, who appears in the film, is now teaching a course in the kind of single-panel cartoons that The New Yorker is known for; it is our hope that this will enlarge the pool of cartoonists who submit work. We also hope that this course can serve as a model for other institutions. Humor is serious business, you might say, and just as we’ve seen increasing diversity in stand-up and in films and on TV, it’s just as important to cartooning, no matter how small the universe.

Four Bodies in Elmhurst,"‘‘I gotta do what I gotta do,’’ Stack said, and then he hung up the phone. Clark called Gloria, who called the police, and then he tried the house again. Stack didn’t answer. As the answering machine recorded his message, Clark begged Stack to pick up — and not to harm himself or anyone else.

By the time the police arrived, Stack had turned his .38-caliber Smith & Wesson five-shot revolver on himself. He wrapped a towel around his own head before he pulled the trigger — as he had with Frankie, Mary and Joan — and his body lay slumped in a small ground-floor bedroom near his dead wife and son, with his daughter out on a recliner in the living room.

Before he killed himself, Stack tidied up the bodies, placing Frankie’s and Joan’s hands one over the other on their stomachs where they lay. He also made sure to retrieve the first four shell casings — one shot each for Mary and Joan, two for Frankie — and carefully deposit them in a white plastic wastebasket. He left his wallet out on a side table in the living room and important documents in a folder on top of a bureau in the master bedroom, to spare police and his surviving family the trouble of looking for them.

When the coroner, Dr. Richard Jorgensen, arrived a few hours later, he was struck by the seeming normalcy of the Stack residence. ‘‘This could be my suburban family home,’’ he told me months later. ‘‘This was a home where people who cared about their family lived.’’ Jorgensen said he could tell just from looking at Joan that she had been very ill. ‘‘I can’t imagine the burden of this family for these 50-some years,’’ he said. ‘‘I’ve heard people judge Frank in a critical way, and I think this is truly ‘Walk a mile in their moccasins before you say anything,’ because I’ve been through the house and talked to the various members of the family, and this isn’t a situation where there was anything other than love that I saw all around this place.’’

Frank Stack was a big man — 6-foot-1 and 240 pounds at the time of the shootings — and a big presence. He was a Korean War veteran, a retired Commonwealth Edison lineman, an ardent Green Bay Packers fan on a Chicago Bears block. Neighbors describe him as a kind of patriarch, the first guy they met when they moved in, always willing to lend a hand, dropping off a coffeecake he had picked up for you at the farmers’ market because he knew you were having a hard time. His neighbors acknowledge that he could be stubborn and a bit quick to lose his temper, but many viewed that as part of his charm. Joan was smaller, quieter, deeply Catholic, a ‘‘saint’’ in the eyes of those same neighbors. She kept an impeccable home, had dinner on the table every night, and always asked you how you and your family were doing, never complaining about her own lot even as she grew increasingly sick.

As Stack had gotten older, he couldn’t get around the way he used to. Bill Mueller, a friend who lived across the street for nearly 32 years, quietly began to help out with work around the house. He watched from up close as both Frank and Joan started to decline, with Joan becoming completely dependent on others because of her ill health. According to neighbors, Frank had undergone several operations for severe sciatica, but the pain had become increasingly debilitating. He and Mueller talked about putting in an electric lift to help with the stairs, but they never got around to it.

Though Stack was devoted to all of his children, he had a special bond with his only son. He saw Frankie at least once a week, taking him out for rides in the car, bringing him home for dinner or delivering a cake to the group home for him to enjoy with the staff and other residents. Frankie loved chocolate and he loved to be outside, listening to a lawn mower or taking a flower and twirling it in his fingers. He was less social than his sister, preferring to watch what everybody else was doing before deciding whether he wanted to join in himself.

Stack rode the staff hard at the Ray Graham Association, the organization that oversaw the group homes where Frankie and Mary lived, and he was particularly hard on the people who looked after Frankie. When Frankie’s eyesight grew progressively worse and a doctor discovered a detached retina, Stack became convinced that a housemate had been hitting his son in the head, despite assurance from the staff at Ray Graham that no such thing had occurred. ‘‘Frank had a side you didn’t want to get on,’’ Jane Mueller, Bill’s wife, says. ‘‘I’m sure he gave Ray Graham an earful. Frank was never happy. It was never good enough.’’ After Frankie’s eye surgery, Stack became upset that there wasn’t enough light in the living room of the group home to allow his son to recover properly.

Photo

‘‘They had very high expectations for us, and that was O.K.,’’ Kim Zoeller, the head of the Ray Graham Association, told me when I visited her at Ray Graham headquarters in nearby Lisle. She has worked for the association in various roles since 1994, and she knew the Stacks long before Frankie and Mary went into group homes. ‘‘We definitely saw a little bit — a side of Mr. Stack, when he had concerns, all from a passion for his kids,’’ she said. ‘‘He wanted us to make sure that we knew that whatever this issue is, you need to tend to it. And we wanted to know.’’

Hearing the story of the Stacks after the fact, it’s easy to assume that the parents faced, or believed they faced, an imminent crisis around continuing care for Frankie and Mary. There are waiting lists in many states of up to 10 years for the kinds of group homes that they were living in. If parents or caregivers of children with these types of disabilities die without having arranged for the care of their child, the child’s future is left to the state — which may mean an emergency placement at a group home, or at a nursing home or some other kind of bare-bones facility that might not meet the person’s needs.

But the Stacks had gotten out ahead of all of that. The financial mechanics of planning for the future of a son or daughter with disabilities are daunting and complex, but in many cases they can be managed with effort and help. There are special-needs trusts, Medicaid waiver services and second-to-die insurance policies that can be set up. The important thing is to plan, and the Stacks had: While Frankie and Mary were still living at home, they attended day programs through Ray Graham, and as Frank and Joan got older, Frank found a way through Medicaid, Medicare, his private health insurance and Supplemental Security Income (S.S.I.) to secure funding for permanent residential placement for both of them in perpetuity.

‘‘They did all the right things,’’ Zoeller said. ‘‘They very deliberately planned to make sure that Frankie and Mary had a safe and secure future.’’

All parents fear what will happen to their children when they’re gone, but that fear is understandably heightened — more challenging, more isolating, more all-encompassing — for parents of people with disabilities. Frank Stack’s emotional response to that fear, his desire to have his kids go before he did, isn’t all that uncommon. In the late ’80s, Tamar Heller, who runs the Department of Disability and Human Development at the University of Illinois at Chicago, conducted a series of focus groups throughout the state with aging caregivers of adults with disabilities. She distinctly remembers one of the fathers saying that he hoped his daughter would die four minutes before he did. ‘‘Everyone agreed around the table,’’ Heller told me, referring to the other caregivers. ‘‘And I was horrified about that.’’

Maedi Tanham Carney, a Washington-based financial planner for parents of children with special needs, acknowledges how universally difficult it is for parents of children with disabil­ities to face the reality of their own mortality. The worry, as she puts it, is ‘‘Who will be as good as me at taking care of my baby?’’ Tanham Carney herself has a daughter with intellectual disabilities who underwent two kidney transplants as a teenager but is now in much better health. She confesses that, during her darker times, she entertained the fantasy of going out with her daughter ‘‘like Thelma and Louise.’’

This may be, at least in part, a matter of control. Even plans as carefully made as those of the Stacks can go awry. In recent years, funding for programs to serve people with intellectual and developmental disabilities has been reduced in 32 states. In Illinois, Gov. Bruce Rauner proposed a budget that would slash all funding for respite care, which brings qualified caregivers into the homes of people with disabilities so that their families can go away for a weekend or have a necessary medical procedure. Families who are already struggling will have an even harder time without these supports.

Photo

And the numbers are only going to get worse. Of the roughly 5 million people in the United States living with intellectual and developmental disabilities today, around 71 percent live at home with a family caregiver; of that 71 percent, a full 25 percent — more than 860,000 people — live with a caregiver who is 60 or older. Research compiled by the Arc, one of the nation’s oldest and largest advocacy groups for people with these disabilities, suggests that two-thirds of all affected families have no plan at all for the future. As Peter Berns, the Arc’s chief executive, told me, ‘‘It’s inconceivable that the system is going to grow to serve this number of people.’’

Some people with intellectual and developmental disabilities can, in rare instances, pose real threats to their parents’ safety. Dr. Lance Clawson, a psychiatrist in Maryland who specializes in children with developmental disabilities, told me about one family who refused to move their adult son out of the house, despite the fact that he repeatedly injured them. They placed him in residential care — reluctantly — only after the aging mother had surgery and her son knocked her to the ground after she came home to recover. Andrew Solomon, the author of ‘‘Far From the Tree,’’ an influential 2012 book about families with exceptional children — from prodigies to those with autism and Down syndrome — talked to one parent whose close family members suggested that she kill her autistic child and told her that they would help her.

Donna Cohen is a psychologist and professor at the University of South Florida who studies murder-suicides, particularly among aging caregivers. She says there are three core characteristics of people who kill their spouses and children, an act clinically known as familicide. The first is that the perpetrator has a mental-health condition, which in older men often presents as depression, anxiety and a general sense of being overwhelmed by the stress of long-term caregiving. The second is that the perpetrator has a controlling personality and extraordinarily close emotional attachments to the people he is killing. Older male perpetrators tend to have a history in the military, law enforcement or other high-control occupations like engineering. And third, the perpetrator commits the crime when he perceives that there is an ‘‘unstoppable threat to the integrity of the relationship’’ with the victims — the spouse’s health is declining, or some other kind of loss of control looms. Frank Stack fit all of Cohen’s criteria, particularly as Joan’s condition deteriorated. Of the killings themselves, Cohen says: ‘‘That’s not an act of love. It’s an act of depression and desperation.’’

Berns, the Arc’s chief, is used to hearing stories about ‘‘mercy killings’’ of people with disabilities. ‘‘You can find lots of examples of parents or other caretakers killing their loved ones,’’ he says. ‘‘Those are not justifiable homicides. They are the actions of folks who have significant mental-illness problems themselves. They’re criminal. No matter how severe the challenges are, you can’t justify the behavior.’’ He thinks media coverage of these kinds of incidents tends to give the impression that the slaughter of a child with a disability is somehow tolerable. ‘‘There’s too much of a bias that their lives really don’t have value,’’ he says. ‘‘There’s some sense that they’re better dead than living.’’

After the shootings, the police pulled 10 guns out of the Stack house. They didn’t find them all at once. Three guns were lodged in the ceiling of the basement, up under the floor joists of the ground floor: a Mauser 8-millimeter Model 98 rifle, an Excel 20-gauge shotgun and a bolt-action rifle with a missing stock. A small North American Arms .22-caliber revolver was found in the master bedroom, along with a set of brand-new Peerless handcuffs, serial number 783935. In a downstairs office there were also several types of ammunition — .45 rounds, 9-millimeter rounds and the .38 PMC Silver eRange rounds that Stack used to kill his family. The police report states that both Joan and Mary were probably killed instantly, ‘‘like a light switch.’’ Frankie had been shot twice, once from farther away and then once with the muzzle of the revolver at his temple. The report describes his wounds as ‘‘fatal in nature, but possibly not instantly fatal.’’

Their neighbors knew about the guns, though maybe not how many Stack had. Peggy Babyar, who lived down the street, recalls a time when the neighborhood was being plagued by raccoons; when the trappers had trouble, Frank jokingly offered to grab a gun and handle the problem himself. It wasn’t surprising — other men in the neighborhood kept guns — and certainly not unusual for a former Marine.

Stack rarely talked about his time in the Ko­rean War, but most people who knew him were aware that he had been a Marine. Both Stack parents regarded his combat history as a possible reason for his children’s disabilities. ‘‘Joan thought it was something that happened in the war, with Frank,’’ Jane Mueller told me. ‘‘I remember talking to her about it, and she said, you know, Agent Orange in the Vietnam War — she thought it was something maybe in the Korean War that he was exposed to.’’ A staff member at Ray Graham remembers Frank saying the same thing several years ago, that he couldn’t help thinking it was something he was exposed to in the military. ‘‘I think he carried that with him all his life,’’ the staff member says.

On the day after the killings, social workers from Ray Graham went out to talk to Frankie’s and Mary’s housemates, to work through what had happened, to answer questions and make sure people felt safe. In her room at her group home in Woodridge, Mary had kept a portrait of her parents on the far wall. When one of her housemates found out what had happened to her, the first thing she did was point to the portrait and scream, through her tears: ‘‘Take it down! Take that down!’’

The scene at Frankie’s group home was even grimmer. ‘‘The men here, they took it pretty hard,’’ David Clark told me. When I asked him if things were any better nine months later, he paused and then said again, ‘‘It’s been very hard.’’

One of Frankie’s housemates, who, like Frankie, was nonverbal — somebody whom you might not expect to grasp the concept of death — immediately began to sob when Kelly Stumme, an administrator with Ray Graham, told him what had happened. ‘‘He didn’t understand the details,’’ Stumme says, ‘‘but he knew.’’ The next day, she started to receive calls from other, more verbal members of the group homes. ‘‘I’m still worried about what happened with Frankie,’’ one resident told Stumme. ‘‘Do I need to call my dad and make sure that I’m O.K. and nothing’s going to happen when I go to visit him?’’

A couple of days after Easter, I visited the home in Woodridge where Mary had been living at the time of her death. It was a rainy day, but the one-level ranch-style house was cheerful even in the gloom, with Easter Bunnies stationed along the curving walk toward the front door. The staff hadn’t known I would be coming, but everything was clean and open — a shared kitchen where the six women took their meals, a TV room looking out onto a sizable yard with a shed in back and then bedrooms and bathrooms off to the sides. I looked into, but didn’t enter, the room where Mary had lived with her longtime roommate, Kim, a double bedroom with its own bath at the back of the house. (When Mary was admitted to her first group home, in 1999, the Stacks had her eat lunch with Kim every day for a few weeks before making the move, so she could get used to it.)

A staff member showed me pictures on her phone of the residents dyeing eggs the weekend before, and then she pulled out a scrapbook of older pictures. A few pages in, there was Mary, on various field trips and outings — tall, brunette, hands up and together in front of her in what was apparently a fairly characteristic pose. I was surprised by how old she looked. The way people talk about individuals with disabilities can be so infantilizing that sometimes it’s hard to remember that 57 means 57, whatever is going on inside your head. You could tell she was different. But she looked happy.

Later we visited the day program Mary attended every weekday, at a large compound, owned by Ray Graham, which centered on a big, airy pavilion with breakout rooms radiating off to the sides. In back was a barn with chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, turkeys and a huge stable offering indoor and outdoor therapeutic horseback riding. In the atrium of the pavilion, three men were playing indoor bocce with bean bags and intense concentration, calculating final positions with a tape measure. In the kitchen, several people were getting ready to do some cooking, while others worked on an art project at the table.

One of the quieter rooms off to the side had big windows looking out onto the grass, and that’s where Mary liked to spend her time. What would she be doing here? I asked. ‘‘Looking at magazines,’’ Stumme said, smiling. Mary loved magazines. Everybody who knew her knew that. She particularly liked magazines with babies in them. She would point and say: ‘‘Baby. Mama.’’ She also liked action movies, and music. When she saw you, if she liked you, she would take your hand in hers. ‘‘She liked chairs with arms,’’ Kim Zoeller said, as we looked around the room. ‘‘That’s where she felt most comfortable.’’

It was also exactly how she died: how she felt most comfortable, in a brown leather easy chair with arms. Her father had seen to that. ‘‘A magazine was observed to be positioned in her lap,’’ the coroner’s official report read, ‘‘as if she had been reading a magazine at the time of the incident.’’

In late May, in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg — just north of the Stacks in Elmhurst — a 55-year-old woman named Bonnie Liltz, facing recovery from cancer and considerable continuing health challenges, tried to kill herself and her 28-year-old adopted daughter, Courtney, who had cerebral palsy and severe cognitive disabilities. Authorities say Liltz put an overdose of crushed-up prescription pills into Courtney’s feeding tube, then swallowed a similar dose of her own with a glass of wine. ‘‘I can’t leave my daughter behind,’’ she wrote in a suicide note. ‘‘If I go first, what will happen to her?’’ Courtney died, but her mother survived.

Liltz has since been charged with first-degree murder; she has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she faces life in prison. Before 2011, when Illinois abolished capital punishment, prosecutors could have sought the death penalty. Frank Stack might have been similarly charged had he survived. ‘‘If the evidence is there and we can prove he killed three people, regardless of his age, he would be charged,’’ Robert Berlin, the DuPage County state’s attorney, told reporters at the time of the killings. ‘‘There is no exemption: Murder is murder.’’

Every year in March, a group of disabil­ity-advocacy organizations holds a national day of mourning for people with disabilities who are killed by their caregivers; the Autistic Self Advocacy Network reports that more than 90 people with disabilities have been murdered by their parents over the last five years. According to the National Council on Disability, the general trend in these cases is that the perpetrators receive compara­tively light sentences and tend to be seen as victims of a system that doesn’t provide enough resources for children with disabilities and their families. But that wasn’t the case with the Stacks. Nor was it the case with Liltz: She had been previously urged, because of her cancer, to put Courtney in a residential-care facility, but she resisted, thinking the state could not care for her daughter properly. ‘‘In the vast majority of cases, the cause didn’t have anything to do with access to services,’’ Ari Ne’eman, the president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, says. ‘‘That’s not to say that desperation doesn’t exist, in all kinds of families. There are many who are quite legitimately desperate for services. But that’s not what makes you kill your child.’’

Violent crimes against people with disabilities have been classified as hate crimes by the federal government since 2009, but the concept of a hate crime can be hard to square with the murder of a child by a parent who — however delusional and depressed he or she might be — has often been seen as a loving and compassionate caregiver. How should we view people like Bonnie Liltz and Frank Stack? Do we — should we — judge them any differently than we do Karen McCarron, a former pathologist who is serving 36 years in Illinois for suffocating her 3-year-old autistic daughter and then trying to conceal the crime? Or Kelli Stapleton, who’s serving 10 to 22 years in Michigan for trying (and failing) to kill her violent, autistic 14-year-old daughter? Or Nyia Parler, who in April was charged with attempted murder for leaving her nonverbal, quadri­plegic 21-year-old son alone on the ground in the woods of a Philadelphia park for five days, with nothing but a blanket and a Bible, while she visited her boyfriend in Maryland?

‘‘We have reams and reams of letters from people all across the country, understanding the choice that this person had to make and the circumstances under which she made it,’’ Thomas Glasgow, the lawyer for Liltz, told me in September. There has been an outpouring of support for her, including people who don’t even know her offering to post her $10,000 bond. (Her bond was covered by her family in June.)

‘‘Each person who called had a story of their own. They understand the loneliness. They understand the desperation. They understand the feelings of abandonment,’’ Glasgow said. ‘‘And the ones that didn’t have children that ended up that way said to me, ‘Thank God that was not me or my family.’ ’’

Gloria and Barbara, the Stacks’ surviving daughters, declined to comment for this article, but on the night of the killings Gloria told a police investigator that her father had ‘‘been a saint’’ for as long as she had known him, caring for her brother and sister. The next morning, a neighbor ran into Gloria and remembers hearing her say, ‘‘My dad is the bravest man in the world.’’ Several days later, Gloria provided a statement to the media affirming her belief that her father’s actions ‘‘came from a place of love.’’ In an email declining my interview request, she referred to both of her parents as ‘‘truly amazing people.’’

There is a kind of mystery at the heart of situations like this that the criminal justice system doesn’t quite resolve, even if morally we know what the right answer is: Murder is murder. Frankie’s old housemate understood this intuitively. But even David Clark, who received the fateful phone call from Frank Stack and who loved and cared for Frankie, wasn’t willing to condemn Stack for what he did. ‘‘Looking back on it, I wish I could have done more, or said something,’’ he told me a few months ago, expressing a feeling that nearly everybody who knew the Stacks seems to have shared. ‘‘They were a loving family, and that’s the way it needs to be portrayed. No one knows why, the cause or reason. The people who actually know are no longer here.’’",REAL
The Last Dalai Lama?,"The Dalai Lama still travels energetically around the world while frequently joking about his age (‘‘Time to say, ‘Bye-bye!’ ’’). His Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts help secure his place in the contemporary whirl. But the cause of Tibet, once eagerly embraced by politicians as well as entertainers, has been eclipsed in the post-9/11 years. The world has become more interconnected, but — defined by spiraling wars, frequent terrorist attacks and the rapid rise of China — it provokes more anxiety and bewilderment than hope. The Dalai Lama himself has watched helplessly from his residence in Dharamsala, a scruffy Indian town in the Himalayan foothills, as his country, already despoiled by Mao’s Cultural Revolution, is coerced into an equally breakneck modernization program directed from Beijing.

The economic potency of China has made the Dalai Lama a political liability for an increasing number of world leaders, who now shy away from him for fear of inviting China’s wrath. Even Pope Francis, the boldest pontiff in decades, report­edly declined a meeting in Rome last December. When the Dalai Lama dies, it is not at all clear what will happen to the six million Tibetans in China. The Chinese Communist Party, though officially atheistic, will take charge of finding an incarnation of the present Dalai Lama. Indoctrinated and controlled by the Communist Party, the next leader of the Tibetan community could help Beijing cement its hegemony over Tibet. And then there is the 150,000-strong community of Tibetan exiles, which, increasingly politically fractious, is held together mainly by the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan poet and activist Tenzin Tsundue, who has disagreed with the Dalai Lama’s tactics, told me that his absence will create a vacuum for Tibetans. The Dalai Lama’s younger brother, Tenzin Choegyal, was more emphatic: ‘‘We are finished once His Holiness is gone.’’

The Tibetan feeling of isolation and helplessness has a broad historical basis. By late 1951, as many of Europe’s former colonies in Asia and Africa were aspiring to become nation-states, China’s People’s Liberation Army occupied Tibet. Not long after, giant posters of Mao Zedong appeared in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, the seat of the Dalai Lama, traditionally the most powerful leader of the Gelugpa order of Tibetan Buddhism and the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet.

Previous Dalai Lamas held political authority over a vast state — twice the size of France — that covered half of the Tibetan plateau and was supported by an intricate bureaucracy and tax system. But the Chinese Communists claimed that Tibet had a long history as a part of the Chinese mother­land. In truth, a complex and fluid relationship existed for centuries between Tibet’s Dalai Lamas and China’s imperial rulers. In the early 1950s, the Tibetans, under their very young leader, the current Dalai Lama, failed to successfully press their claims to independence. Nor could they secure any significant foreign support. India, newly liberated from British rule, was trying to develop close relations with China, its largest Asian neighbor. The United States was too distracted by the Korean War to pay much attention to cries of help from Tibet.

The Dalai Lama had little choice but to capitulate to the Chinese and affirm China’s sovereignty over Tibet. In return, he was promised autonomy and allowed to retain a limited role as the leader of the Tibetan people. He traveled to Beijing in 1954 to meet Mao Zedong and was impressed by Communist claims to social justice and equality.

But the Chinese program to uproot ‘‘feudal serfdom’’ in Tibet soon provoked resentment. In 1956, armed rebellion erupted in eastern Tibet. By then, the Central Intelligence Agency had spotted Tibet’s potential as a base of subversion against Communist China. The Dalai Lama’s second-oldest brother, Gyalo Thondup, helped the C.I.A. train Tibetan guerrillas in Colorado, among other places, and parachute them back into Tibet. Almost all of these aspiring freedom fighters were caught and executed. (Gyalo Thondup now accuses American cold warriors of using the Tibetans to ‘‘stir up trouble’’ with China.) China’s increasingly brutal crackdown led to a big anti-Chinese uprising in Lhasa in 1959. Its failure forced the Dalai Lama to flee.

He made a perilous crossing of the Himala­yas to reach India, where he repudiated his previ­ous agreement with Beijing and established a government in exile. The Dalai Lama quickly warmed to his new home — India was revered in Tibet as the birthplace of Buddhism — and adopted Mahatma Gandhi as an inspiration. But his Indian hosts were wary of him. Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian prime minister, was committed to building a fraternal association with Chinese leaders. He dismissed the Dalai Lama’s plan for independence as a fantasy. The C.I.A. ceased its sponsorship of the Tibetans in exile around the time that Richard Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, reached out to Mao Zedong in the early 1970s. Though Western diplomatic support for the Dalai Lama rose after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, it declined again. By 2008, Britain was actually apologizing for not previously recognizing Tibet as part of China.

The Tibetan homeland, meanwhile, has been radically remade. The area once controlled by the Dalai Lama and his government in Lhasa is now called the Tibet Autonomous Region, although roughly half of the six million Tibetans in China live in provinces adjoining it. The Chinese have tried extensive socioreligious engineering in Tibet. In 1995, Chinese authorities seized the boy the Dalai Lama identified as the next Panchen Lama, the 11th in a distinguished line of incarnate lamas. The Chinese then installed their own candidate, claiming that the emperors of China in Beijing had set up a system to select religious leaders in Tibet. (The whereabouts of the Dalai Lama-nominated Panchen Lama are a state secret in China. It is possible that, if freed from captivity, he would follow the example of the Karmapa, a lama who represents another Buddhist tradition in Tibet, who, though officially recognized by the Chinese authorities, escaped to India in 1999.)

Chinese authorities claim that Tibet, helped by government investments and subsidies, has enjoyed a faster G.D.P. growth rate than all of China. Indeed, Beijing has brought roads, bridges, schools and electricity to the region. In recent years, it has connected the Tibetan plateau to the Chinese coast by a high-altitude railway. But this project of modernization has had ruinous consequences. The glaciers of the Tibetan plateau, which regulate the water supply to the Indus, Brahmaputra, Mekong, Salween, Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, were already retreating because of global warming and are now melting at an alarming rate, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions. Lhasa, the forbidden city of legend, is a sprawl of Chinese-run karaoke bars, massage parlors and gambling dens. The pitiless logic of economic growth — which pushed Tibetan nomads off their grasslands, brought Han Chinese migrants into Tibet’s cities and increased rural-urban inequality — has induced a general feeling of disempowerment.

In recent decades, Tibetan monks and nuns have led demonstrations against Chinese rule. The Communist Party has responded with heavy-handed measures, including: martial law; forced resettlement of nomads; police stations inside monasteries; and ideological re-education campaigns in which dissenters endlessly repeat statements like ‘‘I oppose the Dalai clique’’ and ‘‘I love the Communist Party.’’ Despair has driven more than 140 people, including more than two dozen Buddhist monks and nuns, to the deeply un-Buddhist act of public suicide.

As if in response to these multiple crises in his homeland, the Dalai Lama has embarked on some improbable intellectual journeys. In 2011, he renounced his role as the temporal leader of the Tibetan people and declared that he would focus on his spiritual and cultural commitments. Today, the man who in old photos of Tibet can be seen enacting religious rites wearing a conical yellow hat — in front of thangkas, or scrolls, swarming with scowling monsters and copulating deities — speaks of going ‘‘beyond religion’’ and embracing ‘‘secular ethics’’: principles of selflessness and compassion rooted in the fundamental Buddhist notion of interconnectedness.

Increasingly, the Dalai Lama addresses himself to a nondenominational audience and seems perversely determined to undermine the authority of his own tradition. He has intimated that the next Dalai Lama could be female. He has asserted that certain Buddhist scriptures disproved by science should be abandoned. He has suggested — frequently, during the months that I saw him — that the institution of the Dalai Lama has outlived its purpose. Having embarked in the age of the selfie on a project of self-abnegation, he is now flirting with ever-more-radical ideas. One morning at his Dharamsala residence in May this year, he told me that he may one day travel to China, but not as the Dalai Lama.

The Dalai Lama lives in a heavily guarded hilltop compound in the Dharamsala suburb known as McLeod Ganj. Outsiders are rarely permitted into his private quarters, a two-story building where he sleeps and meditates. But it is not difficult to guess that he enjoys stunning views of the Kangra Valley to the south and of eternally snowy Himalayan peaks to the north. The cawing of crows in the surrounding cedar forest punctuates the chanting from an adjacent temple. Any time of day, you can see aging Tibetan exiles with prayer wheels and beads recreating one of Lhasa’s most famous pilgrim circuits, which runs around the Potala Palace, the 17th-century, thousand-room residence that the Dalai Lama left behind in 1959 and has not seen since.

To reach the modest reception hall where the Dalai Lama meets visitors, you have to negotiate a stringent security cordon; the Indian government, concerned about terrorists international and domestic, gives the Dalai Lama its highest level of security. There is usually a long wait before he shuffles in, surrounded by his translator and aides.

I first saw the Dalai Lama in the dusty North Indian town Bodh Gaya in 1985, four years before he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Speaking without notes for an entire day, he explicated, with remarkable vigor, arcane Buddhist texts to a small crowd at the site of the Buddha’s enlightenment. Thirty years later, at our first meeting, in May of last year, he was still highly alert; a careful listener, he leaned forward in his chair as he spoke. When I asked him about the spate of self-immolations by Buddhist monks in Tibet, he looked pained.

‘‘Desperation,’’ he replied. But the important thing, he stressed, was that the self-immolators do not harbor hatred for the Chinese. ‘‘They can also kill a few people with them,’’ he said, ‘‘but they are nonviolent.’’

He then quickly reminded me that he had renounced his political responsibilities, ending a four-century-old tradition according to which the Dalai Lama exercised political as well as spiritual authority over Tibetans. As part of his democratic reforms, an elected leader of the Tibetan government in exile now looks after temporal matters; he also deals with diplomatic and geopolitical issues. ‘‘My concern now,’’ the Dalai Lama said, ‘‘is preservation of Tibetan culture.’’

He told me that he was not against mod­erni­za­tion. For instance, the high-altitude railway from the Chinese coast to Tibet could bring all kinds of benefits to Tibetans. It depended on what the Chinese intended to achieve. Then, pointing a finger at me, he said, ‘‘Perhaps, also to strike fear in Indian hearts!’’ and began to laugh.

I laughed, too, though I was slightly discon­certed by his quick alternation between seriousness and levity. I was to discover over the next months that proximity to the Dalai Lama, his weirdly egoless but world-historical solidity, provokes unease, bewilderment and skepticism, as well as admiration. He embodies an ancient spiritual and philosophical tradition that enjoins a suspicion of the individual self and its desires, and stresses ethical duties over political and economic rights. At the same time, he represents — and cannot but represent, despite his recent avowals — a stateless people in a world defined by nation-states, pursuing those very interests and rights. The Dalai Lama’s life can seem one long, heroic effort to resolve the contradictions of being both a committed monk and a reluctant politician.

Born Lhamo Dhondup in a family of farmers in the northeastern Tibetan province Amdo, he was 2 when a search party of monks identified him in 1937 as the reincarnation of the re­cently deceased 13th Dalai Lama. Taken from his mud-and-stone house to the Potala Palace, he had barely assumed full political authority when the P.L.A. invaded Tibet.

It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Tibetans were killed in the 1950s and ’60s, and the Communists who destroyed Tibet’s temples and monasteries were as ferocious, by all accounts, as the iconoclasts of radical Islam are today. Yet the Dalai Lama appears wholly untouched by bitterness and self-pity — the sense of victimhood that fuels many contemporary battles for territory, resources and dignity.

Indeed, even as he seems the paragon of saintly forgiveness, he advances a claim to ordinariness. ‘‘I am a human being like any other,’’ I heard him repeat in several public appearances over the last year. In Tibet, he told me, too many superstitious beliefs had overlaid Buddhism’s commitment to empirically investigate the workings of the mind. Tibetans believed that he ‘‘had some kind of miracle power,’’ he said. ‘‘Nonsense!’’ he thundered. ‘‘If I am a living god, then how come I can’t cure my bad knee?’’

He similarly asserted his nonsupernatural qualities at the summit meeting of Nobel Peace Prize winners in Rome this December. When the city’s former mayor asked him how he coped with jet lag, the Dalai Lama, Newsweek reported, gave a frankly nonreligious explanation. He could train his mind to sleep well, he said (he goes to bed at 7 p.m. and wakes at 3 a.m. to meditate). ‘‘Traveling the world — time difference — no problem,’’ he added, ‘‘but bowel movement does not obey my mind. But this morning, thanks to your blessings — after 7 o’clock, full evacuation. So now I am very comfortable.’’

The Dalai Lama works hard to establish a sense of intimacy with his listeners, usually by goading and teasing them. At Princeton last fall, he gave a talk on secular ethics to more than 4,000 students and staff members while sporting the university’s orange cap (droll headgear often leads his attempts at informality). He broke often into his conversation-stopping laughs. His audience, not accustomed to his rapid swings between mirth and thoughtfulness, remained largely earnest.

A solemn hush fell when a student asked the Dalai Lama for the key to happiness. The Dalai Lama seemed to ponder the question. And then in his noun-stressing baritone he declaimed:

‘‘Money!’’

‘‘Sex!’’

The crowd, misled by his meaningful pause, was again slow to catch up with the Dalai Lama, who had thrown his head back and started on one of his long and deep laughs. Asked for his views on investment banking, he repeated three of his favorite words, ‘‘I don’t know.’’ In order to answer the question, he said, he would have to work for a year in an investment bank. Then, with excellent timing, he added, ‘‘With that high salary!’’

Facing eclectic audiences — atheists and Muslims, hedge-funders and Indian peasants, the American Enterprise Institute and left-wing activists — he makes no attempt to appease. He often informs conservative audiences in America, ‘‘I am Marxist’’ (and he is one — at least in his critique of inequality). He has also declared himself a true jihadi in his everyday struggle against ‘‘destructive emotions.’’ In Washington this February, he told a startled group of American Muslims that ‘‘George Bush is my friend,’’ before revealing that he wrote to him immediately after 9/11 pleading for a measured response and later chided him for prolonging the cycle of violence.

The scale of the Dalai Lama’s loss and displacement primes you for a more recognizably human reaction than this endless conciliation: Tibet should remain part of China; today’s enemies are tomorrow’s friends; all existence is deeply interconnected; and the other homilies that form part of his ‘‘secular ethics.’’ And while you certainly don’t expect the Dalai Lama to match his description by Chinese functionaries — one apparatchik memorably characterized him as ‘‘a wolf wrapped in robes, a monster with a human face and an animal’s heart’’ — even those who agree with Desmond Tutu that he is ‘‘for real’’ cannot fail to acknowledge his failure as a political negotiator.

The Dalai Lama’s readiness to compromise has not prompted more concessions from the Chinese. Tibet — rich in minerals (copper, zinc, iron ore) and the site of several nuclear missile bases — may simply be too valuable a territory for the Chinese to barter away to a powerless monk. The Tibetan diaspora, denied the rights of citizenship in India, has fragmented, spreading out from its Indian base into Europe and North America. Some of its members have long criticized the Dalai Lama’s decision to settle for autonomy within China rather than full independence, a demand he publicly abandoned in the late 1980s. More militant sectarian divisions have also opened up. The Dalai Lama is stalked wherever he goes these days by drumbeating protesters shouting, ‘‘False Dalai Lama, stop lying!’’ They belong to the International Shugden Community, part of a Buddhist sect that accuses the Dalai Lama of ostracizing worshipers of the deity in Tibetan mysticism known as Dorje Shugden, as well as, more bizarre, of being a Muslim.

And the Dalai Lama’s willingness to settle for ‘‘genuine autonomy’’ within China — an enhanced Tibetan hand in policies that affect Tibetans’ education, religion, environmental conditions and demographics — has failed to convince the Chinese that he is not a ‘‘splittist,’’ or secessionist. Formal talks between the Dalai Lama and China, which were renewed in 2001, went nowhere before ending in 2010. Informal discussions continue, and there is talk, much of it from the Dalai Lama, of his making a pilgrimage to Mount Wutai, a Buddhist site in China. There is a broad hope among the Tibetan establishment that such a visit could pave the way for the Dalai Lama’s permanent return to Tibet. In the final paragraph of his memoirs, ‘‘The Noodle Maker of Kalimpong,’’ Gyalo Thondup, a longstanding emissary between the Dalai Lama and Chinese leaders, recounts a meeting in which his younger brother urges him to stay healthy. ‘‘We have to return home together,’’ the Dalai Lama says. It seems more likely, however, that China will wait for the Dalai Lama to die in exile rather than risk his politically fraught return home.

The prospect of a world without the Dalai Lama has created a new set of quandaries for the Tibetan community in exile, even as it still looks to him for guidance. A decade ago, I visited Dharamsala to research an article for this magazine about young Tibetans disaffected with the Dalai Lama’s leadership. They belonged to the 35,000-member Tibetan Youth Congress, a traditional advocacy group for independence. At the time, the most prominent among this new generation of Tibetan activists was the poet Tenzin Tsundue. He staged protests in Indian cities during state visits by Chinese premiers and was subsequently barred by the police from traveling in India. Lately, though, the pressures on him have come not from the Indian government, Tenzin Tsundue told me, but from the Tibetan establishment in Dharamsala, which discounts Tibetans demanding independence as ‘‘anti-Dalai Lama.’’ In Tenzin Tsundue’s assessment, the Dalai Lama is trying hard to signal to the Chinese that he speaks for all Tibetans in his bid for autonomy: ‘‘ ‘Independence is impossible,’ he has said. ‘Why should someone waste his or her energy on insisting on independence?’ ’’ Tenzin Tsundue told me that the T.Y.C. had split under the weight of this official disapproval.

The current president of the youth congress, Tenzing Jigme, is a rock musician who spent 15 years in the United States. I met him at the Moonpeak Cafe in Dharamsala. On the winding road before us, narrowed by carts vending turquoise and coral jewelry, was the cosmopolitan multitude that every visiting journalist rhapsodizes about: crimson-robed monks, longhaired travelers on motorcycles, Tibetan women in brightly striped chubas, Sikh day-trippers, Kashmiri carpet-sellers and English, German and Israeli backpackers. But the adventure of globalism, it emerged from my conversation with Tenzing Jigme, had curdled here no less than in Lhasa. Dharamsala receives fewer seekers of Eastern wisdom from the West than it did a decade ago. Mindfulness is now commonly accepted as a boost to corporate effi­ciency. And Indian real estate speculators seem to be thinking differently by covering the hills around the Dalai Lama’s residence with cement.

The flow of refugees from Tibet, once running into the thousands, has slowed to a trickle. Many exiles have returned to Tibet, where urban and rural incomes have risen. And life for ordinary Tibetans in Dharamsala remains a struggle. They still cannot own property, and an increasing number hope to emigrate to the West. (Many of the young T.Y.C. activists I interviewed in 2005 have scattered across the world.) The United States is a favored destination; some Tibetans are doing very well there, but many have ended up working as dishwashers and janitors. Others became vulnerable to visa racketeers.

Among the elite, accusations of corruption and nepotism have further roiled the close-knit Tibetan exile community. In the latest scandal, Gyalo Thondup accused his sister-in-law’s father of siphoning off the Tibetan government in exile’s gold and silver. His sister-in-law denied the accusations in a widely circulated Facebook post.

Tenzing Jigme did not blame the Dalai Lama for these setbacks. In fact, he credited him with ‘‘the democratic shift in the community,’’ the advent of elected leaders. ‘‘He keeps preparing us for the future,’’ he said. But there was no doubt, he added, that the Tibetans faced a political impasse. The possibility that many would lapse into violence after the Dalai Lama dies had only grown.

One institution that hopes to forestall this bleak future is the Tibetan government in exile, now known as the Central Tibetan Administration. At the Dalai Lama’s residence this spring, I met with Lobsang Sangay, who in 2011 was elected the political head of the C.T.A. An imposing figure in his late 40s, Lobsang Sangay is the first Tibetan to attend Harvard Law School, and also the first nonmonk to rise high in the Tibetan hierarchy. Once a member of the youth congress and an advocate of independence, he now performs the delicate job of emphasizing the advantages of the ‘‘middle way’’ — autonomy under Chinese rule.

He was more sanguine than Tenzing Jigme, even buoyant, and seemed invested in old-style realpolitik. A year ago, he told me that he hoped the new Indian government of assertive Hindu nationalists would stand up to China. This expectation seemed to have been fueled, at least in part, by the Tibetan community’s diplomatic setbacks in the West. The Dalai Lama was scheduled to visit Oslo in May 2014 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his Nobel Peace Prize, but even the president of Norway’s Parliament, who once headed its pro-Tibet committee, declined to meet him. Lobsang Sangay was incredulous. ‘‘This is in Norway, an oil-rich country! It is clear that China wants the West to kowtow.’’

When I saw him again in late May this year, Lobsang Sangay said he hoped China would learn from its struggles with growing anti-mainland-Chinese sentiment in Taiwan and Hong Kong and reconsider its policy in Tibet. This seems a common expectation among the Tibetan establishment, though it is not much shared outside it. The Dalai Lama told me that the Chinese ‘‘are facing a kind of dilemma.’’ In Tibet, ‘‘they tried their best to obliterate, like Tiananmen event, but they failed.’’

In the meantime, it was imperative, Lobsang Sangay told me, for Tibetans to remain united. Tibetans, he said, needed to keep in mind four key points: survive, sustain, strengthen and succeed. Briskly, Lobsang Sangay sketched a vision in which Tibetans grow richer and more resourceful through private entrepreneurship. He said, ‘‘Mahatma Gandhi, after all, received blank checks for his activism from big Indian businessmen.’’

The C.T.A.’s previous leader, a senior Buddhist monk named Lobsang Tenzin but better known as Samdhong Rinpoche, also insists on the middle way with the Chinese and is also a self-professed Gandhian. (He is one of the Dalai Lama’s closest political advisers.) Only Tenzin Choegyal, the Dalai Lama’s younger brother and the most influential of his relatives, dissents from the establishment line. T.C., as he is known, is robustly skeptical of both C.T.A. leaders. ‘‘Lobsang Sangay,’’ he said, ‘‘is already preparing for his next election.’’ Samdhong Rinpoche, he told me, was too rigid.

T.C. trained as a monk — he was discovered to be a rinpoche, or incarnate lama — before relinquishing his robes; his bold public statements have made him the enfant terrible of the Tibetan community in exile. Autonomy, he told a French newspaper recently, would give the Tibetans one foot in their homeland. They would then use the other foot to kick out the Chinese. The Chinese media quickly seized upon these remarks as proof of the Dalai Lama’s perfidious ‘‘splittism.’’

I first met T.C. in February this year, at one of the Dalai Lama’s freewheeling public talks on secular ethics in Basel. Thousands of people — some Tibetans, but a majority of them Europeans — packed the St. Jakobshalle. The Dalai Lama sat on the stage with Basel’s mayor, who looked very awkward wearing a Tibetan khatag over his suit. The Dalai Lama repeated many of the things I heard him say at other venues: It was up to the young to strive for peace in the new century. If that seemed unrealistic, then they should ‘‘forget about it.’’ ‘‘My generation,’’ he said, ‘‘is 20th century. Our time is gone. Time to say, ‘Bye-bye.’ ’’ Asked during the Q. and A. if he planned to reincarnate, the Dalai Lama boomed, ‘‘No!’’ Abruptly, he leaned toward his interpreter and asked in Tibetan, ‘‘What is the topic of this talk?’’

T.C. turned to me and murmured, ‘‘His Holiness is getting more forgetful with age!’’

A dead ringer for his brother, with the same high cheekbones, sharp eyes and kindly expression, T.C. speaks English with an Anglo-Indian lilt, a result of his boarding-school education and stint in the Indian military. As the Dalai Lama spoke, T.C. grew gloomier. He was convinced the Tibetans had no future. Tibetans were far from secure in India; they could be asked to leave any time by the Indian government. The various incarnate lamas in exile who made money off gullible Westerners were sectarian at heart, as were the Shugden. He did see some signs of hope, however. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, was supposedly rethinking his stance on Tibet. The Dalai Lama had enjoyed friendly relations with his father in Beijing. Also, Xi’s wife is Buddhist and has visited Lhasa. Did I know that the wife of a senior Chinese leader had an affair with a restaurant owner there?

I did not. I remarked on the number of Tibetans in Basel. (Tibetans began to settle in Switzerland in the 1960s.) Many of the volunteers controlling the crowd in the arena, I learned, were hedge-funders and bankers. One of them turned out to be T.C.’s own son. In general, T.C. said, the small Tibetan diaspora had flourished in their host societies.

Cut off from both Tibet and Dharamsala, the Tibetans in the West can be extra-zealous in their devotion to their cherished leader. During the Q. and A., a member of Shugden was able to say no more than ‘‘Millions of Shugden people — ’’ before Tibetan volunteers snatched away his microphone and quickly bundled him out of sight. The Dalai Lama went on to explain his position yet again, which is, broadly, that he had not banned but merely expressed his disapproval of the Shugden deity. I told T.C. that it would have been better to let the Shugden member speak. T.C. agreed. Shugden members, he said, ‘‘want His Holiness to lose his cool. But it won’t happen.’’

For two days, Basel was enlivened by thousands of Tibetan expatriates in brilliant crimson sashes and brocade jackets. They waited for the Dalai Lama outside his hotel, keeping warm in the bone-chilling cold by singing and dancing, their exuberant drums drowning out the Shugden protesters chanting, ‘‘False Dalai Lama, stop lying!’’

Inside the arena one evening, the Dalai Lama started his speech with an effort to reconcile his audience to their displacement. He confessed that the last time he traveled there, he promised he would be in Tibet soon. But Switzerland was also ‘‘the land of the snows.’’ And, he added, ‘‘it feels like I am there. We are all from the land of the snows, not just those who were born in Tibet but also those born here.’’

He then gave a pep talk of sorts. Tibetans should be proud of themselves, he said. They and their culture were now respected all over the world. Modern science was validating the insights of Tibetan Buddhism and confirming Tibetan medicine’s assumptions about the indivisibility of body and mind. Millions of Chinese were also attracted to Tibetan Buddhism. But it was important for Tibetans not to grow complacent, to preserve their ‘‘moral culture of compassion.’’

By the time the Dalai Lama left the arena, making his way through the large assembly of Tibetans — chatting, holding hands, bumping foreheads with babies — most people had moist eyes. The Tibetans gathered here were the Dalai Lama’s devoted people, those he had held together and led, Moses-like, into the modern world. His speech made clear that, to him, Tibet had become more than a geographical and political entity; it was now a noble idea, a different way of being in the world. Its fulfillment did not require political sovereignty, let alone nationalist passion. It could be realized in any part of the world and was available to anyone, Tibetan or not.

Cynics might argue that the Dalai Lama has lapsed into a woolly internationalism; others, that his motives are pragmatic: He must constantly improvise to appear conciliatory to the Chinese, on whom Tibet’s future depends. (As Tenzin Tsundue told me, the Dalai Lama has lately invested his faith in Xi Jinping. But Xi has only hardened his stance on Tibet. So now the Dalai Lama says that ‘‘many Chinese are Buddhists, and will bring change in China.’’)

But neither cynicism nor pragmatism entirely explains his stance. It may be that he is trying to actualize the insights he has gathered as a global nomad in his post-Tibet existence — that he has transmuted his own homelessness into a vision of freedom that accords with the Buddhist emphasis on change and impermanence. Over the previous months he had expressed various versions of a drastic prospect: The institution of the Dalai Lama had outlived its purpose, he said. ‘‘If it is not needed, then do away with it.’’

A few months after we met in Basel, I went to see T.C. at his secluded hillside home in Dharamsala, a 15-minute walk from the Dalai Lama’s residence. A modern two-story building, it overlooks the British-built bungalow where the Dalai Lama’s mother used to live and which is now a guesthouse. Sitting in his book-lined study, T.C. seemed more despondent than he did in Basel. There had been, he reported, no initiative on Tibet from Xi Jinping, and early signs from India’s Hindu nationalist government were alarming. ‘‘I am really scared,’’ he said. An August 2014 meeting between the Dalai Lama and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, was a cloak-and-dagger affair. The Dalai Lama was ushered into the prime minister’s official residence in Delhi at night, and in secret. ‘‘As if His Holiness is some kind of criminal,’’ T.C. said indignantly. Modi then proceeded to ask ‘‘insulting’’ questions: Why, for instance, was the Dalai Lama organizing a meeting of religious leaders in Delhi?

‘‘As a Tibetan,’’ T.C. said, ‘‘I am very hurt over this.’’ The Dalai Lama had been for decades the ‘‘best ambassador’’ for India, publicizing the virtues of Indian philosophy and culture. T.C. was also mortified by his elder brother Gyalo Thondup’s book and its denunciation of the Tibetan establishment. ‘‘Why write a book like that?’’ The Tibetan elites were already floundering. ‘‘You look at our directors and ministers; they are not spiritually grounded.’’

T.C. spoke for a bit on what seems his favorite subject: the ills of organized religion, as distinct from private spirituality. The Dalai Lama system, too, was ‘‘pretty reactionary.’’ He then added, ‘‘Tell His Holiness that I said this.’’

When I arrived at the Dalai Lama’s residence the next morning, those waiting for an audience lined the long driveway: Mongolian monks, Swedish backpackers and recently arrived Tibetan refugees. Flanked by a retinue that I had come to recognize — two close aides, a translator, a senior monk or two, bodyguards — the Dalai Lama patiently, even energetically, clasped their hands and posed for photos.

He chuckled when I told him that his younger brother thought his high office was past its sell-by date. Then, quickly becoming serious, he added that all religious institutions, including the Dalai Lama, developed in feudal circumstances. Corrupted by hierarchical systems, they began to discriminate between men and women; they came to be compromised by such cultural spinoffs as Sharia law and the caste system. But, he said, ‘‘time change; they have to change. Therefore, Dalai Lama institution, I proudly, voluntarily, ended.’’",REAL
Feast in the Heart of Texas,"Preparations for the meal began the day before, out at the ruins of the old Hot Wells resort south of the city center, where an artist named Justin Parr has taken up residence and built an extensive garden near the capped sulfur spring. Watson picked serrano and jalapeño peppers there, dozens of tiny, sweet Texas cherry tomatoes, sprigs of Malabar spinach. Sirens wailed in the urban distance, which seemed very far away.

It was just a short drive, though, to La Michoacana, a Mexican strip-mall market with outlets across San Antonio. Watson bought avocados and bottles of Big Red, the supersweet Texas soda, and packet after packet of Mexican herbs and spices. To his basket he added dried avocado leaves, to impart a faint anise flavor to the goat; cumin and coriander; dried guajillo peppers; bags of tomatillos; dozens and dozens of limes.

Next stop: Hung Phong Oriental Market, which a local Vietnamese family opened in the early 1980s, after arriving in San Antonio as refugees and taking up residence in a home rented for them by St. David’s Episcopal Church. Watson is a regular at the store, and he was greeted warmly as he bought fish sauce and pickled green peppercorns, lemongrass, palm sugar, the Vietnamese herb known as rau ram, shrimp paste, Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise and a box of fermented Burmese tea leaves.

A bird flew lazily through the store as Watson shopped and nearly crashed into a large selection of paper lanterns, electric candles and stacks of joss paper, the fake money and ephemera used for burnt offerings to the dead in some Asian religious practices.

A San Antonio Feast Ten recipes from Sam Sifton's meal with the chef Quealy Watson.

‘‘There’s a lot of cool, sacrilegious stuff you can do with those things,’’ Watson said, in passing. Dobbertin, whose mother is Chinese, laughed. ‘‘Look at Hot Joy,’’ she said. The restaurant’s walls are decorated with the paper. Her mother, she said, does not like to sit near it.

Hot Joy was quiet that evening — the Spurs were playing, which kills business in every corner of the city. Watson checked in with his cooks, the manager, the bartender, a few patrons, then grabbed his goat and the ducks from the walk-in refrigerator and took them home.

He examined his notebook, small and black and crumpled. It held not just his plans for the coming feast but all his recipe ideas, back to the ones he sketched out for the opening of Hot Joy last year. The shopping list was basically complete. There were only chips and tortillas to pick up from Sanitary Tortilla in the morning — flour and corn — and cases of Lone Star beer.

Back at the house on the river, the Davidson children were gathering pecans that had fallen from the trees that surround their lawn, for pie. The next day, Dobbertin and Josie Davidson, as she is known, would prepare the table and mix up the drinks. All Watson would need to do was cook.

He made a kind of Mex-Asian salsa in the morning, a version of the Thai dipping sauce known as jaew, bright with roasted tomatillos and made funky with fish sauce, and a pico de gallo scented with rau ram and still more fish sauce. He made guacamole studded with pickled green peppercorns and used a food processor to whiz together the Japanese mayonnaise with canned chipotle peppers and a dollop of shrimp paste.

The Playlist San Antonio sounds straight from our friend John Spong of Texas Monthly.

For crunch, there was slaw, Burmese in style: shredded savoy cabbage mixed with fermented tea leaves and mint, in a dressing of shallots, garlic and an immense amount of lime juice. And for dessert, pecan pies sweetened with palm sugar — brown sugar’s rounder, more full-flavored Southeast Asian cousin. They baked in the Davidsons’ second oven as Watson stared morosely at the one that held the goat.

He busied himself with an appetizer, a platter of chips and queso — melted Velveeta cheese amped up with cream and sambal oelek, the ground Indonesian chile sauce — to serve on the porch with margaritas and beer. After pulling the pies from the oven, he wrapped the tortillas first in paper and then in foil, and set them in the oven to warm.

People were starting to arrive by then, striding into the kitchen with bottles of bourbon and wine, greeting Watson effusively in their cowboy boots and party skirts. Josie Davidson hustled everyone out to the porch. Watson decided it was time to face facts. He opened the door to the oven holding his goat, pulled it out and placed it on the kitchen counter. ‘‘Now we’ll know,’’ he said, and unwrapped the back legs. The meat tore perfectly from the bone, soft and pliant, smoky and rich.

‘‘This’ll be a good party,’’ Watson said. There was sweat on his brow, but his hands were no longer shaking.

And it was, as guests picked meat and layered it into the warm tortillas, dressed it with the slaw, anointed it with the salsas, poured prosecco and began to eat. A feast always will be, so long as you plan and adapt, for and with friends. The main event need not be a whole-roasted goat (though, oh, man, is it good). You could make a similar meal out of pork butt, trays of shredded chicken, vats of chili or beans. Cook what you love, serve it and watch as conversation bubbles happily as darkness rises and, if you’re lucky, lights start to twinkle in the trees.

Watson was smiling broadly by then, his arm draped over Dobbertin’s shoulders as he drained a beer. ‘‘This is how we do it in Texas,’’ he said.

White Debt,"Twenty years later, I tried to watch a video of a black man being shot in the head by a University of Cincinnati campus police officer. I didn’t want to see it, but then I thought of Emmett Till’s mother asking the country to see her son’s body and mourn with her, so I searched for the video. But I didn’t get past the first frame, because the Chicago Tribune website ran an Acura commercial after I hit play, and the possibility that the shooting death of Samuel DuBose in his old Honda was serving as an opportunity to sell Acuras made me close the window. With the long, slow pan across the immaculate interior of a new car on my mind, I reconsidered the justice behind my own encounter with a campus police officer.

The word ‘‘privilege,’’ composed of the Latin words for private and law, describes a legal system in which not everyone is equally bound, a system in which the law that makes graffiti a felony does not apply to a white college student. Even as the police spread photos of my handiwork in front of me, I could tell by the way they pronounced ‘‘tagging’’ that it wasn’t a crime invented for me. I was subject less to the law as it was written than I was to the private laws of whiteness. When the laws that bind a community apply differently to different members of the community, as Bettina Bergo and Tracey Nicholls write in their 2015 collection of essays, ‘‘I Don’t See Color,’’ then privilege ‘‘undermines the solidarity of the community.’’ And that, in turn, undermines us all.

‘‘The Condition of Black Life is One of Mourning’’ is the title of an essay Claudia Rankine wrote for The New York Times Magazine after the Charleston church massacre. Sitting with her essay in front of me, I asked myself what the condition of white life might be. I wrote ‘‘complacence’’ on a blank page. Hearing the term ‘‘white supremacist’’ in the wake of that shooting had given me another occasion to wonder whether white supremacists are any more dangerous than regular white people, who tend to enjoy supremacy without believing in it. After staring at ‘‘complacence’’ for quite a long time, I looked it up and discovered that it didn’t mean exactly what I thought it meant. ‘‘A feeling of smug or uncritical satisfaction with oneself or one’s achievements’’ might be an apt description of the dominant white attitude, but that’s more active than what I had in mind. I thought ‘‘complacence’’ meant sitting there in your house, neither smug nor satisfied, just lost in the illusion of ownership. This is an illusion that depends on forgetting the redlining, block busting, racial covenants, contract buying, loan discrimination, housing projects, mass incarceration, predatory lending and deed thefts that have prevented so many black Americans from building wealth the way so many white Americans have, through homeownership. I erased ‘‘complacence’’ and wrote ‘‘complicity.’’ I erased it. ‘‘Debt,’’ I wrote. Then, ‘‘forgotten debt.’’

I read several hundred pages of ‘‘Little House on the Prairie’’ to my 5-year-old son one day when he was home sick from school. Near the end of the book, when the Ingalls family is reckoning with the fact that they built their little house illegally on Indian Territory, and just after an alliance between tribes has been broken by a disagreement over whether or not to attack the settlers, Laura watches the Osage abandoning their annual buffalo hunt and leaving Kansas. Her family will leave, too. At this point, my son asked me to stop reading. ‘‘Is it too sad?’’ I asked. ‘‘No,’’ he said, ‘‘I just don’t need to know any more.’’ After a few moments of silence, he added, ‘‘I wish I was French.’’

The Indians in ‘‘Little House’’ are French-speaking, so I understood that my son was saying he wanted to be an Indian. ‘‘I wish all that didn’t happen,’’ he said. And then: ‘‘But I want to stay here, I love this place. I don’t want to leave.’’ He began to cry, and I realized that when I told him ‘‘Little House’’ was about the place where we live, meaning the Midwest, he thought I meant it was about the town where we live and the house we had just bought. Our house is not that little house, but we do live on the wrong side of what used to be an Indian boundary negotiated by a treaty that was undone after the 1830 Indian Removal Act. We live in Evanston, Ill., named after John Evans, who founded the university where I teach and defended the Sand Creek massacre as necessary to the settling of the West. What my son was expressing — that he wants the comfort of what he has but that he is uncomfortable with how he came to have it — is one conundrum of whiteness.

‘‘Tell me again about the liar who lied about a lie,’’ my son said recently. It took me a moment to register that he meant Rachel Dolezal. He had heard me talking about her with Noel Ignatiev, author of ‘‘How the Irish Became White.’’ I had said: ‘‘She might be a liar, but she’s a liar who lied about a lie. The original fraud was not hers.’’ Because I was talking to Noel, who sent me to James Baldwin’s essay ‘‘On Being White ... and Other Lies’’ when I was in college, I didn’t have to clarify that the lie I was referring to was the idea that there is any such thing as a Caucasian race. Dolezal’s parents had insisted to reporters that she was ‘‘Caucasian’’ by birth, though she is not from the Caucasus region, which includes contemporary Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Outside that context, the word ‘‘Caucasian’’ is a flimsy and fairly meaningless product of the 18th-century pseudoscience that helped invent a white race.

Whiteness is not a kinship or a culture. White people are no more closely related to one another, genetically, than we are to black people. American definitions of race allow for a white woman to give birth to black children, which should serve as a reminder that white people are not a family. What binds us is that we share a system of social advantages that can be traced back to the advent of slavery in the colonies that became the United States. ‘‘There is, in fact, no white community,’’ as Baldwin writes. Whiteness is not who you are. Which is why it is entirely possible to despise whiteness without disliking yourself.

When he was 4, my son brought home a library book about the slaves who built the White House. I didn’t tell him that slaves once accounted for more wealth than all the industry in this country combined, or that slaves were, as Ta-Nehisi Coates writes, ‘‘the down payment’’ on this country’s independence, or that freed slaves became, after the Civil War, ‘‘this country’s second mortgage.’’ Nonetheless, my overview of slavery and Jim Crow left my son worried about what it meant to be white, what legacy he had inherited. ‘‘I don’t want to be on this team,’’ he said, with his head in his hands. ‘‘You might be stuck on this team,’’ I told him, ‘‘but you don’t have to play by its rules.’’

Even as I said this, I knew that he would be encouraged, at every juncture in his life, to believe wholeheartedly in the power of his own hard work and deservedness, to ignore inequity, to accept that his sense of security mattered more than other people’s freedom and to agree, against all evidence, that a system that afforded him better housing, better education, better work and better pay than other people was inherently fair.

My son’s first week in kindergarten was devoted entirely to learning rules. At his school, obedience is rewarded with fake money that can be used, at the end of the week, to buy worthless toys that break immediately. Welcome to capitalism, I thought when I learned of this system, which produced, that week, a yo-yo that remained stuck at the bottom of its string. The principal asked all the parents to submit a signed form acknowledging that they had discussed the Code of Conduct with their children, but I didn’t sign the form. Instead, my son and I discussed the civil rights movement, and I reminded him that not all rules are good rules and that unjust rules must be broken. This was, I now see, a somewhat unhinged response to the first week of kindergarten. I know that schools need rules, and I am a teacher who makes rules, but I still want my son to know the difference between compliance and complicity.

For me, whiteness is not an identity but a moral problem. Becoming black is not the answer to the problem of whiteness, though I sympathize with the impulse, as does Noel. ‘‘Imagine the loneliness of those who, born to a group they regard as unjust and oppressive and not wanting to be part of that group, are left on their own to figure their way out,’’ Noel wrote recently in his own narrative, ‘‘Passing,’’ the story of how he left a lower-middle-class family and a college education to work in factories for the next 23 years.

I met Noel after he left the factories for Harvard, when he was the editor, with John Garvey, of a journal called Race Traitor. In it, I read about groups of volunteers who worked in shifts using video cameras to record police misconduct in their cities. I read about the school-board member who challenged the selection practices that had produced, in a district where only 22 percent of the students were white, a gifted program in which 81 percent of the students were white. Race Traitor articulated for me the possibility that a person who looks white can refuse to act white, meaning refuse to collude with the injustices of the law-enforcement system and the educational system, among other things. This is what Noel called ‘‘new abolitionism.’’ John Brown was his model, and the institution he was intent on abolishing was whiteness.

It was because I read Race Traitor in my 20s that I stopped, in my 30s, when I saw a black man being handcuffed by his car on an empty stretch of road next to a cemetery in Chicago. I was carrying my son, who was 2, on the back of my bicycle. ‘‘What do you want?’’ the police officer yelled at me, already irritated, as soon as I stopped. ‘‘I’m just watching,’’ I said. ‘‘Just being a witness.’’ I didn’t yet own a phone that could record video. He took a few threatening steps toward me, yelling about what I would do differently in his situation if I was so smart. My son was scared and began to cry. The officer kept barking at me. When my son broke into a loud wail, I memorized the number on the back of the police van and left. I now wonder what I thought I was going to do with that number: report the police to the police? By the time I got back to my apartment, my hands were still shaking, I had forgotten the number and I was dismayed with myself.

Refusing to collude in injustice is, I’ve found, easier said than done. Collusion is written onto our way of life, and nearly every interaction among white people is an invitation to collusion. Being white is easy, in that nobody is expected to think about being white, but this is exactly what makes me uneasy about it. Without thinking, I would say that believing I am white doesn’t cost me anything, that it’s pure profit, but I suspect that isn’t true. I suspect whiteness is costing me, as Baldwin would say, my moral life.

And whiteness is costing me my community. It is the wedge driven between me and my neighbors, between me and other mothers, between me and other workers. I know there’s more too. I have written and erased a hundred sentences here, trying and failing to articulate something that I can sense but not yet speak. Like a bad loan, the kind in which the payments increase over time, the price of whiteness remains hidden behind its promises.

‘‘Her choice to give up whiteness was a privilege,’’ Michael Jeffries wrote of Dolezal in The Boston Globe. Noel said to me, ‘‘If giving up whiteness is a privilege, what do you call hanging on to it?’’ As Dolezal surrendered her position in the N.A.A.C.P. and lost her teaching job, I thought of the white police officers who killed unarmed black people and kept their jobs. That the penalty for disowning whiteness appears to be more severe than the penalty for killing a black person says something about what our culture holds dear.

The moral concept of Schuld (‘‘guilt’’), Nietzsche wrote, ‘‘descends from the very material concept of Schulden (‘debts’).’’ Material debt predates moral debt. The point he is making is that guilt has its source not in some innate sense of justice, not in God, but in something as base as commerce. Nietzsche has the kind of disdain for guilt that many people now reserve for ‘‘white guilt’’ in particular. We seem to believe that the crime is not investing in whiteness but feeling badly about it.

Even before I started reading Nietzsche, I had the uncomfortable suspicion that my good life, my house and my garden and the ‘‘good’’ public school my son attends, might not be entirely good. Even as I painted my walls and planted my tomatoes and attended parent-teacher conferences last year, I was pestered by the possibility that all this was built on a bedrock of evil and that evil was running through our groundwater. But I didn’t think in exactly those terms because the word ‘‘evil’’ is not usually part of my vocabulary — I picked it up from Nietzsche.

‘‘Evil’’ is how slaves describe their masters. In Nietzsche’s telling, Roman nobles called their way of life ‘‘good,’’ while their Jewish slaves called the same way of life ‘‘evil.’’ The invention of the concept of evil was, according to Nietzsche, a kind of power grab. It was an attempt by the powerless to undermine the powerful. More power to them, I think. But Nietzsche and I disagree on this, among other things. Like many white people, he regards guilt as a means of manipulation, a killjoy. Those who resent the powerful, he writes, use guilt to undermine their power and rob them of their pleasure in life. And this, I believe, is what makes guilt potentially redemptive.

Guilt is what makes a good life built on evil no longer good. I have a memory of the writer Sherman Alexie cautioning me against this way of thinking. I remember him saying, ‘‘White people do crazy [expletive] when they feel guilty.’’ That I can’t dispute. Guilty white people try to save other people who don’t want or need to be saved, they make grandiose, empty gestures, they sling blame, they police the speech of other white people and they dedicate themselves to the fruitless project of their own exoneration. But I’m not sure any of that is worse than what white people do in denial. Especially when that denial depends on a constant erasure of both the past and the present.

Once you’ve been living in a house for a while, you tend to begin to believe that it’s yours, even though you don’t own it yet. When those of us who are convinced of our own whiteness deny our debt, this may be an inevitable result of having lived for so long in a house bought on credit but never paid off. We ourselves have never owned slaves, we insist, and we never say the n-word. ‘‘It is as though we have run up a credit-card bill,’’ Coates writes of Americans, ‘‘and, having pledged to charge no more, remain befuddled that the balance does not disappear.’’

A guilty white person is usually imagined as someone made impotent by guilt, someone rendered powerless. But why not imagine guilt as a prod, a goad, an impetus to action? Isn’t guilt an essential cog in the machinery of the conscience? When I search back through my correspondence with Sherman Alexie, I find him insisting that we can’t afford to disempower white people because we need them to empower the rest of us. White people, he proposes, have the political power to make change exactly because they are white.

I once feared buying a house because I didn’t want to be owned. I had saved money with no purpose in mind other than the freedom to do whatever I wanted. Now I’m bound to this house, though I’m still free to lose it if I choose. But that isn’t the version of freedom that interests me at the moment. I’m more compelled by a freedom that would allow me to deserve what I have. Call it liberation, maybe. If debt can be repaid incrementally, resulting eventually in ownership, perhaps so can guilt.

What is the condition of white life? We are moral debtors who act as material creditors. Our banks make bad loans. Our police, like Nietzsche’s creditors, act out their power on black bodies. And, as I see in my own language, we confuse whiteness with ownership. For most of us, the police aren’t ‘‘ours’’ any more than the banks are. When we buy into whiteness, we entertain the delusion that we’re business partners with power, not its minions. And we forget our debt to ourselves.",REAL
The Profound Emptiness of ‘Resilience’,"This usage of ‘‘resilience’’ has flared up amid the continuing protests on college campuses. The psychologist Peter Gray used the phrase ‘‘declining student resilience’’ in Psychology Today to describe what he sees as a troubling helplessness among students. At one major university he studied, ‘‘emergency calls to counseling had more than doubled over the past five years,’’ he wrote. ‘‘Students are increasingly seeking help for, and apparently having emotional crises over, problems of everyday life.’’

As the protests against racism at colleges have gathered momentum, from the University of Missouri to Yale, Princeton, Claremont McKenna College, Ithaca College and beyond, they have been cast as just the latest attempt — after trigger warnings and safe spaces — to transform universities into what James Kirchick called in Tablet ‘‘cosseting nurseries.’’ On the left and right, students have attracted intense contempt, been labeled ‘‘crybullies’’ and ‘‘little Robespierres.’’ Charles Murray, the conservative co-­author of ‘‘The Bell Curve,’’ tweeted, ‘‘These kids have no grit & the resilience of champagne flutes.’’ Conor Friedersdorf, writing in The Atlantic, argued that students ‘‘are being robbed of resilience and disempowered by mistaken ideological assumptions.’’

It’s not that circumstances are so insufferable, the logic goes, it’s just that these young people are terribly touchy nowadays. Articles and editorials in The Atlantic, The Wall Street Journal and Tablet have largely minimized the extent and impact of racism on campus and have depicted students as fragile and irrational, looking for administrations to serve in loco parentis. In The Atlantic, Friedersdorf suggested that the protests at Yale stemmed from an ‘‘email that hurt their feelings,’’ referring to a note sent by Erika Christakis, the associate master of Yale’s Silliman College, dismissing a request from the school’s Intercultural Affairs Committee that students show consideration to one another’s cultures when dressing up for Halloween.

Journalists have breathlessly reported on Yale’s luxurious student amenities (‘‘These are young people who live in safe, heated buildings with two Steinway grand pianos, an indoor basketball court’’) or the students’ financial circumstances, assuming that an atmosphere of wealth should inoculate you from experiencing racism.

In 2015, the Department of Education reported 146 cases of racial harassment on campuses, although studies suggest that only 13 percent of racial incidents are reported. By playing down the racism that the students have faced, it’s easier to frame the protests as tantrums, products of brittle spirits, on a continuum with grade grubbing. Somehow, demands for resilience have become a cleverly coded way to shame those speaking out against injustices.

In Tablet, James Kirchick wrote, ‘‘When I hear, in 2015, students complain about feeling ‘marginalized’ at Yale due to their racial, ethnic, religious, sexual or any other identity ... I can’t help but think of James Meredith.’’ In 1962, flanked by federal marshals, Meredith became the first black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi. ‘‘When I see photographs of Meredith and other black students of the civil rights era,’’ Kirchick wrote, ‘‘I don’t see people pleading for dean’s excuses so they can huddle in a ‘safe space’ to recover from ‘traumatic racial events.’ I see unbelievably courageous young men and women.’’

Of course, it’s one thing to look at a photograph of James Meredith and concoct a fantasy of his bravery and resilience — a photograph is silent; it cannot clarify or correct. To listen to James Meredith is a different thing entirely. ‘‘Ole Miss kicked my butt, and they’re still celebrating,’’ he said in an interview with Esquire in 2012. ‘‘Because every black that’s gone there since me has been insulted, humiliated, and they can’t even tell their story. Everybody has to tell James Meredith’s story — which is a lie. The powers that be in Mississippi understand this very clearly.’’ He continued, ‘‘They’re gonna keep on doin’ it because it makes it impossible for the blacks there now to say anything about what’s happened to them.’’

But the students are saying what’s happened to them now, insisting upon it. And in doing so, they are reframing resilience. It’s not just the strength to stay the course but to question it and propose others, not just to survive but to thrive. In the last month, portraits of black faculty members have been defaced at Harvard Law School, and at least four campuses have received death threats against black students. But at Yale, more than 1,000 students gathered in a March of Resilience. They carried signs saying: ‘‘We out here. We’ve been here. We ain’t leaving. We are loved.’’ Why rise from the ashes without asking why you had to burn?",REAL
The Human Flock,"Photo

There are 12 of us by the lake. Some have set out spotting scopes on tripods upon the grass; others carry binoculars. Silently we stand and wait for the Hungarian dusk. The sun slips behind an expanse of steely water, and the air grows colder. Then we hear a faint noise like baying hounds or discordant bugles, at first hardly discernible through the wind rattling the reeds. It grows into an unearthly clamor. ‘‘Here they come!’’ someone whispers. Overhead, a long, wavering chevron of beating wings is inked across the darkening sky. Behind it flows others, and there are others behind them, all passing overhead in ever-increasing waves, filling the air with an astonishing barrage of noise and beauty.

The birds above us are long-necked, graceful Eurasian cranes. Every autumn more than a hundred thousand of them stop off on their southward migration from Russia and Northern Europe to spend a few weeks in the Hortobagy region in northeastern Hungary, feeding on maize left in the fields after the harvest. Every night they fly to roost in huge numbers in the safety of shallow fish-farm lakes, attracting wildlife tourists who come here to witness the spectacle of their evening flights. Similarly impressive congregations can be seen in many other places. In Nebraska, more than half a million sandhill cranes fatten up in cornfields before continuing their spring migration; in Quebec, watchers thrill at blizzards of snow geese blotting out the sky as they rise from the St. François River. In Britain, clouds of wintering starlings flying to their roosts draw crowds of all ages.

Standing so close to such vast masses of birds affects everyone differently: Some people laugh, some cry, others shake their heads or utter profanities. Language fails in the face of immense flocks of beating wings. As I stare up in awe, it strikes me that this is, at heart, a kind of modern secular pilgrimage.

Our brains are built to wrest familiar meaning from the confusions of the world. Watching the cranes at dusk, I see them turn first into strings of musical notation, then mathematical patterns. The snaking lines synchronize so that each bird raises its wings a fraction before the one behind it, each moving flock suddenly resolving itself into a filmstrip showing a single bird stretched through time. It is an astonishing image that makes me blink in surprise. Part of the allure of flocking birds is their ability to provoke optical illusions. I remember my astonishment as a child watching thousands of shorebirds flying against a gray sky vanish and reappear in an instant as the birds turned their countershaded bodies in the air. Perhaps the best-known example is the hosts of European starlings that assemble in the sky before they roost. We call them murmurations, but the Danish term, sort sol, is better: black sun. It captures their almost celestial strangeness. Standing on the Suffolk coast a few years ago, I saw a far-flung mist of starlings turn in a split second into an ominous sphere like a dark planet hanging over the marshes. Everyone around me gasped audibly before it exploded in a maelstrom of wings.

Though the rapid dynamism of flocking birds is a large part of their beauty, newspapers and news sites often carry still photographs of murmurations that look like other things: sharks, mushrooms, dinosaurs. Earlier this year, an image of one flock over New York City shifting into the shape of Vladimir Putin’s face went viral, though it may have been fake. It’s not difficult, when presented with such a strange phenomenon, to believe in signs and wonders.",REAL
Steve Carell Does Not Mock the Undeserving,"“The Big Short” seems to be the first movie in which that conceit is true but not played for comedy. Your character’s deeply held, boneheaded conviction — that the housing market is an unsustainable bubble — turns out to be entirely correct. I try not to play characters that ever have any self-awareness that their conviction is boneheaded. And I think that can either be funny or dramatic. After all, a character doesn’t know whether they’re in a comedy or a drama.

Your character acts as the moral center of the movie. At one point, he says that it won’t be the big banks that pay the price for the mortgage collapse, but rather “immigrants and poor people.” Do you think that’s what happened? I tend to defer to people like Michael Lewis when it comes to things like that.

Earlier in your career, you were part of the team that shifted “The Daily Show” from mocking stupid news items to mocking the news media itself for being kind of stupid. Yeah, it became less snarky. Early on it was shooting fish in a barrel. Jon wanted to raise the bar — if we had an ax to grind, it should be with people who deserved it.

One turning point was when you interviewed John McCain in 2000. After a bunch of softball questions, you asked him about an apparent contradiction in his appropriations record. It might have been the first time a “Daily Show” interview was tougher than a traditional news outlet. But of course I immediately backed off it. I didn’t go for the jugular. Once he blanched, I let him off the hook.

You’ve characterized the show’s shift away from field stories about wackos as a moral decision. It was. When I first came on the show, I had to quickly figure out how I was going to make it work for me, morally. I don’t think I would have been able to live with myself had I just gone out and mocked people who didn’t deserve it. So I turned it around on myself: I became the idiot reporter, and the brunt of the joke.

Should I Marry the Son of a Crook?,"It’s possible that none of these considerations speak to you. Then maybe you really should call it quits with your boyfriend. Not for your sake, but for his.

About seven years ago I began taking yoga lessons with an influential yoga instructor. The instructor insists that everyone take private lessons with him, in addition to group classes. Anyone can enroll in his classes, but his goal is to teach yoga to those with addiction and mental-health issues. During a few private lessons, he made several unwanted passes at me. I quit the private lessons and left the studio for several months because I felt uncomfortable. I resolved to return to the studio but promised myself not to be alone in the room with the instructor. I didn’t tell anyone about what happened. Now, several years later, I’ve found out that my yoga instructor sexually assaulted a close friend during her private lesson (she does not plan to report the incident to the police). I plan to leave the studio indefinitely. However, several friends at the yoga studio have asked why I am leaving. Should I tell them what I know? Can I do anything to help protect others?

Yes. Your friend is entitled not to pursue the matter with the authorities, but this yoga instructor’s conduct with you was wrong, and his conduct with your friend was criminal. Silence will enable this abuse to continue. I’ve heard nothing that would prevent you from warning others — in ways that protect your friend’s privacy. Indeed, given that he works with people who are especially vulnerable, I’d be inclined to say that you ought to let as many people know as you can.

I have two friends — one leans somewhat right in his political views (Friend No. 1), and the other leans fairly far left (Friend No. 2). I stand somewhere in the middle. A few months ago, Friend No. 1 bought a new camera in a store but had the store record it as an online purchase and send it to his home to avoid the sales tax. Just recently, Friend No. 2 was explaining to me why he and his wife live half the year out of state and half the year in our high-tax state. If they maintain their residency outside our state (in a state with no income taxes), they can avoid paying the income tax for our state. After hearing each of these stories, my stomach turned. I pay taxes. I get benefits — roads, fire, police, education and so on. My friends get these benefits, too, but somehow they don’t seem to connect the dots between paying and receiving services. Is there anything I can say to my right-leaning friend to remind him of the services our taxes provide and to my left-leaning friend to inquire why he would vote for a party that believes in taxes while he himself avoids paying them?

Tax evasion and tax avoidance are two different creatures. Only one has fangs. Your right-wing friend engaged in tax evasion. He and the camera dealer agreed to report their transaction, which occurred in a way that incurred sales tax, as if it had been a transaction that didn’t. That’s wrong (and illegal too). Your left-wing friend, on the other hand, is engaging in tax avoidance. He and his wife are willing to spend enough days out of a state to escape its income tax — although they are probably contributing, either directly as owners or indirectly as renters, to property taxes in both states. They’re also paying federal taxes, of course, which you can’t escape by carefully timed movements across state lines. And they’re benefiting the low-tax state through their consumption.

Tax laws are complicated, and many of them are actually meant to shape our behavior. Friend No. 2 is playing by the rules. I don’t think this sort of tax avoidance is wrong. If your friend does, however, he’s certainly acting against his own principles. But if the problem is just that you think he’s taxed less than he ought to be, fault the rules, not your friend.

If you and Friend No. 2 think he oughtn’t be able to avoid taxes in this way, you could always invite him to join you in a campaign for tax reform. But revolution, not reform, would be needed to prevent states from setting their own tax rates!",REAL
The One-Bowl Wonder,"Photo

If you’ve ever served individual cocktails, made to order, to each of your party guests — the one who wants a gimlet, the one who wants a martini on the rocks with three olives, please — you know that that way lies madness. There’s really only one way to serve a large group sanely: Punch is the party host’s liquid liberator. It is inherently festive and categorically communal. It must be prepared in advance, in the rela­tive quietude that exists in the kitchen a few hours before the meal begins. Then, when the party’s on and the joint is jumping, all you have to do is occasionally replenish the punch bowl.

To start, consider the food you’re serving at the party. Here, I was inspired by the Texan feast in this issue, and sought out a Southwestern-accented punch devised by Alba Huerta, owner and bartender at Julep, a Houston cocktail bar. I was after something not too sweet but still celebratory, earthy but sophisticated, and Huerta’s West Cave Cellar Punch is just right.

It’s not a punch you can just whip up with whatever’s lurking in your liquor cabinet and pantry, but the holidays merit a bit of a fuss — and a bit of a splurge. A few ingredients may be unfamiliar. First, it requires the making of oleo-saccharum. The word may sound like an ancient Roman curse — go ahead, shout Oleo-saccharum! at your adversaries and give them a good start — but it’s what David Wondrich, in his book ‘‘Punch: The Delights (and Dangers) of the Flowing Bowl,’’ describes as ‘‘dog Latin for ‘oil-sugar.’ ’’ Oleo-saccharum isn’t difficult to prepare, but you’ll need to factor an extra hour into your prep time. Combining citrus peel with sugar to extract as much of the peel’s fragrant oils as possible provides an exceptionally flavorful foundation for punch that many consider essential. Oleo-saccharum most often calls for lemon peels and white sugar; here, Huerta uses instead two deeper, darker sugars — palm sugar and panela, unrefined cane sugar — and the peels of grapefruit and its comely and commodious cousin, the pomelo.

Sotol is made from desert spoon, a dreamily named plant that grows in northern Mexico and parts of the Southwestern United States. It is distilled in a process similar to mezcal, but it’s generally lower in alcohol than its cousin, and mellower. The pomelo juice (be warned: It takes effort to extract) ‘‘accentuates the earthiness of the sotol,’’ Huerta says, and ‘‘the sugars offer a hint of butterscotch and caramel flavors that bring out the vanillin quality of the spirit.’’ Palo cortado — a rare, complex sherry — contributes some depth and nuttiness. Tequila fortifies it, harmoniously. Mandarin orange liqueur amplifies the citrus of the pomelo and grapefruit. And sparkling wine gives it the buoyancy and bubbles to remind us that punch wants us to have a good time — and that nothing’s more important than that at a holiday celebration.

Letter of Recommendation: Falling,"Photo

For my 41st birthday, an especially sadistic buddy gave me a video of me falling off my skateboard nearly 160 times. It’s a humbling 8 minutes 43 seconds, made all the more cutting by the soundtrack: Nine Inch Nails playing ‘‘Something I Can Never Have’’ and ‘‘Hurt.’’ The video charts my four-year quest to land something called a 360 varial, in which you launch above the lip of a ramp, spin the board a full rotation, catch it with your lead hand and pull it back under you before re-entry.

For every fall in the video, there were hundreds he didn’t include; still hundreds more weren’t filmed at all. So it goes. Skateboarders spend their lives working to reconcile balance and gravity, struggling to negotiate a truce that will last through each trick. But balance is kind of a fickle and cowardly twerp, gravity a burly disciplinarian.

I’ve skateboarded for 30 years, and one of the best-kept secrets about the sport is that most falls don’t hurt. Learning to skate is, in fact, tantamount to learning to fall. I tend to run or roll or slide out of falls without trouble. There are exceptions, sure, and skateboarders are so familiar with the act that they’ve developed a crude taxonomy; there are ‘‘scorpion falls,’’ belly flops so violent that your back arches and your toes nearly tap your scalp; ‘‘Wilsons,’’ in which the board shoots forward and you loop backward like a cartoon character slipping on a banana; and ‘‘credit cards,’’ which find the tip of your board securely slotted where the sun doesn’t shine.

Many falls do hurt, of course. I’ve broken bones and knocked my pelvis out of alignment and blacked out from hitting my head at the bottom of a drained pool. I have a red wishbone-shaped scar on my shin that would probably be less promi­nent if I’d gotten stitches — there was enough blood to soak a favorite pair of socks — and I recently bashed my thumb so completely that, for a while, my phone couldn’t recognize my fingerprint. Usually, though, I just collect my board and try that trick again. Then again and again.

Consequential Falls in History 1589: According to legend, Galileo Galilei dropped cannonballs of varying weights off the Leaning Tower of Pisa. 1618: The Defenestration of Prague sparked the Thirty Years’ War. Circa 1666: A falling apple hit Isaac Newton on the head. 2012: Felix Baumgartner fell from a height of more than 24 miles, becoming the first person to break the sound barrier using only gravity.

My most punishing falls happen precisely when I’m trying not to fall. The issue isn’t that excessive caution is dangerous on a skateboard. It’s that timidity is almost as dangerous as recklessness. My wishbone scar is a result of botching a trick I’ve had in the bag for two decades; today, I consider it a reminder that falls lurk around every corner. I learned to accept this long ago, but for plenty of wholly natural and evolutionarily essential reasons, my body is powerfully — vehemently, obstinately, physiologically — opposed to what I repeatedly force it to do. The trick, as it were, is to reach a détente with falling: to accept its inevitability while refusing to see it as a setback.

In the video, I flail and curse and throw my board; I try one ramp after another, getting older with each fall. My favorite is one in which I manage to get the board back under my feet, but a minor (read: heartbreaking) miscalculation in weight placement metastasizes into a full-on Wilson as I return to the ramp. After tumbling to a stop, I briefly curl into a version of child’s pose. Some falls are exhilarating — you’re shot through with the heady adrenaline of averted disaster; others are inspiring — the board flips in an unexpected direction and spawns an idea for another trick; still other falls are plain demoralizing — so physically or emotionally jarring that you have to confront the likelihood of never getting so close again. The child’s-pose fall was of that kind.",REAL
‘Snowflakes’,"Yesterday they were denticulate as dandelion greens, they locked together in spokes and fell so weightlessly I thought of best friends holding hands. And then of mating hawks that soar into the air to link their claws and somersault down, separating just before they touch the ground. Sometimes the snowflakes glitter, it’s more like tinkling than snow, it never strikes, and I want to be struck, that is I want to know what to do. I begin enthusiastically, I go in a hurry, I fall pell-mell down a hill, like a ball of yarn’s unraveling trajectory — down and away but also surprising ricochets that only after seem foretold. Yesterday I took a walk because I wanted to be struck, and what happened was an accident: a downy clump floated precisely in my eye. The lashes clutched it close, melting it against the eye’s hot surface. And like the woman talking to herself in an empty church eventually realizes she is praying, I walked home with eyes that melted snow.",REAL
Familiar Ground,"Like many people in the area, she and my brother-in-law, Valerio, grow mainly olive trees. He has something called a frantoio, which is where you press olives to make olive oil. It’s a huge, high-tech building that you can drive lorries in and out of. When I arrived, I was shocked to see that it was full of aloe-vera plants, thousands of them.

There were stacks and stacks of them everywhere, all different sizes, just jumbled together, one on top of the other. It took my son and me a day just to group the plants according to size. I dreaded the next day, when we would go to plant them.

We got up at 5:30 in the morning, had breakfast and loaded up our tools, and then all of us — me, my son and several family members, including siblings, a niece and two nephews — set out for the fields.

There were people already at work that morning. It gets too hot later in the day, so you have to do what you can before noon. The cicadas were humming, and we could feel the sirocco wind blowing in from the Sahara, bringing all its oppressive heat and humidity with it.

When we got to the fields, they looked parched and dry, almost like a desert, and my son gave me a look. But local people know that the land is actually very benevolent. You can pluck persimmons from the trees at the right time of year and collect almonds from the ground. You can wear a T-shirt in winter, and you can also grow things that don’t grow in many other parts of Europe.

We started planting. And fairly soon it was as if we were kids back on the farm again. Normally, there would be arguments, disagreements and complications, but in this situation, with a large job to do and a limited time in which to do it, we reverted to this traditional family organism.

We all fit together, and even Sean, who is so into his music and his videos and about to go off to study film, was pitching in as if he’d been brought up to it, wheeling barrows full of aloe vera around to the places where family members worked. When it comes to technology, Sean often makes fun of me, but here he was suddenly deferring to me.

People hardly spoke as they sweated, dug and planted, but at one point Valerio stopped what he was doing to turn to me.

‘‘You see that field over there?’’ he said.

I squinted to where he was pointing. It was a field not far from ours, glittering in the hot summer sun.

‘‘That’s the field your grandfather used to work.’’

I stared at the field. ‘‘And my father used to work it with him,’’ I said.

Valerio nodded and carried on digging. I went back to it, too, but of course I couldn’t help thinking about my recently departed father. I had heard stories of him as a wild young man, but he worked hard in the fields with his family, just like this. I am the eldest son of an eldest son of an eldest son, all of us sons of the soil, and in that morning I really felt it.

Later on, I pointed out my grandfather’s field to Sean. He grunted. He was very tired, being so unused to physical labor. I’m not sure what he thought. But to me, it felt like a good day. A great day, in fact. A day that eventually will be forgotten but that will repeat itself with every generation.",REAL

How to Skin a Cat,"Photo

‘‘Go with the grain of the hair,’’ says Anthony Eddy, a taxidermist who has worked on house cats, bobcats and mountain lions. The cleanest of the many ways to skin a cat begins with a so-called dorsal cut. Start at the bottom of the skull, and cut a straight line to the base of the tail along the spine. ‘‘Always use a sharp blade,’’ says Eddy, who prefers a carbon steel scalpel. Peel the skin back as you would an orange. Trim carefully around the paws, mouth, nose and eyes. This is obviously not work for the squeamish, but to make a lifelike remembrance of an animal means doing things that make its death inescapable.

For larger specimens, Eddy opts for traditional taxidermy, pulling the tanned skin over a polyurethane manikin. For house cats, he prefers freeze-drying, which retains the unique characteristics of a pet’s face and involves replacing the internal organs and fat with silicone, then drying the posed body in a machine for up to seven months. ‘‘When a hunter brings in a deer, they just want it to look like a deer,’’ Eddy says. ‘‘Cat owners don’t want a generic cat — they want Fluffy.’’

Put any creature you want preserved in the freezer within two hours of its death; rigor mortis sets in as soon as the body cools. ‘‘Bacteria is your enemy,’’ Eddy says. Thawed animals become particularly pliable and easy to skin. If you hope to make a rug or want to freeze-dry, begin with a ventral incision along the underside.

Last year, about 40 years after he opened his shop in Slater, Mo., Eddy sold the pet-preservation part of his business to his nephew. He no longer wants to answer to emotionally fraught pet owners who demand the transformation of often scrawny, graying cadavers into sleeker, younger ones. He still works on deer heads and wildlife to which people have no particular nostalgic attachments. But, Eddy says, ‘‘when someone asks for a smiling cat, what does that even mean?’’",REAL

WOMEN IN HOLLWOOD

Maureen Dowd wrote about the dearth of women in Hollywood, which remains mired in pervasive sexism that keeps women from running studios and directing blockbuster pictures.

Thanks for the brilliant article by Maureen Dowd, who succinctly illuminated the equal talent and ambition of women, as compared to men, in the movie-­industry arts. The uneven statistics representing female numbers prompted a visceral response — one sadly too familiar in a century that, by now, should be celebrating those female talents 50 percent of the time. Eileen Cohen, Milford, Conn.

I read the article and looked at the 63 photos of the women featured on the cover. All but a tiny handful of cinematographers pictured there are above-the-line people — executives, writers, producers, directors. Where are the filmmakers? The ones who work 14 to 18 hours a day on a picture or a TV show? The makeup artists? The electricians? The script supervisors? The grips? The costume designers and their crews? The prop makers, the prop supervisors, the lead people? The set dressers? The hairdressers? The camera operators, focus-­pullers, assistants? The special-­effects technicians? The editors and their crews? The assistant directors? They can make these films on their own, without the pencil-­pushers at the top. Your article paints another skewed picture of this industry. J.S. Blum, Neskowin, Ore.

Everything that is described in Maureen Dowd’s article about sexism regarding female directors applies to female photographers. By hiring a man for your shoot, the message you sent to female photographers and students was that a woman’s perspective was not important. The opportunity for a female photographer to meet and photograph these 63 powerful women would have been a life changer. That’s why, to me, it’s 63 missed opportunities. And that hurts.

A Dream of Secular Utopia in ISIS’ Backyard,"‘‘Why would I be afraid?’’ I said.

‘‘In a world where there’s no God,’’ he said, ‘‘how do you deal with the constant fear of dying?’’

The next morning, I met with a student named Sami Saeed Mirza. I had barely slept, kept up by the intermittent swoosh of fighter jets and a series of loud thuds, whether distant bombs or the innocuous din of street life, I couldn’t tell. At one point, I went onto the rooftop and looked out at the horizon, a squiggly line of undulating sand spotted with a few stone huts. It was beautiful, in its way, a whole world painted with a single brush stroke of brown. Somewhere out there was the front line.

Mirza, 29, had sad, drowsy eyes and wore thick spectacles perched low on his nose. He hadn’t noticed the commotion. ‘‘I’m used to the sound,’’ he said. Unlike other students at the academy, Mirza grew up outside Syria in a small village in western Iraq. He is not a Muslim or an atheist but a Yazidi, part of an ethnic and religious minority that practices a modern form of Zoroastrianism. He hadn’t heard of Abdullah Ocalan until recently. In August 2014, ISIS extremists attacked his village, near the city of Sinjar, and butchered as many as 5,000 of his neighbors. While Mirza and his family were trapped on a mountain for four days, waiting to die, a battalion of women — Y.P.J. soldiers — fought through the ISIS lines and created a path for them to escape. Mirza, severely dehydrated and on the verge of collapse, fled.

‘‘The battle made me think of women differently,’’ he told me. ‘‘Women fighters — they saved us. My society, Yazidi society, is more, let’s say, traditional. I’d never thought of women as leaders, as heroes, before.’’

Mirza heard about the academy at a refugee camp, and here his education in feminism had continued. He and his fellow students studied a text that Ocalan wrote on gender equality called ‘‘Liberating Life.’’ In it, Ocalan argues that problems of bad governance, corruption and weak democratic institutions in Middle Eastern societies can’t be solved without achieving full equality for women. He once told P.K.K. militants in Turkey, ‘‘You don’t need to be [men] now. You need to think like a woman, for men only fight for power. But women love nature, trees, the mountains. … That is how you can become a true patriot.’’

‘‘I’ve learned the truth,’’ Mirza said. ‘‘The leader has shown us the correct interpretation of society.’’ Rojava’s Constitution — its ‘‘social contract’’ — was ratified on Jan. 9, 2014, and it enshrines gender equality and freedom of religion as inviolable rights for all residents. The Sinjar massacre gave Rojavan authorities an opportunity to show that they were deadly serious about protecting these rights. Still, I wondered if the rescue of Yazidis like Mirza wasn’t also strategic, a way to enlist the minority group in the defense of Rojava.

‘‘Why do you think the Y.P.G. and Y.P.J. saved you?’’ I asked.

‘‘Maybe I know, maybe I don’t,’’ he said. ‘‘But they are the only ones who came to help us. America didn’t come. The pesh merga’’ — Iraqi Kurdistan’s military — ‘‘didn’t come.’’ Now he wanted to devote his life to the teachings of Ocalan. ‘‘I was nothing before coming to the academy,’’ he said.

Despite his imprisonment nearly a thousand miles away, Abdullah Ocalan, who is now 66 or 67 (he has no birth certificate), looms as a Wizard-of-Oz-like presence in Rojava. His avuncular visage — broad, bushy eyebrows; a gregarious, toothy grin obscured by a cartoonishly lush mustache — appears everywhere: in the halls and classrooms of the academy, in government buildings, in community centers, in police stations and on pins and patches on the chests of soldiers. This strange founding-fatherhood is the culmination of an unlikely political career that began in November 1978, when Ocalan first gathered two dozen Kurdish revolutionaries in the town of Fis, in southeastern Turkey. His co-conspirators called him Uncle, or Apo in Kurdish, and called themselves the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K.

Ocalan’s initial impulse wasn’t to fashion himself as a philosopher-politician. The P.K.K. members were unabashed Maoists, who used spectacular acts of violence against rival organizations and government soldiers to destabilize and delegitimize Turkey’s authority in the predominantly Kurdish southeast. In 1980, Ocalan fled to Syria, where he was offered shelter by the regime of Hafez al-Assad. For the next 20 years, he led the struggle remotely — from a villa from which he issued orders to his commanders via messenger, letter and telephone. But in 1998, under pressure from Turkey, Assad kicked Ocalan out of the country. He escaped through Europe before he was captured in Kenya with the help of the C.I.A., which by then considered the P.K.K. a terrorist organization. Ocalan’s lawyers claimed that he was drugged and tortured by Turkish security forces while in custody. He was then paraded in front of TV cameras looking frail and confused, like a grandpa who had just woken from a nap, and he did the unthinkable: He renounced the P.K.K.’s effort to create an independent Kurdish homeland.

Ocalan was remanded to Imrali prison, on an island off the coast of Istanbul. This is when his conversion began — what one academic would describe as a transition from ‘‘Stalinist caterpillar to libertarian butterfly.’’ He was the island’s only prisoner, surrounded by 1,000 soldiers there to ensure he could not escape before his execution (a death sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment). The government allowed him to meet with his lawyers to communicate to his followers the details of a cease-fire. He was also permitted books, finding inspiration in Western texts like Michel Foucault’s ‘‘Society Must Be Defended’’ and Benedict Anderson’s ‘‘Imagined Communities.’’ Soon, one of his supporters gave Ocalan his first book by an obscure Vermont-based philosopher named Murray Bookchin. After Ocalan read it, he requested everything Bookchin had ever written. Oliver Kontny, a translator and P.K.K. sympathizer who was working for Ocalan’s lawyers at the time, told me that Ocalan let ‘‘all of us know that he was working on a paradigm change based on what he learned from Bookchin.’’

Bookchin, a mustachioed octogenarian who lived in Burlington, Vt., and typically wore suspenders and pocket protectors, had no idea Ocalan was reading his work — in fact, he thought hardly anyone was. Born in 1921 in the Bronx, Bookchin joined the Communist Party’s Young Pioneers organization at age 9. But by the 1950s, he had sworn off Marxism-Leninism and pioneered a radical ideology he called ‘‘social ecology,’’ which argued that all environmental problems stemmed from social issues like racism, sexism and inequality. While Bookchin enjoyed some notoriety in the 1960s and ’70s (the academic Russell Jacoby once compared his influence on the American left with Noam Chomsky’s), by the 1990s Bookchin was little known in America, save by a faction of prominent environmentalists who ostracized him for his attacks on those he deemed not revolutionary enough. Gary Snyder, the Pulitzer-winning poet, said that Bookchin ‘‘wrote like a Stalinist thug,’’ and the writer Edward Abbey called him a ‘‘fat old lady.’’ An entire volume was published to denounce his work (‘‘Beyond Bookchin’’), and others lambasted him as a hypocrite because of, among other things, his love of Twinkies and Dunkin’ Donuts.

By the time Ocalan was discovering Bookchin’s writing, Bookchin was depressed and spent his days in a wheelchair, according to his partner and assistant Janet Biehl’s recently published biography, ‘‘Ecology or Catastrophe.’’ ‘‘I feel very much like a stranger in a strange world,’’ Biehl recounts Bookchin telling her one night. A society without a vibrant revolutionary leftist movement, he said, ‘‘is not a world in which I … want to live.’’

In solitary confinement, Ocalan studied Bookchin’s magnum opus, ‘‘The Ecology of Freedom,’’ at once a sweeping account of world history and a reimagining of Marx’s ‘‘Das Kapital.’’ In it, Bookchin argues that hierarchical relationships, not capitalism, are our original sin. Humankind’s destruction of the natural world, he argues, is a product of our domination of other people, and only by doing away with all hierarchies — man over woman, old over young, white over black, rich over poor — can we solve the global ecological crisis.

In another work, ‘‘Urbanization Without Cities,’’ Bookchin proposed an alternative to the modern nation-state that he called ‘‘libertarian municipalism.’’ Bookchin believed that the lesson of both Marxist and liberal governments was that the state was an inevitably corrupting influence and antithetical to human freedom. Bookchin favored what he called the ‘‘Hellenic model’’ of democracy, the type of direct, face-to-face government once practiced in ancient Greece. He argued that only by recovering this system could humanity address injustice, and only in this way could radical movements avoid reproducing the same inequalities they had initially set out to defeat.

It was, needless to say, pretty dreamy stuff. But Ocalan saw in it a path toward a new type of revolution. Bookchin’s proposal for achieving independence through ‘‘municipal assemblies’’ suggested to Ocalan a way of finally achieving the elusive Kurdish dream. Maybe the P.K.K. didn’t have to take state power. Maybe it could obtain Kurdish rights by creating its own separate communities inside existing countries, resorting to violence only if attacked. Maybe all along, Ocalan had been mistaken to think that liberation could be achieved by creating a Kurdish-run nation-state, Marxist or otherwise.

Enthralled and seeking guidance, Ocalan had his lawyers send an email to Bookchin. Biehl was sitting at their computer one morning in April 2004, spring snow still covering the streets of Burlington outside, when it popped up in Bookchin’s inbox. Bookchin was lying nearby on a day bed, unable to sit up because of his joint pain. He and Biehl had watched Ocalan’s arrest on television, but Bookchin dismissed him as ‘‘just another third-world Leninist.’’ Now, as Biehl read the email aloud, Bookchin discovered that Ocalan considered himself Bookchin’s ‘‘student,’’ and ‘‘had acquired a good understanding of his work, and was eager to make the ideas applicable to Middle Eastern societies.’’

A few weeks later, Bookchin replied, expressing reluctance to engage in a dialogue. ‘‘You should know that I am quite an elderly man … who is virtually incapable of walking because of osteoarthritis and heart problems,’’ Bookchin wrote. ‘‘Much remains to be explored, which my health and age prohibit me from doing. If you care to write to me further, I ask you to please be patient with an old radical.’’

In March 2005, Ocalan issued the ‘‘Declaration of Democratic Confederalism in Kurdistan.’’ By then, Bookchin had cut off communication. (‘‘Bookchin was heartbroken,’’ Biehl told me. ‘‘He was devastated that the revolution had never happened, and he didn’t trust anybody.’’) The manifesto called on all P.K.K. supporters to implement a version of Bookchin’s ideas; Ocalan urged all guerrilla fighters to read ‘‘The Ecology of Freedom.’’ He instructed his followers to stop attacking the government and instead create municipal assemblies, which he called ‘‘democracy without the state.’’ These assemblies would form a grand confederation that would extend across all Kurdish regions of Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran and would be united by a common set of values based on defending the environment; respecting religious, political and cultural pluralism; and self-defense. He insisted that women be made equal leaders at all levels of society. ‘‘The worldview for which I stand,’’ Ocalan told his lawyers privately, ‘‘is very close to that of Bookchin.’’

When news spread throughout the P.K.K. of Ocalan’s conversion, some were naturally hesitant to abandon the old model of Marxist-Leninist terrorism. ‘‘Who cares about some marginal anarchist with 50 followers?’’ one P.K.K. commander supposedly complained. But in the end, they followed orders. The female leadership, in particular, embraced the new ideology. The P.K.K. set about forming clandestine assemblies immediately in Syria, Iraq and Turkey, waiting for the opportunity to expand. Bookchin ‘‘was the greatest social scientist of the 20th century,’’ according to a P.K.K. tribute sent to Biehl after Bookchin’s death in July 2006. ‘‘Bookchin has not died. … We undertake to make [him] live in our struggle.’’

If a version of Bookchin’s dream is taking root now, it’s in a context he never imagined. ‘‘Rojava is something beyond the nation-state,’’ said Hediye Yusuf, co-president of Jazeera canton, the local municipality of which Qamishli is part. ‘‘It’s a place where all people, all minorities and all genders are equally represented.’’

I met with Yusuf at her office in Rmeilan, at the former headquarters of the state-owned Syrian Petroleum Company, where she and her fellow politicians do business behind rows of blast walls and barricades. Yusuf, a solemn woman who spent much of her 20s imprisoned by the Assad regime, sat at her desk and explained the policy of ‘‘co-governance.’’ Every position at every level of government in Rojava, she said, includes a female equivalent of equal authority. Just as Yusuf was co-governor of Jazeera, Salih Muslim, the chairman of the P.Y.D., had a female counterpart, a woman named Asya Abdullah.

Yusuf shared power with an Arab tribal leader named Sheikh Humeydi Daham al-Hadi. At the start of the civil war, Hadi, who controls a fighting force of 3,000 soldiers, was allied with Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria. Since joining the P.Y.D.’s coalition government, he has embraced Ocalan’s ideology, and his soldiers have been incorporated into the Y.P.G. ‘‘Hadi is certainly not a feminist,’’ Yusuf said, ‘‘but he supports us because we offer a new, functional society that respects everyone, unlike Assad, unlike ISIS, unlike Erdogan.’’ My interpreter spoke briefly on the phone with Hadi, but we were told it wasn’t safe to visit him. He joked about his new codependent relationship with an interviewer in 2014. ‘‘I didn’t ask to share power with a woman,’’ he said, seated alongside Yusuf. ‘‘They made me do it.’’",REAL
The Serial Swatter,"Janet spent a lot of time on a website called Twitch. It can be hard to explain Twitch to nongamers. The site is a lot of different things — a fast-­growing online community, an interactive TV universe, a Wild West of frenzied entrepreneurialism — but at its core, it’s a place where people watch other people play video games. If you don’t understand why anyone would want to do that, you’re not alone, but there are tens of millions of young people who would rather spend two hours on Twitch than endure two minutes of an N.F.L. game or ‘‘The Big Bang Theory.’’ Only four years old, Twitch already has 100 million viewers who consume 20 billion minutes of gaming every month. According to one 2014 study, Twitch is the fourth-­most-­visited site on the Internet during peak traffic periods, after Netflix, Google and Apple and above Facebook and Amazon. (Amazon bought Twitch in 2014 for about $1 billion, all of it cash.) And there is money in it for the gamers themselves, called ‘‘streamers’’: Fans can subscribe to channels for extra access, or they can send donations of any amount. Streamers with modest followings can make respectable incomes — hundreds or thousands of dollars a month — and the very top streamers are getting rich.

A friend told Janet about Twitch in 2013, and she decided to try. ‘‘It’s addicting,’’ she says. ‘‘I love it.’’ She could play games she liked with friends and build a following. Once she got up to 10,000 followers or so, she could pay for books for college, and food, and candles — she had an obsession at one point with candles. She loved the way Twitch enlarged her world. ‘‘I love the community,’’ she says. ‘‘You get to hear about them and their life. And you get to share things with them and share funny moments with them. And they become a part of your life, too. It’s like every day you get on stream, and the same people are there — it’s just nice to see them. It’s like, Hey, what have you done since you were gone?’’

There have always been jerks on the Internet who say rude things to women, and Twitch was hardly free of this — female streamers can usually tune it out with help from their moderators. But when Obnoxious started targeting women, around August 2013, it was clear that he was something different, more frightening. It began with a persistent glitch that drove many streamers offline for hours at a time. They would be streaming some game — say, League of Legends, the most popular PC game, a sprawling battle world with about 30 million daily players — and their Internet connection would slow to a crawl. The cause didn’t become clear until the women received private Twitch messages from Obnoxious, saying he was responsible: I’m DDoSing you right now. ‘‘DDoS’’ stands for ‘‘distributed denial of service,’’ a type of attack that is difficult to defend against and straightforward to execute. It requires only a moderate level of technical ability and the I.P. address — the unique network identity — of the target. And there are websites called ‘‘Skype resolvers’’ on which anyone can type in a Skype user name and find its I.P. address. Once the I.P. address is known, the attacker swamps it with traffic, and the connection goes down.

The women targeted by these attacks were mostly like Janet, college students in their late teens and early 20s. The attacks were eating into their viewer bases, costing them money. If you want it to stop, Obnoxious typed, add me on Skype, and we can talk about it. When the women did as they were asked, they realized that they were dealing with a teenager — a strange, depressive 16-year-old. He told part of his story to one streamer. Growing up in Canada somewhere, his father had abused him and beat him. When he turned 18, he said, he was going to kill himself. The streamer felt sorry for him and urged him not to go through with it. Another streamer took notes on his likes and dislikes. ‘‘Plays Runescape,’’ she wrote. ‘‘Periodically watches cartoon pornography. Runs game servers. Has a Taylor Swift fetish.’’

At first, Obnoxious seemed content with just having women to talk to. ‘‘He wanted friends,’’ says K., a 22-year-old streamer in Florida. (Most of the women interviewed for this article did not want their full names used, fearing future harassment.) Then he started asking for ‘‘fan signs’’: selfies of the women holding pieces of paper with ‘‘Obnoxious’’ written on them. Some women granted this request — no big deal. Then he demanded nude pictures. He had a foot fetish. He asked them to talk about sex.

As he was asking for these things, they started to get weird messages on Skype, supposedly from their friends, but really from Obnoxious in disguise. Their chats filled with abuse from multiple screen names:

Mibbzz

im gona drive

to your house

[a friend] gave me money for the gas

and im gona pour it all over the

side of

your house

and pull out some matches

and just throw em

obnoxious send teh dox [ ... ] obnoxious

dude this guy

is hilarious FreezeD0ng

im gonna go swat myself

‘‘Dox’’ is a scary word. It’s a document of your private information posted online for anyone to see and exploit. Doxing makes you vulnerable to all sorts of mischief, from phone harassment to credit-­card fraud or worse. Obnoxious was able to obtain this sort of information for dozens of women. He mainly did it by cold-­calling Internet companies and duping customer-­service representatives over the phone. He would use one small piece of public information, a birthday or a favorite pet, to get yet another from one company, and then he would use the new piece to get more information from a different company. He had a con man’s gift for deception. Sometimes he was even able to take over a woman’s account. ‘‘He loved to tell me how he did it,’’ Janet says. ‘‘He told me that he would call customer service at Amazon, say that he forgot my password but he knows my birthday, and the Amazon people, they just give it. And if they wouldn’t, he would just call again.’’ (Amazon did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)

When the women stopped responding to him, he escalated his attacks. He told a transgender streamer named Alexa Walk that he had her medical records and knew her birth name. Then he posted her birth name on Twitter. He posted nude pictures of some women on Twitter as well. He once posted a nude shot of a 14-year-old girl and later bragged that he was a pedophile. Women reported the abuse to Twitter, but whenever Twitter banned him, he would just make a new account and continue as before.

Online abuse began to cross over into the physical world. He sent pizzas to their homes. A string of deliverymen climbed the stairs to K.’s apartment in Florida, carrying unappetizing pies: deep-dish pizza with no cheese, pizza with anchovies and jalapeños, double bacon and double pepperoni. He called their cellphones repeatedly and sent ‘‘text bombs’’ of hundreds of messages at a time. If all else failed and Obnoxious couldn’t get a hold of a woman, he would start threatening to dispatch a SWAT team to her house, or her parents’ house, or her college — a kind of intrusion that couldn’t be ignored. When Janet wouldn’t respond to his texts, he reached out to one of her friends and asked the friend to convey a message:

[1:06:17 AM] obnoxious: and if she isnt willing

[1:06:21 AM] obnoxious: to speak to [me] secretly

[1:06:23 AM] obnoxious: she is going to get

[1:06:26 AM] obnoxious: a swat team

[1:06:30 AM] obnoxious: holding them at gun point

[1:07:31 AM] obnoxious: or how

[1:07:39 AM] obnoxious: but this is last chance im giving her

[1:07:50 AM] obnoxious: be friends with me secretly or get wrecked

The SWAT team grew from the tumult of the 1960s. In Philadelphia, a string of armed robberies prompted a ‘‘stakeout’’ unit of officers who received extra weapons training; in Los Angeles, after the Watts riots of 1965, an ambitious police commander, Daryl Gates, who later became the chief of police, argued that the city needed elite officers with rifles, shotguns and armored cars, trained in military-­style tactics. Gates explained to The Los Angeles Times in 1968 that during the unrest, ‘‘suddenly we found ourselves with almost a guerrilla warfare without weaponry. ... I felt the frustration of being almost helpless.’’

At first, the SWAT idea struck some officers as strange — wouldn’t the units scare residents and damage relationships with communities? — but lax gun regulations and strict national drug laws encouraged cities and towns to invest in bigger weaponry. The ‘‘war on drugs’’ in particular pressured officers to conduct militarized drug enforcement. (Mother Jones recently analyzed 465 police requests for armored tactical vehicles that resemble small tanks, and more requests said the vehicles would be used for drug enforcement than any other reason.) And the grim logic of mass shootings and hostage situations, where seconds and minutes can matter, pushed communities to form local SWAT teams instead of relying on teams from farther away that took longer to arrive. (A recent study led by a professor at Texas State University analyzed 84 ‘‘active shooter’’ incidents from 2000 to 2010, and about half the time, the shootings were over by the time any officers arrived at the scene.) ‘‘We want to keep the community safe,’’ says the tactical commander of a SWAT team in Georgia. ‘‘And if responding in a very short time period saves lives, that’s what we want to do. And we can do that by having a team readily available. We do.’’

Through the 1990s and 2000s, SWAT teams started cropping up in smaller American towns, even in places where violent crime is fairly uncommon. According to research done by Peter Kraska, a criminologist at Eastern Kentucky University, by the mid-2000s, 80 percent of law-enforcement agencies in towns with populations of 25,000 to 50,000 had a military-­style unit, compared with just 20 percent in the mid-1980s. In the last decade, the ‘‘war on terror’’ has helped local law-­enforcement agencies acquire unprecedented firepower. One Pentagon program has sent at least $5.6 billion in equipment to police departments, including 625 armored tactical vehicles, more than 200 grenade launchers and around 80,000 assault rifles. Many people had no idea that SWAT teams owned gear like this until the protests in Ferguson, Mo., last summer, when images spread around the world of white officers confronting black protesters with tear gas and a type of armored truck called a BearCat. People all along the political spectrum expressed horror at these pictures; Senator Rand Paul wrote that ‘‘the images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.’’

Ferguson renewed a debate about the legitimacy of SWAT tools and strategies that is still being argued. Critics say SWAT teams have become like occupying forces, deploying for purposes beyond their core mission (Radley Balko, the author of ‘‘Rise of the Warrior Cop,’’ found instances of military-­style raids on nonviolent offenders like poker players and pot growers); the police say they need the teams and the weapons as deterrents and as bulwarks against the unknown.

But the unknown is where swatters step in. They exploit the ubiquity of SWAT teams and the readiness of the police to respond. The Georgia tactical commander, a veteran of the Marines, says that for planned raids, when he and his team are considering whether to deploy, they use a ‘‘matrix’’ of risk factors to decide if a SWAT response is justified: Does the suspect have a history of violence? Does the suspect have weapons? Has the suspect made threats to law enforcement? For a situation in progress, though — an emergency call — there is no time to go through all of that, and from a police point of view, it’s better to ‘‘respond high and then downgrade’’ than it is to show up unprepared. So when a situation arises with a possible active shooter, especially one who says he is heavily armed and will kill officers, dispatch sends a text to team members’ cellphones to respond to a certain address, and the police are ready for confrontation.

And when the police ‘‘respond high,’’ residents can become disoriented. Maybe they assume they are being robbed. Maybe they pick up a gun. In 2011, a former Marine and Iraq war veteran named Jose Guerena was awakened by his wife, who thought she saw intruders outside their home in Arizona. Guerena picked up his AR-15 rifle, with the safety on, to protect his wife and family. SWAT officers entered the house, saw the gun and shot Guerena dozens of times, killing him. They were conducting a drug investigation. In 2010, during a military-­style raid on a home in east Detroit, a police officer looking for a murder suspect accidentally shot and killed a 7-year-old girl while she slept.

Swatting isn’t new; law enforcement encountered a ring of swatters in the mid-2000s. But the phenomenon is touching more and more lives in more serious ways. (The F.B.I. doesn’t keep statistics on swatting incidents; a bureau spokeswoman says it is still working out which part of the F.B.I. should handle swatting investigations, because the crime ‘‘crosses so many of our delineated thresholds for who handles what.’’) Activists and political operatives on the right and the left have been swatted. Reporters writing about computer security have been swatted. Celebrities have been swatted: Ashton Kutcher, Justin Timberlake, Rihanna. Politicians trying to pass anti-­swatting bills, including a state senator in California and a state assemblyman in New Jersey, have been swatted at their homes. Video gamers, male and female, have been swatted.

While a swatting hoax is often preceded by other kinds of Internet attacks (Twitter threats, the public posting of a home address or phone number), swatting is the most troubling manifestation of online harassment, because it’s not online at all — it’s actual weapons and confusion, showing up at your door.

What a lot of the victims remember is a sense of unreality, a feeling like they were watching a movie. K. says she opened the door of her Florida apartment one evening to find a dozen SWAT officers lined up on the stairs with riot shields and black guns pointed at her. She froze and thought of the metal belt buckle she happened to be clutching in her left hand. They’re going to think I have a weapon in my hand. They’re going to shoot me.

Obnoxious often sent a text to his target telling her that the SWAT team was on its way — too late to stop it — just so she would know it was him. Sometimes victims received phone calls from the police before the SWAT team arrived. A Canadian Twitch streamer named Maple Ong got a call one night in January 2014, telling her to leave her house with her hands up, along with her panicked father and younger brother, so the police could search it for bombs that Obnoxious had told them were placed there. Allison Henderson, a 26-year-old artist and streamer who lived with two other streamers in Costa Mesa, Calif., received a phone call one night from a woman with the Police Department, asking her how many people were in her apartment and what she was wearing. Allison and her roommates had recently been DDoSed and harassed by Obnoxious. The policewoman told Allison to step outside with her hands above her head.

‘‘I held my breath and slowly opened the door to the sight of rifles pointed at me from every direction,’’ she says. ‘‘It was the most terrifying experience of my life.’’ When officers questioned her, she couldn’t make them understand. ‘‘They were completely lost on the idea of a stranger harassing us over the Internet,’’ she says. ‘‘It’s a feeling like you’re drowning, and the person doesn’t understand what water is.’’

A few months after Obnoxious swatted Janet and her family, he swatted them again. The officers who showed up this time seemed irritated at Janet, ‘‘like it was my fault that I got swatted, because I do what I do, because I play video games.’’ She says one told her, ‘‘Just pick up a book.’’ The officers who responded to these calls did a professional job — in the sense that they assessed the situation, de-­escalated it and didn’t fire their weapons. At the same time, they misjudged what they were seeing. They didn’t grasp that each swatting was merely a spike in a long-­running pattern of abuse that would continue when they drove away. ‘‘You don’t want to dwell on it,’’ says K., the Florida streamer. ‘‘You just want to go back to doing what you love. But it isn’t that simple. Because everything’s changed. As he was attacking us, we couldn’t be the same anymore.’’ Some of Obnoxious’s swatting victims took long breaks from streaming, even though it was a major social outlet and an income source for them. ‘‘I just wanted to be alone,’’ says Alexa Walk, who was swatted by Obnoxious at her apartment in North Carolina. ‘‘I didn’t want people to see me upset.’’

After being attacked, several victims reached out to Twitch, asking for information that they could give to detectives or for advice on how to protect themselves from further abuse. In early January 2014, one victim wrote to Twitch, saying that she and ‘‘a lot of other female streamers have been severely harassed and attacked by a ‘hacker’ named Obnoxious and his friends.’’ She continued: ‘‘It has gotten to the point that he is calling SWAT teams into houses. I just dealt with the SWAT team at my house.’’ A Twitch representative replied that he was aware of Obnoxious and the swattings — he had seen one victim’s anguished Facebook post — but that ‘‘in some cases, there is not a lot we can do when things happen off of our site.’’ Another Twitch representative told Jamie Lynn Greenwood, 32, a streamer who was swatted in Montana while playing Minecraft (not by Obnoxious but by someone else) and was ordered from her home at gunpoint along with her husband, ‘‘I sympathize for you going through that — best of luck to the police to catch the perpetrator!’’

(Twitch’s initial response to questions emailed by this magazine was brief. A company spokesman called swatting ‘‘an age-old stunt far from unique to Twitch’’ and claimed that swattings of Twitch broadcasters are ‘‘infrequent.’’ Later, after being told of the magnitude of the Obnoxious case, he wrote, ‘‘We are adding info about swatting as part of our Education portal, which will also have info on protection from DDoS and other common ways of being harassed.’’)

B.A. Finley, a detective sergeant with the Johns Creek Police Department outside Atlanta, had heard about swatting but never really understood it until Jan. 16, 2014. That afternoon, a man called a police line in Alpharetta, Ga., and said he had killed three people in a home in nearby Johns Creek and was holding a girl hostage. ‘‘If you send any cops here, I swear to God I’ll shoot their ass.’’ The dispatcher tried to get information as the man stammered and cursed at her. ‘‘I got the little girl right here.’’ He said he needed $30,000 or he would kill the girl, too.

Officers — including Finley — raced to the address with rifles and shotguns, unholstering loaded pistols at the scene, only to find that there was no hostage-­taker, no dead family, no emergency. There was only chaos: close to 40 responders and their vehicles, gawking neighbors, traumatized victims, everyone trying to figure out what had happened.

The hoax made the news, and the Johns Creek mayor expressed his anger publicly. Then, nine days later, the police got a second call of an emergency at the same address, this time from a different-­sounding man. ‘‘Hey, yo,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m at one of my old buddies’ house. He stole, like, ten grand from me.’’ And then: ‘‘I planted four bombs in his house.’’ It was another swatting hoax.

The police chief asked Finley to make the case his top priority, to take whatever time he needed to catch the perpetrator — a mandate that detectives, especially those looking into swatting cases, don’t often enjoy.

Finley is a tall, big-­torsoed man with a thick drawl. At that time, he didn’t have any ‘‘cyber’’ experience, in the charming archaism often used by law enforcement. But he possessed unusual patience, and this was an investigation that required a great deal of it. Neither of the caller-­ID numbers attached to the two hoax calls belonged to an individual. They had to be traced through a laby­rinth of companies that buy blocks of numbers and resell them to voice-­over-­IP providers; the only way to do this was to subpoena the companies, wait for records to come back (it could take a week), analyze the records and send out more subpoenas, court orders and search warrants — 75 of them by the end. It was all very analog; when Finley needed to update his commander on the investigation, he would print out photos of his white board on sheets of 8½-by-11 paper and tape the pages together.

By April, he had filled a conference room with stacks of documents. He asked the cleaning crew not to touch the room. He was getting somewhere. The first swatting seemed to be a one-off; it pointed to a suspect in New York. (The suspect has yet to be charged.) But the second swatting led to a bigger world of crimes. After weeks of slogging through paper, Finley linked the call to a Skype account that had also called 10 other police agencies across the United States and Canada in the same month. Finley got in touch with these agencies, and sure enough, they had received hoax emergency calls on those dates. Finley compared the recordings of some of those calls with the Georgia call. It was obviously the same suspect; he hadn’t bothered to alter his voice. He had a vocal tic that Finley kept trying to place, some slight cold-­weather quirk, as if he were from way up north, Wisconsin, maybe Canada.",REAL
Edmund de Waal and the Strange Alchemy of Porcelain,"On my last morning in London, I visited the Victoria and Albert Museum, one of the great decorative-art collections in the world. The place is like a giant display cabinet of England’s infinite treasures: Indian saris, Egyptian scepters, Persian carpets, diamond tiaras, golden Buddhas. There is an 18th-century wooden automaton of a tiger mauling a man, as well as a full-size plaster copy of Michelangelo’s David that includes (in a case nearby) the giant fig leaf commissioned to shield its genitalia from prudish Victorians. On the day I went, the museum was crowded: tourists filling the galleries, art students sprawled out sketching on the floor.

Except for the porcelain collection. If you ever want to feel alone in London, go up to the Victoria and Albert’s porcelain collection, all the way at the top of the building. It feels like a secret attic where the queen keeps her special china. There is such an insane proliferation of porcelain — precious, clean, pristine white plates and bowls and figurines, all of them protected by glass — that it becomes almost impossible to see them as individual pieces. Even the transcendently good stuff, the Ming dynasty vases and Meissen coffee pots, are so spare and fragile and cold that the eye just stares right past them as the feet walk on to the next room. Whatever cultural power the stuff once had has gone the way of corncob pipes and smelting and aristocratic Elizabethan neck ruffles.

In 2009, the museum invited de Waal to contribute a major piece to its collection. He grew up visiting the museum, so he knew its porcelain collection well. He knew its loneliness, its isolation. He came up with an ingenious solution. De Waal designed a huge red aluminum ring, 120 feet in diameter, to nest inside the museum’s dome. The red ring is actually an elegant circular shelf: inside of it, all the way around, are pieces of porcelain by de Waal, large and extremely white, inspired by the museum’s collection. There are 425 of them, flashing against the red like teeth in a violent mouth. When visitors enter the museum, on their way to the better-known galleries closer to the street, their eyes are almost inevitably drawn up to this colorful ring hanging, very distantly, over the grand lobby. It’s like the hint of a scandal up in the attic, a sudden reason to make that long trip.

‘‘The White Road,’’ de Waal’s new book, performs an analogous trick. It rescues porcelain from the cultural attic — makes the subject feel vital, modern, interactive. In the book, de Waal refers to ‘‘Moby-Dick’’ several times (the whiteness of the whale, etc.), and he writes about porcelain as Melville writes about cetaceans: as one of the central elements of the universe. Porcelain is not just porcelain, it’s the essence of displacement. Touch a piece of it, and you travel through time, place, states of being, from ancient Chinese peasants harvesting clay to German alchemists suffocating in castle basements to emperors bankrupting their kingdoms in order to feed their collections. ‘‘Porzellankrankheit,’’ Germans called it — ‘‘porcelain sickness.’’ It is a delicate subject with a feverish history.

De Waal has his own special case of porcelain sickness, of course, and in ‘‘The White Road,’’ he follows it around the world. He visits primordial white hills in China, France, Germany and England. For 500 years, de Waal writes, the West had no idea how porcelain was made: People speculated that it was the crushed-up umbilical cords of fish that had been buried underground for decades. In fact, it is only clay. But it is clay of a very special kind: an extremely smooth combination of two minerals, petunse and kaolin, mined separately and mixed together in exactly the right proportions. When fired at extremely high temperatures, porcelain clay fuses into a kind of glass, hard and white but still slightly translucent. It is this paradoxical combination of qualities — hardness, softness, solidity, translucence — that has made people throughout history go so bananas.

‘‘The White Road’’ is a book of excess. It goes too far. It gets lost. It repeats itself. De Waal takes us all over the world, all over history: Jesuit priests, Spinoza, Constantinople, manhunts, self-immolation, Hitler, Cherokees, Quakers, modern Chinese street vendors selling ‘‘sixteenth-century porcelains from last week.’’ His prose style is like his pot style: He gets drunk on simplicity, on repetition. ‘‘The car turns off the new highway on to the old road and off the old road on to the old track rising between two farmers’ houses.’’ It could have been an easier book, more linear and contained. But then ‘‘Moby-Dick’’ could have been easier, too. One of de Waal’s core beliefs is that messes are interesting. There’s so much to feel inside of them.

De Waal is an evangelist of touch. As he wrote in ‘‘The Hare With Amber Eyes’’: ‘‘Touch tells you what you need to know: it tells you about yourself.’’ As he writes in ‘‘The White Road’’: ‘‘Thinking is through the hands as well as the head.’’ Hands are the great universal human fact. Our opposable thumbs are the tools that helped launch us out of the forests and into the world we know now. Some of the earliest art is simply handprints on cave walls — a high-five across 30,000 years. Even in our postmodern, postindustrial, increasingly virtual digital world, we depend on our fingertips to decode for us, instantly, the crucial outlines of our environment: whether an object is hot or cold, whether it’s something to drink or peel or squeeze, something your teeth will be able to penetrate, a volume button or a power switch. We are still affectionate animals who greet each other with hands: handshakes, fist bumps, high-fives, hugs.

De Waal’s hands are rapturously attentive to the weight, grain, proportions and personalities of objects. For years, he says, he could remember every single pot he ever touched. In the same way that Bobby Fischer could run into someone at a tournament and say, about a game they had played 15 years earlier, ‘‘You should have moved your bishop to e7,’’ de Waal can recall exactly the way a particular vase swelled or tapered toward its rim, or if the heft of a teakettle was particularly well-balanced. Recently, he says, his memory has filled up, and old pots have started to drop out of it.

De Waal worries that modern humans are beginning to lose our fluency in touch. He thinks that we live in a world impoverished by a lack of attention to tactility. Our culture has a deeply embedded shame of the body, shame of skin, shame of ‘‘mere’’ sensation — a desire to transcend the animal coarseness of nerves, hair, blood flow. To live in clean, noble abstractions: things that we think will last. All of our digital technology, all of these portable virtual worlds, only make it easier to live in touchlessness. If you put on virtual-reality goggles, there will be plenty to look at and pretend to touch, but nothing to actually feel. But touch, de Waal insists, is fundamental to the human experience. If we can’t fully inhabit and value the world of touchable objects, de Waal told me, then we can’t fully value other human beings.

Despite our culture’s squeamishness, there is no escape from touch, and there is no escape from time, and these two facts are intimately related. All of the hands that exist today, all of the objects they will ever touch, will someday, not long from now, be gone. All we can do, in the meantime, is to be fully present in the world we have — to roll it, insistently, in our fingers — and, in doing so, to light up as many of the nodes along the continuum of time that we can: the absent uncles and workmen and lovers and thieves, the people who held the world before any of us were here to hold it, and, if we’re lucky, the people who will hold it when we are finally gone. Although de Waal often writes about objects, what he is really writing about is the power of presence, of intimacy. As he puts it at the end of ‘‘The White Road’’: ‘‘It is this consolation, someone walking part of the way by your side, that means almost everything. Everything.’’

On my second afternoon at the studio, the 58 pots de Waal made the day before had dried to their optimal texture — potters call it ‘‘leather hard,’’ or ‘‘cheese hard.’’ And so de Waal started cutting them. He slapped them back on the wheel and, as they spun, trimmed off excess clay with a set of tools that reminded me of dental equipment. He bent himself in half again, and his head bobbed slightly in rhythm with the spinning wheel, and ribbons of wet clay spun off the pots. Occasionally he would pick up a little sponge and dab, mysteriously, at the rim. When all the excess clay had been trimmed, de Waal pulled the pot off the wheel and, with a knife, cut his characteristic little scallops out of the base. This is one of his signatures, these dents and caves. De Waal cut quickly, intuitively, like someone paring an apple. He was not precious about it, not terribly serious, just matter-of-factly doing what his hands told him was the right thing for each pot. He could have been whittling sticks by a lake.

I kept asking questions about how he decided what and where to cut. Why that spot and not this one? Why deep and not shallow? He said he was just trying to bring the outside of the pot into the proper relationship to its inside. O.K., yes, sure, I said. But why did you make that particular cut? And why did you make that one?

After a while, de Waal responded by handing me one of the pots — fresh, cheese-dry, ready to cut. He handed me the knife. ‘‘Cut it,’’ he said. This seemed sacrilegious, but he insisted. So I did. I tried to emulate his cutting: to whittle out small slivers that added texture without ruining everything. The first pot I tried turned out O.K. De Waal said that my largest cut had a nice ‘‘authority’’ to it.

The second pot, however, I completely destroyed. I carved out so many hunks of wet porcelain that there was almost nothing left — a little nub, all angles. Ruination. De Waal seemed to agree. But he also seemed equally satisfied with both pots, the success and the failure. He set them both on the board to dry.",REAL
Bob Mankoff Thinks Cats Are Funnier Than Dogs,"What’s the difference between the cartoons that you put in the magazine and those that go in the caption contest? The caption-contest cartoons are not great cartoons. We usually pick a submission that we don’t particularly like and take the caption off. Most cartoonists are perfectly fine with that. I often say the difference between an amateur and a professional is that an amateur really likes everything they do.

Are you familiar with the theory of the universal New Yorker cartoon caption: that there’s one caption that could work for every single cartoon? Oh, am I ever. One recent suggestion was, “I’d like to add you to my professional network on LinkedIn.” I have a meeting every week with David Remnick, and he makes the final decisions on the cartoons. For the first 10 I showed him, I printed the LinkedIn caption on all of them. David said, “What the [expletive] is this?”

Did he publish one? I explained it, and he said, “Let’s use one.” One of the interesting things about humor now is that it’s so pervasive, it can make fun of itself.

In the movie, I noticed that among the cartoonists pitching to you, there wasn’t a single person of color. Unless off-white is a color, I think you’re right. We’ve been pushing for more diversity. There’s not that many cartoonists in the world, O.K.? It’s not incredibly remunerative, so you’re not going to make an awful lot of money. But we’re trying.

There was a recent survey of last year’s cartoons, which found that around 94 percent of the characters in the cartoons are white. And I think an awful lot of them are Jewish, too.

This might get you in trouble: Do dogs or cats make better cartoon material? No question, cats. We can project so much more onto cats. If you look back at the history of New Yorker cartoons, in the ’20s and ’30s, the cats and dogs don’t talk. And once they really start talking, in the ’40s, they don’t shut up.

My Life as a Muslim in the West’s ‘Gray Zone’,"It was probably not a coincidence that the Paris attacks were aimed at restaurants, a concert hall and a sports stadium, places of leisure and community, nor that the victims included Muslims. As Dabiq makes clear, ISIS wants to eliminate coexistence between religions and to create a response from the West that will force Muslims to choose sides: either they “apostatize and adopt” the infidel religion of the crusaders or “they perform hijrah to the Islamic State and thereby escape persecution from the crusader governments and citizens.” For ISIS to win, the gray zone must be eliminated.

Whose lives are gray? Mine, certainly. I was born in one nation (Morocco) speaking Arabic, came to my love of literature through a second language (French) and now live in a third country (America), where I write books and teach classes in yet another language (English). I have made my home in between all these cultures, all these languages, all these countries. And I have found it a glorious place to be. My friends are atheists and Muslims, Jews and Christians, believers and doubters. Each one makes my life richer.

This gray life of mine is not unique. I share it with millions of people around the world. My brother in Dallas is a practicing Muslim — he prays, he fasts, he attends mosque — but he, too, would be considered to be in the gray zone, because he despises ISIS and everything it stands for.

Most of the time, gray lives go unnoticed in America. Other times, especially when people are scared, gray lives become targets. Hate crimes against Muslims spike after every major terrorist attack. But rather than stigmatize this hate, politicians and pundits often stoke it with fiery rhetoric, further diminishing the gray zone. Every time the gray zone recedes, ISIS gains ground.

The language that ISIS uses may be new, but the message is not. When President George W. Bush spoke to a joint session of Congress after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, he declared, “Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.” It was a decisive threat, and it worked well for him in those early, confusing days, so he returned to it. “Either you are with us,” he said in 2002, “or you are with the enemy. There’s no in between.” This polarized thinking led to the United States invasion of Iraq, which led to the destabilization of the Middle East, which in turn led to the creation of ISIS.

Terrorist attacks affect all of us in the same way: We experience sorrow and anger at the loss of life. For Muslims, however, there is an additional layer of grief as we become subjects of suspicion. Muslims are called upon to condemn terrorism, but no matter how often or how loud or how clear the condemnations, the calls remain. Imagine if, after every mass shooting in a school or a movie theater in the United States, young white men in this country were told that they must publicly denounce gun violence. The reason this is not the case is that we presume each young white man to be solely responsible for his actions, whereas Muslims are held collectively responsible. To be a Muslim in the West is to be constantly on trial.

The attacks in Paris have generated the same polarization as all previous attacks have. Even though most of the suspects were French and Belgian nationals who could have gained entry to the United States on their passports, Republican governors in 30 states say that they will refuse to take in any refugees from Syria without even more stringent screening. Barely two days after the attacks, Jeb Bush told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the United States should focus its efforts only on helping Syrian refugees who are Christian.

Ted Cruz went a step further, offering to draft legislation that would ban Muslim Syrian refugees from the United States. When he was asked by Dana Bash of CNN what would have happened to him if his father, a Cuban refugee who was fleeing communism, had been refused entry, he implied that it was a different situation because of the special risks associated with ISIS.

As it happens, I am married to a son of Cuban refugees. Like Cruz’s father, they came to this country because America was a safe haven. What would have been their fate if an American legislator said that they could not be allowed in because the Soviet Union was trying to infiltrate the United States?

The other day, my daughter said to me, “I want to be president.” She has been saying this a lot lately, usually the morning after a presidential debate, when our breakfast-table conversation veers toward the elections. My daughter is 12. She plays the violin and the guitar; she loves math and history; she’s quick-witted and sharp-tongued and above all she’s very kind to others. “I’d vote for you,” I told her. And then I looked away, because I didn’t have the heart to tell her that half the people in this country — in her country — say they would not vote for a Muslim presidential candidate.

I worry about her growing up in a place where some of the people who are seeking the highest office in the land cannot make a simple distinction between Islam and ISIS, between Muslim and terrorist. Ben Carson has said he “would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.”

Right now, my daughter still has the innocence and ambition that are the natural attributes of the young. But what will happen when she comes of age and starts to realize that her life, like mine, is constantly under question? How do you explain to a child that she is not wanted in her own country? I have not yet had the courage to do that. My daughter has never heard of the gray zone, though she has lived in it her entire life. Perhaps this is my attempt at keeping the world around all of us as gray as possible. It is a form of resistance, the only form of resistance I know.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Kitchen Timer,"Photo

It began, as many habits do, in desperation. In my first year of working from home, I had discovered how crucial it was that I stay fastened to my desk. This sounded simple, but it was, in fact, as difficult to accomplish as it would have been at a desk on a ship caught in a typhoon. Never before had I felt so many gusts of trivial desire: I needed to buy stamps at the post office, to dust the window sills, to locate the jump-rope I was fairly sure I’d left in the back of the closet.

Fed up with my flightiness, I ordered from Amazon a simple white kitchen timer — nearly identical to the one that sat neglected in a kitchen drawer throughout my entire childhood — and I made a resolution: When it came time to work each morning, I would set the timer for no more than an hour, and then, barring fire or bodily emergency, I would not budge.

To my surprise and delight, this hunk of Chinese-made plastic proved a capable tyrant. To be exactly 43 minutes from my next break — a break that would itself be of a discrete length — was, it turned out, vastly more bearable than having to decide over and over whether a particular impulse was worth following, whether a creative impasse was the kind that you ought to surrender to or the kind that you ought to overcome. To my mind’s perpetual, child-in-the-back-seat questioning (Can we get up yet? Can we get up yet?), I had finally discovered a stern answer: ‘‘Has the timer run down? Then, no, we can’t.’’

Soon my timer annexed new territory. It followed me into the kitchen, where I used it less for cooking (though it did make the eight minutes it takes to cook a box of Annie’s mac and cheese easier to endure) than for cleaning. What an enormous, hopeless burden it seemed to do the dishes — but how light and manageable it sounded to clean for 15 minutes. A sauce-crusted pan, formerly an enemy to be wrestled into submission, became a collaborator capable of relieving me of six or seven of my designated minutes. Each herb- and oil-flecked counter came to represent not a grotesque rectangle of mouse bait but rather a means of disappearing 30 seconds with vigorous paper towel work. And as the 15 minutes neared its end, a pleasurable beat-the-clock anxiety entered my cleaning: I’ve got less than a minute to unload the rest of this silverware! The mind (or anyway my mind) is, in its satisfactions, a happy idiot.

The Pomodoro technique, popularized in the 1990s, calls for the use of tomato-shaped kitchen timers to break up tasks into manageable 25-minute chucks, or “pomodoros,” as below: Tidy sock drawer:

1 pomodoro

Call your mother:

2 pomodoros

File taxes:

31 pomodoros

Read “War and Peace”:

78 pomodoros

As more of my activities fell under my timer’s gaze, I began to notice something interesting: My inner sense of time had, thanks to years of not having its work checked, become deeply warped. Five minutes on the Internet, as measured by my timer, would pass in what seemed to me about 35 seconds. A timed hour of research would seem to take between three and four hours. My timer was a crisp metal yardstick laid down in the fog of my temporal intuitions.

The Winter Hat Trick,"Photo

Here they come now, winter hats, making their annual flight from the recesses of our closets to the crests of our persons. The plain-­spoken stocking caps, the trapper hats, the rabbit-­fur fantasia — to watch these and a hundred other designs re-­enter circulation is at once to witness the most natural thing in the world and to size up something strange. Hats seem essential in frigid air, but many seem ­impossible to wear with a straight face, given the cultural climate. Get a whiff of the models that served our grandfathers well: They now combine the must of a midcentury hatbox with the musk of 21st-­century body spray. Take a look at the grown-­ups wearing wool caps decorated to the verge of doubling as stuffed animals. The impish self-­consciousness of such nonsense shows that gussying up the head is, however awkward, serious business.

Donning a hat for the winter was much more straightforward a century ago. In many American cities, the 15th of September stood acknowledged as Felt Hat Day. Men discarded the straw hats that had seen them through summer and began sporting heartier replacements — a practice once enforced, in 1922, by roving mobs who snatched and smashed the straw hats of laggards, a perversion of etiquette indicating the severity of social regulation. Of course, 1922 was a long time ago — longer yet when we consider that ideas of hat etiquette extended from a millenniums-­old tradition in which the primary function of the hat was to signal rank, with protection from the elements a chief consideration of only those with a very meager claim to status.

Then a casualty of casualness, hats went out, though without going away. The importance of the hat declined sharply, but its prominence could not; it’s right there on your skull, which encases a brain that maybe isn’t sure how to reconcile the desire to be cozy and the need to project a proud presence. The beret with its sensuous slouch, the hunter’s cap summoning the sputtering ghost of Elmer Fudd, the beanie that appears tossed on as an afterthought: These cannot help looking like extensions of minds making claims about who we think we are.

The simplest defense against the elements must be the woolen knit cap. It matches your go-­to coat or perhaps extravagantly fails to match it, which is its own sort of harmony. Perhaps it is not worn with a coat at all, as when coddling the scalp of an Angeleno who coordinates it with well-­tended stubble. It was once famous as the Monmouth cap, which connects it to the Welsh town whence it emerged. But it is also known as a watch cap, which connects it to sailors and the work-­wear sensibility that so dominates the contemporary business of getting dressed. The peacoats, the lumberjack plaids, the engineer’s boots, the egalitarian affectation: The watch cap coordinates with these, even when woven from cashmere.

This is the modern standard, virtuous in its blankness — a status-­neutral hat.

Decorated with slogans, it speaks the language of a chatty T-­shirt. Pulled back so that its tip flops aside in a grunge-­chic droop that is nonetheless somewhat Smurf-like, it suggests youthful insouciance. However it is worn — snug and action-­star tough, or pert and go-­getter jaunty, or with its cuff carefully skewed to imitate devil-­may-­care rakishness — it looks democratic. It is built for lying low and blending in.",REAL

When the couple moved to the area 20 years ago, it was still “very transitional.” Their neighbors included a coffee-roasting plant and metal-plating companies. The concrete-block house was an industrial structure, too, designed in 1983 by the modernist architect Harry Weese in collaboration with his daughter Marcia Weese and her husband, Dan Yarbrough, a sculptor, for use as an artist’s studio. The Arnetts slowly transformed the property into a warm family home, most recently with a new addition. Hawks, flicker woodpeckers, rabbits and other wildlife inhabit the property, a third of an acre. “It’s a sort of urban oasis,” Arnett says.

“We did not aspire to live in a stark, modernist house,” Arnett says. “Art is the thread between the new space and the old.”",REAL
Drinking Food,"We spooned the yolks onto the rice at Shimoki’s instruction and pierced them with our chopsticks. They were firm at the edges but ran thick and molten at the center. The yolks enrobed the rice, staining it a marvelous hue. And the silky, strong taste of it all was revelatory: salty and rich, like an oceanic butter. The table went quiet, and for some time, we just shoveled the rice and yolks into our mouths, drinking sake and eating some more.

Photo

Shimoki has some of the aspects of a teddy bear beneath his generally serious, concentrated mien, and he shrugged slightly in response to the widened eyes that stared at him. ‘‘Drinking food,’’ he said, to some laughter. It was the sake’s perfect match — a good snack or light dinner to repeat monthly at least.

Making the yolks myself took a few weeks to master. The first lesson was: Use the freshest eggs you can find. This is not a recipe that rewards the eggs you bought two weeks ago for omelets. To pickle Kirshner’s, which were straight from the coop, Shimoki used the soy sauce he had brought from home, a variety brewed in Ishikawa, thick and quite sweet. He marinated the yolks in it for more than 12 hours, along with that small strip of kombu, which imparted a crucial, sea-vegetal umami to the sauce. I used a blend of tamari and mirin, the sweet rice wine, to achieve a similar consistency and taste, then altered the ratio over the course of a few dozen eggs, starting with a one-to-one mix of soy and mirin and moving eventually to something between three to one and four to one. (Using a light Japanese soy sauce infused with mirin did not quite work — too assertive.)

For the kombu, I used the kelp sold in the international aisle of my local supermarket (you can also buy it online). You can use a damp towel to wipe the kelp down before adding it to the marinade, as some Japanese cooks prescribe, but I found no real difference in flavor either way.

As for the period the yolks spent pickling, I tried ranges from six hours to three days, watching the yolks firm up and darken over time. Those interested in experimentation may wish to do the same (at three days, I could practically grate the egg over the rice). My preference fell to eight or nine hours, so that the yolks were creamy, with a slightly firm skin. Your mileage may vary. But going long with the curing may recall Yosa Buson, the 18th-century Japanese poet:

At the over-matured sushi,

The Master

Should My Rich Friends Apply for Financial Aid?,"But when costly private schools provide financial aid, it’s up to them to decide how a family’s ability to pay determines what breaks it gets. Are the friends in question planning to fill in the forms truthfully? Then there’s no reason they shouldn’t apply, whatever their quotient of bling. Eligibility requirements, properly designed, don’t shut out poorer families by allowances made to better-­off applicants. (In cases where many or even most parents don’t pay full fees, the sticker price can be thought of as a surcharge on the wealthy.) Besides, with those four children they’re intending to send to private school, I see less Fendi in your friends’ future.

I have been working as a freelance editor for more than 15 years. I have a steady group of local and regional clients, who keep me quite busy with work most of the time, and I make a decent hourly wage for this profession. This year, I began working for an online ‘‘crowdsourcing’’ enterprise that employs hundreds — maybe thousands — of people around the world. Here’s how it works: Once you pass the qualifying tests, you see tasks appear online, and you compete with everyone else to click on a particular task. If you click first, you get to perform the task. Each task pays between 1 cent and several dollars, depending on its complexity and the expertise it requires. I enjoy doing these tasks because they are short and quickly finished, and they offer a change of pace from my other work. Every morning, the company deposits the previous day’s earnings into my PayPal account. I do these tasks during my down time between projects, viewing the money I earn as a supplement. I’ll most likely use this money for holiday shopping.

But the work is irregular. Some days, no tasks appear, and I earn nothing or only a few cents; the most I’ve made in a day is about $50. When I read through this company’s worker forums, I note that for some workers, this is their only source of income, and they are trying to earn enough to pay rent or buy groceries or medicine for their children. So every time I successfully click on a task, especially on those days when the tasks are sparse, am I denying someone the chance to earn money? Is it unethical of me to compete with people for online tasks, knowing that others may need the money more desperately than I do? Barbara Walsh, Madison, Wis.

It’s thoughtful of you to raise this question. But what would happen if you pulled out of the competition? In some cases, surely, you would be handing the task to someone who needed it less than you. (And we would need some interesting theory to figure out how to measure greater need.) Let’s assume, though, that you would marginally raise the probability that someone who needed the money more would get it. That’s still not a reason to opt out. A well-­designed site will tend to allocate tasks to those who have the strongest desire to do them, because those people are likelier to be hovering over the site to see what turns up. Your opting out isn’t going to have much impact on any one person.

I was surprised recently when I received an email from a friend (‘‘M.J.’’) at work that came with an attachment of M.J.’s child’s college essay to M.J.’s alma mater. I didn’t know how to respond. I’m pretty sure (based on something said in the email) that the child doesn’t know M.J. sent the essay. I don’t know why my friend sent the essay, other than maybe out of honest pride. No feedback was requested. If the child didn’t know, then, as my daughter pointed out, my reading the essay certainly qualifies as an ethics fail, but at least I didn’t send the thing out.

I sure didn’t show my parents my applications, and my (now-­grown) daughter showed us hers only after printing them out for proofreading purposes. Do PDFs, tweets, emails and electronic applications mean that the ethics of what is assumed private and confidential are somehow more difficult to nail down? This wasn’t as awful as posting the essay on Facebook, but ... . Name Withheld

A proud parent shows a friend the child’s handiwork. What could be more commonplace? You suspect that M.J. may have been violating the privacy of his or her child. I wonder. Your conclusion depends a good deal on the nature of their relationship. Absent any reason to think that M.J. wasn’t entitled to share the essay, you did nothing wrong in reading it. Even if M.J.’s child hadn’t been asked, I don’t know that it was all that serious an offense. No doubt circulating stuff that makes family members look good can embarrass them. But at least in my family, it’s mostly fast forgiven. If kvelling were a crime, most parents would be in the hoosegow.

Still, the general issue you raise is a good one. The ease of hitting the forwarding button means that people are distributing all kinds of things without reflecting about whether they’re violating the privacy of others or failing obligations of confidentiality. Think before you send.

The New York Times recently exposed the systematic abuse of workers at nail salons. What is an ethical person who also likes a good mani-­pedi to do? I thought I could just tip big, but how do I know if the workers are allowed to keep their tips? If we all boycott, they eventually lose their jobs, such as they are. If I try to ask on the side whether they are being treated well, I risk getting them in trouble. What do you suggest? B.L., Connecticut

Given your concerns, I wouldn’t rule out talking to your manicurist, discreetly. And you could increase the odds that your tip goes to its intended recipient by giving it directly to the worker — not tipping via your credit card or even via an envelope slipped into a central box. A large-­enough tip could ensure that the person who did your mani-­pedi was properly paid at least for the hour she was with you. A real solution, though, is to support politicians who will work to secure not just a reasonable minimum hourly wage for all who work in our communities but also a proper enforcement of labor laws.",REAL

Joe writes: My friend insists that we high-five and then snap our fingers when saying goodbye, as he did with his friends back in Emporia, Kan. He’s so pushy that I now refuse to high-­five. I instead offer a fist bump or a choice ‘‘Cool Runnings’’ quote. I’ve never seen anyone sadder to get a fist bump.

Even though you refer to a movie from 1993, I have to imagine you’re still young. I mean I have to. If you’re 25, your letter is a touching story about the lost rituals of youth. If you’re 45, then: weird. Either way, I rule in your favor. No one should live under the shadow of another’s high-five. It’s time to develop your own farewell traditions — maybe ones that are less about ironic movie quotes and more about sincere connection in the face of your growing adult knowledge that we are all dying, and Emporia is far, far away.",REAL
‘Sleep Apnea’,"Night after night, when I was a child, I woke to the guttering candle of my father’s breath. It made a sound like the starlings that sometimes got caught in our chimney, a chirping that would gradually, steadily build to a desperate, flat slapping of wings, then suddenly drop into silence, into the thick soot at the bottom of midnight. No silence was ever so deep. And then, after maybe a minute or two, I would hear a twitter as he came to life again, and could at last take a breath for myself, a sip like a toast, lifting a chilled glass of air, wishing us courage, those of us lying awake through those hours, my mother, my sister and I, who each night listened to death kiss the fluttering lips of my father, who slept through it all.",REAL
Standing Watch Over a New Life,"That building was robbed often in those days, but still the security company didn’t give us anything: No gun. No baton. No panic button. All I could do was reach for my phone.

“You better go now,” I told him. I tried to sound calm. “I’m calling the police.”

It was a strange moment. For a second, I saw myself from above — trying to protect a place I did not even care about, for a salary that wasn’t even enough to live on.

Before I came to South Africa, I was at a refugee camp in Mozambique for six months. From that camp you could see a certain mountain. The shape of it was like a woman lying down. People there told me that if you go beyond that mountain, you’re in South Africa. They said it was a place where they take care of refugees. In South Africa, I heard, you could have a regular job and a regular life.

What they didn’t say was that to officially become a refugee in South Africa, you must go to the immigration office every day and wait in a line that never moves. You must sleep there, with newspapers for blankets, so that you don’t lose your spot. They also didn’t say that even when you have papers, the only jobs you can get are the ones South Africans don’t want, like helping park cars for small tips. That’s what I did when I first arrived. Some days I worked a whole day and came home with only 20 rand ($1.50).

In eastern Congo, I ran eight English schools, and I translated for the United Nations. But when I am at work here, people address me as though I were a child. If you sit the wrong way, they dock your pay. If you forget your name tag, they dock your pay. It’s not right, but they know they can do it, because if you lose the job, there are so many others like you waiting to take your place.

I didn’t want to lose the job, though. I have a family. My wife was very nearly a doctor in Congo when we had to leave. Now she’s trying to make money by selling perfumes at a market. We have a daughter too, Bernice. She is 8 months old and very serious. Often I think about how far I am from where I thought I would be in life. But in better moments, I think that isn’t important. We aren’t just carrying ourselves. There are many others who depend on us for a ride. I cannot be broken, or my family will be broken, too.

That’s why I needed to make this man leave. He was watching me, waiting to see what I would do.

I dialed the police number and put the phone to my ear. It rang one time, then two, then three. No answer.

“Hello?” I said anyway. I was speaking too loudly. I had to convince him that there was someone on the other end. “I’m calling to report a robbery.”

I don’t know if he believed me, but I could see he was nervous. The police aren’t kind to foreigners in this country, but they aren’t much better to locals. I guess that’s why he didn’t wait around to see if I was bluffing. He turned, and he walked away.

After that, I was alone again. That’s how it is most of the time working overnight security. Not scary, just lonely. I have more time to think than a person probably ever should.",REAL
How to Navigate By the Stars,"Photo

‘‘Use the stars to find the four cardinal directions,’’ says Chadd Onohi Paishon, a master navigator with the Polynesian Voyaging Society who steers double-hulled canoes from Hawaii to Tahiti and beyond without any instruments or charts. Paishon doesn’t know how to use a GPS device or a magnetic compass, but he can orient himself on land or sea with a glance at the heavens. Determine north by finding the North Star, which does not set when you’re north of the Equator. As seafarers have done for millenniums, you can determine about how many miles north of the Equator you are by measuring the distance between the North Star and the horizon. To do this, stretch out your arm. For most, one fist equals approximately 10 degrees; latitudinal degrees each represent about 69 miles. The farther north you go, the higher the star looks in the sky. South of the Equator, you won’t see the North Star but must rely on a constellation called the Southern Cross to help you find south.

As the earth rotates, all the other stars seem to be circling these celestial poles, rising in the east and setting in the west. Look for these other stars at the horizon, not straight above you. ‘‘A star at its zenith is not very useful for navigation,’’ Paishon says. The view is best — often clear, without much ambient light — between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Paishon often telephones the four other master navigators on the Hawaiian Islands during those hours, knowing they, too, may be out stargazing. Still, don’t forget the stars during the day. When the sun is out, Paishon imagines their approximate position in a dark sky visible on the other side of the globe. This mental tracking will make you better at predicting the stars’ whereabouts and, by extension, your own. ‘‘You should know exactly where in the sky to expect a star to rise,’’ Paishon says.

Wayfinding via celestial bodies is probably most useful on open water, but they’re good for more commonplace positioning too. Whenever he leaves Hawaii, Paishon feels unsettled until he sees the night sky and can pinpoint the exact direction back to the Big Island. ‘‘Stars are my friends,’’ Paishon says. ‘‘When they show up, I’m like: ‘Hey, how have you been? What have you been up to?’ ’’",REAL

RE: THE FUTURE

For the Future Issue, the magazine considered ways to think about the future, instead of assuming anyone knew what was to come. Jon Gertner wrote about the secrets in the earth’s ice: Scientists are studying it in an effort to determine how much time we have to respond to sea-level rise, or whether it’s already too late. Jennifer Kahn investigated Crispr, a revolutionary — but ethically slippery — technique for genetic engineering.

Articles about changing ice sheets either tilt toward the hyperbolic, which ultimately undermines their impact among those skeptical of the science, or toward the political, which does the public’s understanding of scientific investigation further disservice. This ice article, by contrast, takes a refreshingly rational approach, by breaking down the complex science and lucidly explaining its likely implications.

Thank you for not only presenting the science to the public, but also for introducing the scientists as neither superheroes nor hyperventilating partisans. Reed Scherer, Distinguished Research Professor, Geology and Environmental Geosciences, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Ill.

The scientist at the heart of the excellent ice piece was quoted as saying, ‘‘The obvious way to avoid a grim and flooded future would be to drastically curtail our carbon-dioxide emissions.’’

The quickest and most effective way to do this would be to impose a national tax on carbon emissions. The fairest way to do that would be to refund all the money collected to taxpayers on an equal basis. This should be something that all rational Democrats and Republicans can agree on. Dennis Thompson, Santa Barbara, Calif.

Seemingly an afterthought, Kahn concludes with a concern that Crispr may lead us to a eugenicslike situation wherein we attempt to cure genetic mutations that many (but not all) see as disabilities. Although a future that includes Crispr will necessarily raise these questions, we need not wait for that particular technology to come of age. We already have the ability, through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (P.G.D.), to make similar eugenic decisions today, by selecting, for I.V.F. implantation, only those embryos lacking an undesired disability. And like Crispr, P.G.D. also pre­sents us with a not-so-far-fetched alternative concern that parents will actively select for embryos that have a trait that most, but not all, would consider a disability. This raises nontrivial legal, ethical and social concerns that ought to be dealt with today, before the power of Crispr and related technologies become widely available. Dov Greenbaum, Assistant Professor, Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, Lawrence, N.Y.

It’s certainly interesting to wonder what our future will look like, but for me it is equally fascinating to consider how the future will view the present. If pressed to differentiate between, say, the years 1120 and 1195, many of us might say, what’s the difference, really? After all, that’s only a 75-year span. Even the years between 1815 and 1890 — another 75-year span — might for many of us seem basically analogous. So when future generations look back, is it not possible that they’ll simply lump 2015 together with 1940? Watch any movie musical from 1940 (or any movie, for that matter) or read any newspaper, and the urge may be to shout to future observers that 1940 and 2015 have very little in common. Or do they? Maybe that will be for future observers to decide. Joel Samberg, Avon, Conn.

RE: LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

Rachel Monroe extols the ‘‘Death in ... ’’ books, which chronicle death in American national parks.

Photo

Rachel Monroe’s story about ‘‘Death in ... ’’ books allows my family to confess a secret guilty pleasure. Several years ago we went to the Grand Canyon on spring break. My wife and I prepared our two preteens with tales of grand vistas and amazing hikes. When we got there, a weather front had moved in and the clouds and fog reduced the visibility to near-zero, with snow and sleet forecast the rest of the week. Our two children had the look of betrayal that every parent knows. The park ranger told us that it wasn’t uncommon to have a late-afternoon clearing, so we decided to stay for the day anyway. Killing time in the gift shop, I stumbled upon ‘‘Death in the Grand Canyon.’’ To make a long story short, we spent the afternoon with me reading aloud tales of fathers doing foolish things and killing themselves, much to my children’s delight. ‘‘The Cat in the Hat’’ it was not, but it saved the day, and at 4 p.m. the clouds parted and we got our majestic views. Dave Kanzler, Oak Brook, Ill.",REAL
The Women of Hollywood Speak Out,"In Hollywood, they now talk about ‘‘the Lena Dunham effect’’ and ‘‘the Jill Soloway effect’’: Studios are starting to search for female-driven shows and recruit women to create them. In their ‘‘Odd Couple’’ trailers — one O.C.D. neat, one tousled — on different coasts, Dunham and Soloway have been plotting insurrection and nurturing female directors.

Studio heads may have no choice but to listen. As Kathleen Kennedy told me: ‘‘I had an agent pitching directors to me recently, and when he got done, I waited, and then I said, ‘So, do you represent any women?’ He said, ‘Oh, mmmmm.’ I had to bring it up. I think you’ve got to put pressure on them.’’ Tom Rothman, chairman of Sony Pictures, recently told The Hollywood Reporter: ‘‘There’s a myth in the business that young males drive the box office. Maybe a decade ago or so that was true. I don’t find that true now at all. I actually think women drive the box office.’’ For the moment, it seems the bandwagon is rolling. ‘‘All of a sudden, we’re in this era of, ‘Oh, my God, girls,’ ’’ Pascal told me. ‘‘It’ll last about as long as it always does: about five more minutes.’’

Soloway has become a gleeful militant with a ‘‘messianic, feminist, patriarchy-toppling dream.’’ The mother of two sons, one a 7-year-old, she wants to put a nursery on her set and has been lobbying the D.G.A. to allow two directors per episode for more flex time.

The kids question is a significant one. Several top executives talk about the problem of female directors dropping out to have families. And there is still such an atmosphere of fear that many female directors told me they hide their pregnancies until the last possible minute. One director confessed that she actually hides her child, refusing to put a photo of her son on Facebook, fearing ‘‘it could end my career.’’

‘‘I’ve even had women executives say to me, not realizing I was a mom, ‘We always want to work with women filmmakers, but then they have kids,’ ’’ says Marielle Heller, who also directed last summer’s critically acclaimed ‘‘The Diary of a Teenage Girl.’’ ‘‘It’s a real stigma, which I think is not fair. It’s crazy to me that that’s the excuse because nobody ever asks men who have kids whether they’ll be able to do it.’’

Over lemonade at Le Pain Quotidien on Melrose Avenue, Gina Prince-Bythewood, in gilt Wonder Woman kicks, said that when she was shooting ‘‘The Secret Life of Bees’’ in North Carolina, her husband back in L.A. told her that her younger son, now 11, was walking around the house with a toy phone having a pretend conversation with her. ‘‘I had a lot of guilt; it wrecked me,’’ said the 46-year-old, who also has a 14-year-old son. ‘‘But I’m a director, and I need to feed that part of me.’’

For nearly six months now, I’ve had the voices of Prince-Bythewood and many other talented women echoing in my head. I hear them puzzling about the disparity problem and dissecting it, trying to find a way around it or plotting to go head-on against it. Dunham talks about quotas. Others pin their hopes on web disruption with new studios at Netflix and Amazon.

But, as Prince-Bythewood says, the studios should open the door for women who are in love with film and with storytelling. ‘‘Just get us in the room,’’ she says.

Leigh Janiak is a 35-year-old with a laid-back manner, but you sense immediately that she knows where she’s going. Janiak pragmatically plotted her rise while she was a producer’s assistant for Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company. She refused an offer to direct an episode of a network TV show on the condition that she shadow a veteran director first. She was afraid it would stigmatize her.

‘‘Why would anyone give me $40 million to get a movie off the ground if just last week I was doing this little training program?’’ she asked, over lunch at Little Dom’s in Los Feliz. She knew that guys who made horror and science-fiction movies could make the jump to blockbusters more easily than women who wrote rom-coms could. With her writing partner, she did a $1 million horror movie, ‘‘Honeymoon,’’ a goosebumps-inducing something-bad-happens-in-a-cabin-in-the-woods story (my favorite genre) starring the alluring redhead Rose Leslie, best known as Ygritte, the Wildling love interest of Kit Harington in ‘‘Game of Thrones.’’

That attracted the attention of the married producing team Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher, who tapped Janiak, raised Catholic and a former Ph.D. candidate in modern Jewish studies at the University of Chicago, to co-write and direct a remake of the cult horror movie ‘‘The Craft,’’ about witchcraft at a Catholic prep school.

She said she has no patience when she hears about female directors who melt into a puddle of tears after tangling with a grouchy cinematographer, saying: ‘‘I hear stories like that and think, If you are going to let people walk all over you, why do you even want to direct?’’

Fixing the gender problem in Hollywood is important for women like Janiak. But it’s also important for women and girls everywhere. ‘‘We are influencing culture, which is why it’s so dangerous, I think, not to have more women making movies,’’ she said. ‘‘Why can’t I direct ‘Superman’?’’",REAL
Running Away With the Circus,"It wasn’t that they were quite willing to agree with animal activists, who for years have argued that the circus’s elephant-training methods, which involve bullhooks and tasers, are draconian. Instead, the Felds were yielding to reality: More and more municipalities, places like Los Angeles and Oakland, have banned the use of these training devices, presenting a logistical nightmare. What do you do with the elephants after they’ve performed in Phoenix and the circus is heading to Los Angeles? You can’t keep them on the trains. You can’t have them idle in the backyard of the Staples Center.

The decision was devastating, but Kenneth was philosophical. ‘‘The circus has changed over the years,’’ he said. ‘‘There’s no other entertainment that’s been around for this long that you could name. We’re older than baseball. We’re older than Coca-Cola.’’ He continued: ‘‘I don’t know how many times it’s been reimagined, reinvented, but I know we’ve probably done it six, eight times. We’re going to do it again without the elephants in a whole different way. Then we’re going to do it again and we’re going to do it again and we’re going to do it again.’’

The circus is no longer the Felds’ most popular business. They’ve acquired many other live entertainment shows, like motor sports and “Disney Live!” But they see themselves as the stewards of an important legacy, and the circus remains the inspiration for everything they do. Now, though, the Felds don’t merely have to adapt to the changing times; they have to adapt to a time that is particularly inhospitable to the idea of a circus in the first place. In a culture of cheap, ubiquitous hand-held entertainment that doesn’t require arena parking, they have to convince the world that the circus still matters.

While the Felds are at work in meeting after meeting, trying to figure out how to create a circus so good that we won’t notice the absence of the elephants, the 65 elephant workers who train and look after the animals are getting ready to take what could be their final laps across the country. Some will move to Florida, because the elephants will need to be cared for by people who know what they’re doing.

‘‘The train is like a city on wheels,” said Stephanie Sinclair, who spent 11 days photographing the ‘‘blue unit’’ — one of two units, each a completely different show, that travel the country each year. Everyone on the train knows one another, but the various sets of performers don’t mingle much. They practice so often and so rigorously that when the train is in motion — the average distance between cities is 350 miles — they shut down: They sleep, they watch TV, they read. The train stops only to refill the water stock and, occasionally, for the animals to stretch out on longer trips; whenever it does stop, the performers immediately begin rehearsing again.

There are more than 300 people in the blue unit, representing 25 different countries and speaking everything from Russian to Arabic to Guarani. A few travel in cars and trailers, but a majority, 270, live on the trains. Only about 100 of them are actual performers; the rest are support staff like trainers, teachers, animal minders, carpenters. (One of the show’s publicists lives on the train, too.) Most come from multigeneration circus families, to the extent that collectively, the circus staff represents thousands of years of circus history. They spend 44 weeks of the year traveling an average of 20,000 miles from coast to coast on a train that is 61 cars — a full mile — long. In total, the train comprises four animal stock cars, 32 living coaches, two concession storage cars, 19 equipment cars, a generator car, a shop car, an auxiliary shop car and, of course, the pie car, which is the train’s diner, open whenever the train is moving.

The men and women of the circus all say that only circus people like them can understand the lifestyle. Adrielle, who rides a motorcycle in the Globe of Steel, is a fifth-generation circus performer from Brazil. Some of the Chinese acrobats have been doing trapeze work since they were 4. (They have their own chef, a condition of their contracts.) Milcidas Jimenez, who sells cotton candy, has been with the circus for 28 years. His 19-year-old daughter also sells food, and his wife does face-painting. His two little ones, who are 4 and 5, are in the nursery school.

The circus workers shared stories with Sinclair about their children being born on the road. Sandor Eke, who is the boss clown, almost missed the birth of his son, now 14 months. Sandor himself was born into the circus in Hungary. He says that his son will be ‘‘a dentist, a lawyer, a professional athlete, a millionaire.’’ But of course he’s joking; about his son, he said, ‘‘He’s already starting to juggle.’’ That’s what happens when you’re born into the circus.

Joey Frisco Jr. is the blue unit’s lead elephant trainer. He’s third-generation circus — his grandfather ran away to join it. Joey met his wife on the train: She was a dancer, but now that they have five children, she’s focused on them and the elephants; she rode one of the animals in a show I attended.

‘‘Who doesn’t want to retire to Florida?’’ Frisco said with a big smile during the preshow in New Orleans. We were talking about the elephants’ retirement, and his family’s move. His father would also work at the Florida preserve. When I suggested that this was maybe a happy decision, he said he was a circus person; all the elephant people are. You can rarely see an Asian elephant at the zoo anymore, and when you do, it’s far away. Now where would people be able to see the elephants? Now where would he get the joy of seeing people’s eyes light up when they were close enough to touch the beasts?

So you’re sad, I said to him. He looked down at the ground, and when he looked up, his smile was gone. ‘‘Everyone is sad,’’ he said.

It is an amazing thing to see someone fly through the air, but it’s harder to convey that fact to people who believe they are watching people fly through the air on-screen all the time. You can’t convince children who watch shows with talking animals that it is an incredible thing just to see an elephant play ball with another elephant, or to see a tiger simply not eat his trainer.

It’s getting harder to convince adults, too. Somehow, over the past few decades, we’ve forgotten how to be impressed by physical achievements, incredible feats that no normal person can do. We have forgotten how to prize an act in which a performer risks his life gracefully — to understand that it is both the risk and the grace that make it something truly astonishing. Nowadays, you go to Times Square, and you don’t see people juggling and eating fire and doing delightful busking; you see people in superhero and Elmo costumes doing nothing but existing off versions of something that appears in movies, on TVs and in toy stores. That’s the commercial reality that the Felds have diversified into via their other live shows, like Marvel Universe Live! and Disney on Ice.

The circus is the last bulwark against all that. Which is why the Felds are driven to demonstrate, once again, what is magical and singular about it. Maybe they don’t have their new light bulb yet, but they already have a lot to work with. At the circus, you can see Gemma be shot out of a cannon, which almost always makes children stop eating their popcorn and turn to their parents to ask if they really just saw what they think they saw. You can see clowns, the needy, needy clowns, who look you in the eye to make sure you registered every single strange thing that just happened — a dance, a pratfall, a misunderstanding with the other clowns. You can see ecstatic women drop from the ceiling in Plexiglas globes that just dangle there, and Paulo, who descends on a rope, only to ascend back up with a jetpack. You can watch a league of Chinese men in unitards juggle fire, and a group of women dressed in gold minidresses who ride golden bicycles in artful formation. You can see all these breathtaking feats that — even in a culture that’s all about constant distraction these days — are hard to look away from.

And here’s something else I saw: After the trapeze act was over at a show in Newark, a 10-year-old girl next to me began to sob. When her parents asked her why she was crying, she looked up and shook her head hopelessly and said she couldn’t say.",REAL
The Doomsday Scam,"Abu Omar understood the implications. The Islamic State was seeking a weapon that could do more than strike fear in its enemies. It sought a weapon that could kill its enemies wholesale, instantly changing the character of the war. Imagine a mushroom cloud rising over the fronts of Syria and Iraq. Imagine the jihadists’ foes scattered and ruined, the caliphate expanding and secure.

Imagine the price the Islamic State would pay.

Abu Omar thought he might have a lead. He had a cousin in Syria who told him about red mercury that other jihadists had seized from a corrupt rebel group. Maybe he could arrange a sale. And so soon Abu Omar set out, off for the front lines outside Latakia, a Syrian government stronghold, in pursuit of the gullible man’s shortcut to a nuclear bomb.

To approach the subject of red mercury is to journey into a comic-book universe, a zone where the stubborn facts of science give way to unverifiable claims, fantasy and outright magic, and where villains pursuing the dark promise of a mysterious weapon could be rushing headlong to the end of the world. This is all the more remarkable given the broad agreement among nonproliferation specialists that red mercury, at least as a chemical compound with explosive pop, does not exist.

Legends of red mercury’s powers began circulating by late in the Cold War. But their breakout period came after the Soviet Union’s demise, when disarray and penury settled over the Kremlin’s arms programs. As declining security fueled worries of illicit trafficking, red mercury embedded itself in the lexicon of the freewheeling black-market arms bazaar. Aided by credulous news reports, it became an arms trafficker’s marvelous elixir, a substance that could do almost anything a shady client might need: guide missiles, shield objects from radar, equip a rogue underdog state or terrorist group with weapons rivaling those of a superpower. It was priced accordingly, at hundreds of thousands of dollars a kilogram. With time, the asking price would soar.

As often happens with durable urban legends, the red-mercury meme found just enough public support to assure an unextinguishable life. Chief among its proponents was Samuel T. Cohen, the American physicist and Manhattan Project veteran often called the father of the neutron bomb, who before his death in 2010 spoke vividly of the perils of nuclear terrorism and what he said was poor government preparation for such attacks. Cohen joined the red-mercury bandwagon as it gathered momentum in the early 1990s, staking a lonely position by asserting that the substance could be used to build nuclear weapons of exceptionally small size.

In one edition of his autobiography, he claimed red mercury was manufactured by ‘‘mixing special nuclear materials in very small amounts into the ordinary compound and then inserting the mixture into a nuclear reactor or bombarding it with a particle-accelerator beam.’’ The result, he said, ‘‘is a remarkable nonexploding high explosive’’ that, when detonated, becomes ‘‘extremely hot, which allows pressures and temperatures to be built up that are capable of igniting the heavy hydrogen and producing a pure-fusion mini neutron bomb.’’ Here was a proliferation threat of an order never before seen.

The establishment largely dismissed him. ‘‘If he did ever reveal evidence, I never saw it,’’ said Peter D. Zimmerman, a nuclear physicist who served as chief scientific adviser for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency at the time. He added, ‘‘I would have seen it, at that point in history.’’ Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation analyst at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif., put matters less delicately, saying Cohen followed a classic formula for conspiracy theories, mixing ‘‘nonscientific mumbo jumbo’’ with allegations that governments were withholding the truth. ‘‘I could never figure out where Sam Cohen the physicist ended and Sam Cohen the polemicist began,’’ he said.

Russian news organizations in the 1990s nevertheless relayed claims of red mercury’s destructive potential at face value, and foreign news outlets occasionally repeated them, boosting the material’s credibility and mystique. Britain’s Channel 4 elevated the material’s profile with two documentaries — ‘‘Trail of Red Mercury’’ and ‘‘Pocket Neutron’’ — that presented, according to their producers, ‘‘startling evidence that Russian scientists have designed a miniature neutron bomb using a mysterious compound called red mercury.’’ Cohen held a news conference after one broadcast to say it confirmed his fears.

Outside this circle of the faithful, red mercury faced doubters. The substance was almost everything but scientifically verifiable. It was not even reasonably explicable. ‘‘Over all it doesn’t make much sense,’’ an engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory wrote to a supervisor in 1994. It was also devilishly elusive, turning up in tales of smuggling mafias but never quite finding its way to a law-enforcement body or nuclear agency for proper frisking. When hopeful sellers were caught, substance in hand, it reliably turned out to be something else, sometimes a placebo of chuckle-worthy simplicity: ordinary mercury mixed with dye. The shadowy weaponeer’s little helper, it was the unobtainium of the post-Soviet world.

Among specialists who investigated the claims, the doubts hardened to an unequivocal verdict: Red mercury was a lure, the central prop of a confidence game designed to fleece ignorant buyers. ‘‘Take a bogus material, give it an enigmatic name, exaggerate its physical properties and intended uses, mix in some human greed and intrigue, and voilà: one half-baked scam,’’ the Department of Energy’s Critical Technologies Newsletter declared. In 1998, 15 authors from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which helps maintain the American nuclear-weapons stockpile, published an article in The Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry that called red mercury ‘‘a relatively notorious nuclear hoax.’’ In 1999, Jane’s Intelligence Review suggested that the scam’s victims may have included Osama bin Laden, whose Qaeda purchasing agents were ‘‘nuclear novices.’’ The most accommodating theory held that red mercury might have been a Soviet code name for something else — maybe lithium-6, a controlled material with an actual use in nuclear weapons — and traffickers repurposed the label for whatever nuclear detritus they were trying to move.

A true believer of the legends might interject that official skepticism in public did not preclude another discussion playing out on classified channels. But when WikiLeaks published American diplomatic cables in 2010 and 2011, snippets of the internal red-mercury dialogue were consistent with the public statements. In 2006, according to one cable, Sri Lanka notified the American Embassy in Colombo of concerns that the Tamil Tigers, a secessionist militant group, had tried to procure the substance. ‘‘Red Mercury is a well-known scam material,’’ a State Department nonproliferation official told the embassy. ‘‘There is nothing to be concerned about.’’

Few people are more familiar with the lingering red-mercury assertions than Zimmerman, who later became director of the Center for Science and Security Studies at King’s College in London. For years, he canvassed his peers in nuclear-weapons and nonproliferation communities. He asked about the substance in conferences. He brought it up in one-on-one sessions with weaponeers from multiple countries and scientists from the former Communist bloc. He concluded that the substance was not just ‘‘hot air, myth, smoke and mirrors’’ but also ‘‘a con job.’’

When I called him, he laughed and referred to people convinced of its powers as ‘‘Red Mercurians.’’ Some of the stories he’d heard, he said, resembled ‘‘an old Jack Benny routine.’’ He paused to be straightforward and clear. Red mercury (or, for that matter, any mercury compound of any color), he said, had no nuclear-weapons application of any sort. The particulars of its supposed martial utility do not square with basic science. ‘‘It cannot be true,’’ he said, and spoke as if restating a longstanding challenge. ‘‘I have plenty of times staked my reputation on these statements, and no one has ever called me on it.’’

And yet a generation after the hype first burned bright, shopworn legends of red mercury’s powers, lodged in fringe provinces of the popular imagination, continue to surface, rekindled by shifting casts of jihadists, tomb looters, smugglers, journalists, YouTube salesmen and other wannabe profiteers. One thing about red mercury: If it’s not nuclear, it’s viral.

Abu Omar had joined a long line of players. It was impossible not to wonder: Did he really believe in red mercury himself?

When the Crocodile placed his order, Abu Omar said, the smuggler asked how much the Islamic State was willing to pay. The answer was vague. The Islamic State would pay, he said, ‘‘whatever was asked.’’ This was not the practical guidance a businessman needs. So the Crocodile sharpened the answer. Up to $4 million — and a $100,000 bonus — for each unit of red mercury matching that shown in a set of photographs he sent to Abu Omar over WhatsApp, the mobile-messaging service.

The images showed a pale, oblong object, roughly the length of a hot-dog bun, with a hole at each end. It bore no similarity to the red mercury that smugglers often described — a thick liquid with a brilliant metallic sheen. It appeared to be a dull piece of injection-molded plastic, like a swim-lane buoy or a children’s toy. But it had an intriguing resemblance that hinted at how the Islamic State’s interest might have been piqued: It was the exact likeness of an object that in 2013 the Cihan News Agency, one of Turkey’s largest news agencies, had called a red-mercury rocket warhead.

In that case, three men were said to have been arrested near Kayseri, a city in central Turkey. Cihan’s coverage followed the familiar arc of red-mercury hype. Footage shot at night showed officials in protective suits and masks approaching a van. The news presenter reported the operation in matter-of-fact tones, noting that the seized rocket component ‘‘was examined by six different institutions, including the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority, all of which found that it contained the material red mercury. The liquid can cause large explosions and is worth $1 million per liter. Red mercury is used for intercontinental rocket systems and hydrogen bombs.’’

With that validation, the photographs traveled on social media, finding their way to the Islamic State and then to Abu Omar, who said he remembered something he had heard from his cousin in Syria, a fighter for Jabhat al-Nusra, the Qaeda affiliate and bitter Islamic State rival. This cousin, he said, had told him that Nusra fighters had taken red-mercury warheads from a now-defunct rebel group, Ghuraba al-Sham, which the jihadists had overpowered in 2013, executing its leaders. The warheads that the Nusra fighters confiscated, Abu Omar said, matched those in the Crocodile’s photographs.

Not long after leaving Tal Abyad, Abu Omar said, he tracked down his cousin near the front lines outside Latakia to arrange a sale. The plan quickly tanked. His cousin, he said, suspected Abu Omar was shopping for the Islamic State. He refused to discuss terms. ‘‘I want you to end this talk about red mercury because I know where it is going to go,’’ Abu Omar recalled his cousin saying. ‘‘I know ISIS wants them. But we will never sell.’’

Abu Omar was describing all this in the lobby of a Turkish hotel, where he appeared one night this fall after several phone calls and chat sessions. His stories were more than far-fetched; they were confounding. Anyone with an Internet connection could quickly discover that the red-mercury meme was widely regarded as nonsense. Even a visit to Wikipedia — whose entry on the subject began, ‘‘Red mercury is a hoax substance of uncertain composition’’ — would surely be enough to raise questions for anyone disbursing Islamic State cash. I told Abu Omar that I had spoken with several nonproliferation experts, and they roundly agreed: Red mercury was a scam. Did he believe otherwise?

Abu Omar listened patiently. His face gave nothing away. Then he replied politely, as if addressing the uninformed. ‘‘I have seen it with my own eyes,’’ he said.

Two years before in Ras al-Ain, another Syrian border town, Abu Omar said, he was with a group of Islamic fighters that organized a test with 3.5 grams of liquid red mercury and a container of chlorine. The experiment was led by Abu Suleiman al-Kurdi, who commanded a small fighting group that has since joined the Islamic State. Al-Kurdi gathered the jihadists around his materials as the test began. ‘‘I will count to 10, and whoever stays in the room after that suffocates and dies,’’ he warned.

The chlorine was held in a foil-lined container, Abu Omar said. As the group watched, al-Kurdi dipped a needle into the red mercury and then touched the needle to the chlorine, transferring a drop. ‘‘Everything interacted with everything,’’ Abu Omar said, and a foul vapor rose. All of the fighters were driven away, first from the room, then from the house.

The powers of red mercury, Abu Omar said, were real.

Almost every aspect of this story, like so many other breathless accounts of red mercury, was unverifiable. And even if something did happen in that room, the noxious vapors could have a simple explanation: Chlorine alone damages the respiratory tract and can be deadly if inhaled.

But Abu Omar had answered the question. He stood firmly in the red-mercury camp. He was hardly alone.

Safi al-Safi, an unaffiliated rebel and small-time smuggler specializing in weapons, antiquities and forged documents, sat in an open-air cafe beside the Syrian-Turkish border. He was smoking scented tobacco from a water pipe while discussing the cross-border mercury trade. ‘‘Red mercury has a red color, and there is mercury that has the color of dark blood,’’ he said. ‘‘And there is green mercury, which is used for sexual enhancement, and silver mercury is used for medical purposes. The most expensive type is called Blood of the Slaves, which is the darkest type. Magicians use it to summon jinni.’’

This primer — passionate, thorough, outlandish to its core — fits a type. In meetings with smugglers in several towns along the border, red mercury inhabited the fertile mental terrain where fear and distrust of authority meet superstitious folklore. Descriptions of the material varied slightly in detail and sharply in price, and there were ample contradictions. But there was a remarkable consistency in several intricate legends and origin stories, even among people who did not know one another and who were separated by many miles.

Another smuggler, Faysal, who said he was awaiting results of vetting by the United States government to join a Pentagon-backed force opposing the Islamic State (the program has since been dropped), continued the lesson. ‘‘It has two different types: hot and cold,’’ he said. The cold form, which other smugglers sometimes call ‘‘spiritual mercury,’’ he said, ‘‘can be found in Roman graveyards.’’ He added: ‘‘Kings and princes and sultans used to take it to the graves with them.’’

This type of red mercury, the smugglers said, has been recovered by Middle Eastern grave robbers for at least several decades. ‘‘In previous generations, old women wore it in a necklace to keep the devil’s eye away,’’ Faysal said. More recently, rich men shopped for cold red mercury as either an aphrodisiac or to improve their sexual performance.

The substance was so valuable that dishonest traders, al-Safi said, often trafficked in fake red mercury. ‘‘In my village at least 15 people trade in it,’’ he said. ‘‘They buy normal mercury, and they color it. They use red lipstick and put a little on a spoon and heat the spoon until it turns to powder, and you put the powder in the mercury, and you mix it, and it becomes that color. This is how you cheat it.’’

Identifying such cheats was easy, the smugglers said, because real red mercury is attracted to gold but repelled by garlic. Wise buyers bring gold and garlic to test the product before cash changes hands. ‘‘You put a drop on a plate and you approach it with garlic, and that drop is going to move away,’’ a third smuggler, Abu Zaid explained. ‘‘But if you put red mercury on a plate and move a piece of gold under the plate, the red mercury is going to move with it.’’

Cold red mercury, these smugglers said, could not be used for nuclear weapons; that was the role of hot red mercury, which had a more recent origin. Only sophisticated laboratories manufactured it, and the hot red mercury available in Syria had come from the Soviet Union — usually, according to Raed, another smuggler, ‘‘in a specially maintained box with equipment and a manual and special gloves.’’

Abu Zaid said hot red mercury was sometimes offered for sale in Syria and could be useful for the Islamic State, which has a cadre of former Iraqi officials who would know how to harness its power. But he cautioned that buyers could easily make a grievous mistake. ‘‘It is not only about getting the red mercury,’’ he said. ‘‘The very small box needs special equipment to open it, and special reactors to work with it. If you open this box, a radius of eight kilometers around you will be destroyed.’’

This was especially dangerous, because hot red mercury could also be harvested from junkyards and seamstress shops. Al-Safi described how this came to pass. To prevent the weapons-grade material from falling into the wrong hands during what he called ‘‘the American occupation’’ of the former Soviet Union, he said, Russians safeguarding the stock late in the Cold War cached tiny reservoirs of red mercury in sewing machines and radios bound for export, which were then scattered throughout the Arab world. (Another version of the same tale says that red mercury is hidden in old television sets.)

These rumors have been circulating for years, once driving prices for old sewing machines as high as $50,000 in Saudi Arabia, according to a 2009 Reuters report. Often the most-sought-after machines were the Singer brand — which, considering that Singer was an American manufacturer, did not quite align with the Soviet fable. No matter. Abu Omar also insisted that old sewing machines were a red-mercury source. ‘‘Specific machines,’’ he said, ‘‘with a butterfly logo on them.’’ He said he knew this from experience because the red mercury used in the jihadists’ chlorine experiment in Ras al-Ain had come from his grandmother’s machine.

If all of this seems like a bad and ever-expanding joke, it can work that way. When I mentioned the garlic-and-gold tests and red mercury’s supposed qualities as a sexual stimulant to Peter Zimmerman, the nuclear physicist, his answer came quickly. ‘‘Take that with a grain of red mercury,’’ he said.

Jokes may be as useful a means as any of understanding red mercury, considering another origin theory that has made the rounds for years: that the hoax has roots in an intelligence-service put-on, a disinformation campaign of phony news articles planted decades ago in Russian newspapers by the K.G.B. and one of its successors, the F.S.B.

There are other variants of this story, including one in which Washington and Moscow collaborated in circulating red-mercury stories to flush out nuclear smugglers and to waste terrorists’ time. American soldiers and officers in bomb-disposal and counter-W.M.D. jobs shared that version with me, although, once again, no one had evidence for its veracity. It was something that they had heard on their jobs and a story they admitted that they liked — the thinking being that if the Four Lions wanted to shop for photon torpedoes, let them shop; that would be preferable to how the Islamic State otherwise spends its time. (Abu Omar, for example, said the Islamic State had also sought his help in abducting Western journalists.)

And yet the U.S. military and its allies, too, had found themselves expending resources on the hoax. In early 2011, a European military unit in Afghanistan handed over supposed red mercury to their American colleagues at Task Force Paladin, the command charged with countering and analyzing improvised bombs. The handoff triggered an international counterproliferation response, according to several American soldiers familiar with the events and an officer who participated in the operation but requested anonymity because parts of it remain classified.

Task Force Paladin alerted the 20th Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosives Command, the primary U.S. Army unit trained to eliminate threats of W.M.D., that they had an unknown substance that could be dangerous material. Back at the command’s headquarters in Maryland, teams of specialists in nuclear disablement and chemical response were packed into a C-5 military-transport jet and rushed to Bagram Air Base, where they were shown two small, lead-lined containers. One was about the dimensions of a quart-size Mason jar; the other roughly the size of a pint glass.

The nuclear-disablement team went first but found no sign that the containers held anything radioactive. They then passed the job to the chemical-warfare specialists and bomb-disposal techs. External tests on the containers were inconclusive, the officer involved said, so the soldiers took up the unenviable task of breaching the vessels to find out what exactly was inside. Wearing protective suits and breathing apparatuses, they put the first lead-lined container inside an airtight glove box within what the officer called a ‘‘secure, reinforced’’ shipping container, and then monitored it from afar by video as the spinning bit from a remote-controlled power drill plunged through the container’s soft wall. Out spilled ordinary mercury, the old standby of red-mercury scams. The second container was empty. In all, the officer said, the mercury amounted to ‘‘about a quarter or half cup.’’

The American soldiers quietly packed up and flew home. Their mission is memorialized in the Army’s classified records with a title — Operation Chimera — that members of the American bomb-disposal community said suggested a certain sense of humor about the whole affair. How the Europeans had been deceived is not publicly known. (One American familiar with the events said a European special-forces team had been lured into a bad buy.) On that matter, the American military declined to comment.

This was hardly the worst of the hoax’s real-world effects. In southern Africa, it has cost lives. According to a regional and especially cruel variation of the legend, the substance is found in conventional military munitions, particularly land mines, there to be claimed by anyone daring enough to take them apart and extract the goods. Tom Dibb, the program manager in Zimbabwe for the Halo Trust, a private mine-clearing organization, said he and the local authorities have documented people being killed in explosions while hunched over land mines or mortar bombs with hand tools.

In the bloodiest incident, in 2013, six people were killed near Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital, by a blast in the home of a faith healer. One victim was an infant. Dibb spoke with the police and said ‘‘they were pretty convinced that it was a tank mine being taken apart for red mercury.’’ In another case, which Dibb examined himself, two men were killed and another wounded as they tried harvesting land mines for red-mercury extraction from a minefield. The most recent death that the Halo Trust investigated occurred on Nov. 1, Dibb said, when a 22-year-old man, Godknows Katchekwama, was killed while trying to dismantle and remove red mercury from an R2M2, a South African antipersonnel land mine about the size of a tuna can.

The explosion outside Harare prompted Michael P. Moore, who manages the Landmines in Africa website, to start a second site, the Campaign Against Red Mercury, which documents hoaxes and urges people not to believe them. Moore said he tried tracing how the meme leapt from sewing machines to explosive devices but could not figure it out. Public-education campaigns were needed, he said, because ‘‘it’s enough of a pervasive myth that it’s not going to go away anytime soon. And people are dying.’’

The Crocodile kept inquiring about red mercury for more than a year, Abu Omar said, pressing for results. He reached out one last time on WhatsApp in June 2015. At the time, Kurds were attacking the Islamic State in Tal Abyad, and the commander also sought what he called ‘‘thermal panels’’ to deceive the weapons-guidance systems on American warplanes. But by November of this year, Abu Omar was still empty-handed. By then Tal Abyad had fallen to the Kurds, and the Crocodile had gone silent, leaving the quest without a sponsor for now.

Abu Omar had kept busy with other work; he said he had recently delivered 23 commercial drones to the jihadists. He remained a storehouse of red-mercury yarns. Word was that the Kurdish fighting groups opposing the Islamic State had been buying up the stuff. ‘‘People I know sold it to Kurds three times,’’ he said. And eight red-mercury warheads had been found in the Aleppo countryside, too. The story was similar to one from Reyhanli, another Turkish border city, where smugglers insisted that rebels in Idlib had overrun a military checkpoint and captured a few grams of red mercury. This material was said to be available for sale, although no one who said this could arrange to see it. It led to an obvious question: If Syria’s military possessed red-mercury weapons, why hadn’t it used them? Why would an imperiled force with a well-documented disregard for restraint forgo uncorking such a weapon as its garrisons fell?

If red mercury seemed a perfect fit for the particular nature of this brutal, shadowy war — an apocalyptic weapon for a terrorist group driven in part by the belief that we are approaching the return of the Mahdi, the final defeat of infidels and the end of the world — it was not making itself easy to get. All this, and the police were drawing near. In June, Turkish news agencies reported another red-mercury bust, this time of a pair of Georgians. And Abu Omar said an associate of his had managed to obtain the material, only to be arrested in Ankara before he could unload it. The authorities released him but kept his red mercury, he said, for themselves. ‘‘His phone was monitored,’’ Abu Omar said, and thus the bad turn.

None of this was verifiable, either. The Turkish government declined to answer questions about its red-mercury arrests over the last two years. And his friend? Abu Omar said he had fled to Sweden. He provided a link to the man’s Facebook profile, but the man was not replying to requests. You can’t be too careful in the red-mercury game.",REAL
"Letter of Recommendation: Christopher Logue, ‘War Music’","Photo

As an illiterate — which is how Thoreau, one of our supposed avatars of democratic life, saw those of us who have neither Greek nor Latin — I realize that it’s an act of public self-shaming to vouch for a favorite translation of Homer. But it’s even worse than that for me, given I know very little about English translations of the ‘‘Iliad.’’ There are at least 100 of them, and to boast, as I will now, that I’ve read seven, maybe eight, is — at least to the ‘‘literate’’ set — a little like bragging that I’m the shortest guy on the Brooklyn Nets, and, hey, did I mention I can’t dunk?

My lack of fitness established, I can offer you nothing more than my unreasonable love — constant as it is uncomplicated — as endorsement of Christopher Logue’s version of the ‘‘Iliad,’’ ‘‘War Music.’’ (The final, most complete version will appear in January.) That an illiterate like myself could love it so fully may have to do with the fact that Logue (1926-2011), a British poet, actor and screenwriter, was illiterate, too. Logue didn’t even graduate from high school, enlisting in the British Army at 17, in 1944. An injury in training left him blind in one eye after an Army surgeon botched the repair. Not long after that, Logue was caught stealing military property and sentenced to two years in prison.

If Logue’s early life, as told in his wonderful, gossipy memoir, ‘‘Prince Charming,’’ suggests a man not bound for greatness — much less goodness — it also documents a young man committed to poetry. His first book, ‘‘Wand and Quadrant,’’ published in 1953, earned Logue only a handful of readers — mostly English tourists to whom he peddled it on Paris streets — but it also got him two important responses. One is probably the coolest blurb in the history of literature: ‘‘Not bad,’’ Ezra Pound wrote. ‘‘I can read quite a bit of it.’’ The other was from a producer at BBC Radio, Donald Carne-Ross, who asked him to record a few of his poems for broadcast. Afterward, he approached Logue about putting together a radio version of the ‘‘Iliad,’’ in all new translations. The young poet wanted no part of it, and not because he knew no Greek.

‘‘I find it boring,’’ Logue said to a friend, Doris Lessing, about Homer’s epic, echoing a feeling that I — and perhaps you, too — have had upon trying to read any of the translations we’ve endured in school: I’m looking at you, Richmond Lattimore!

Logue is also known for the anachronisms in his translations. See if you can spot one below: That unpremeditated joy as you/ — the Uzi shuddering warm against your hip/Happy in danger in a dangerous place/Yourself another self you found at Troy — /Squeeze nickel through that rush of Greekoid scum!

‘‘Professor Lattimore adheres to the literal at times as stubbornly as a mule eating briars,’’ wrote the Thoreauvianly literate American critic Guy Davenport in his great ‘‘The Geography of the Imagination.’’ Lattimore’s literality — English words arranged in Greek syntax — produces a language that is barely English, let alone representative of Homer’s poetry. ‘‘One can say in this language,’’ Davenport explains, quoting Lattimore, ‘‘such things as ‘slept in that place in an exhaustion of sleep’ (for Homer’s ‘aching with fatigue and weary for lack of sleep’) and ‘the shining clothes are lying away uncared for’ (for ‘your laundry is tossed in a heap waiting to be washed’).’’

Carne-Ross, who was commissioning his new ‘‘Iliad’’ to evade translatorese, wouldn’t accept Logue’s demurral. He, too, found many translations of Homer — Lattimore’s especially — boring and had the Greek to back it up. He also had a plan for how Logue could manage the impossible task of translating a language he did not know. ‘‘I will make you a crib,’’ Carne-Ross told Logue. A crib: a word-for-word translation of the Greek for Logue to work from. Carne-Ross also read the Greek aloud to Logue, to give him a sense of how it felt. Logue quickly discovered that there was nothing boring about Homer, only the risk of translating Homer into something boring.",REAL
Making Bathrooms More ‘Accommodating’,"Photo

The clearest visual markers of sex difference many of us see in the course of the day are the signs on public bathroom entrances: MEN on one door, WOMEN on the other. Restrooms are public conveniences, freely available in most places and in principle open to all, but the terms for entering them have been fixed. They’re fundamentally fraught spaces, where we undress and obey the dictates of our bodies and therefore feel vulnerable. If people think you’ve confused male and female and walked through the wrong door, you risk discomfort, or even real trouble. This can lead to the spectacle of women standing in line for what feels like forever while the men’s room is empty. Now transgender people, most prominently, are asking society to rethink all of this, from signs to design to who gets to enter where.

Many people viscerally resist the idea of mixing male and female anatomy in multistall bathrooms and locker rooms. In Houston earlier this month, voters rejected a broad equal rights ordinance that protected against discrimination in housing and employment, as well as public spaces, on the basis of several categories, including age and race along with sexual orientation and gender identity. Opponents focused their campaign narrowly, nicknaming the law the ‘‘bathroom ordinance.’’ They created ‘‘No Men in Women’s Bathrooms’’ T-shirts and a TV ad with sinister images of a man threatening a girl in the stalls, successfully playing on voters’ fears.

School districts throughout the country have generally agreed to call transgender students by their preferred names and pronouns, and allowed them to join the sports teams of the gender with which they identify. But deciding where they should change and shower and use the bathroom has been trickier.

In suburban Illinois, a transgender high-school student who is undergoing hormone therapy and has a passport identifying her as female asked to change in the girls’ locker room. The district refused, saying that ‘‘privacy concerns’’ required sending her to a separate room down the hall. She and her family brought a civil rights complaint, and the United States Department of Education intervened earlier this month, asking the district to give her the right to shower and change in the same locker room with her female peers. A privacy curtain could address both her needs and other students’ concerns, the Education Department said — as long as other girls are also allowed to change behind the curtain, if they choose.

A word that comes up frequently in discussions about access to bathrooms is ‘‘accommodate,’’ and it is a telling one. ‘‘Accommodate’’ comes from the Latin for ‘‘to make fitting.’’ It means to adapt, to bring into agreement or harmony, to furnish with something desired or needed, to favor or oblige. It can be a word of welcome and hospitality coming from a concierge or maître d’. But it can also have a compulsory aspect — it’s a word that involves moving over to make room for other people, whether you want to or not. In the 1960s, Congress gave religious people a right to reasonable accommodation at work, like a place to pray, or time off on the Sabbath, or permission to wear a turban or kipa or hijab. In 1990, the Americans With Disabilities Act afforded a similar right to people who had been shut out by doors they could not open and stairs they could not climb. For them, fighting for accommodation in bathrooms was central. If you can’t get into one and use it, you can’t work in a building or go to a concert.

Activists for all manner of marginalized groups have chafed at the word ‘‘accommodation.’’ It often sets up a distinction between the normal and the other. One group’s needs determine a basic shape, and then another group comes along and asks to alter the contours. But the word also allows for the possibility of mu­tual give and take. ‘‘It implies a two-way street,’’ says Mara Keisling, co-founder and director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. ‘‘Having a civil society is all about accommodation. Any relationship demands that.’’ She thinks transgender people have been doing all the accommodating when it comes to the bathroom. But for a lot of people, the transgender bid to reconsider norms — the vocabulary, a girl who has a penis — has burst into the public consciousness quickly, and seems bewildering.",REAL
Don Lemon Doesn’t Get Offended,"The latest controversy was over your comments on the police-brutality video from Spring Valley High School in South Carolina. You said you wanted to see more context. Did you see the whole segment?

No. I watched a clip online. If you look at the segment, I said it was horrible and that there does not seem to be any justification for what the police officer is doing. I said that I wanted more information. I want to know about his history, I want to know what precipitated it, I want to know what the school is like, I want to know if he’s done it before. That’s what a journalist does.

What would you do if you had total editorial freedom? I would like to have a judgment-free-zone place where we can go — all of us — and we can all talk. When I was at L.S.U., there was a place called Free Speech Alley the students could go and say whatever they wanted. There were Klan people, there were Black Panthers.

You’ve said that liberals are actually intolerant. What do you mean by that? If you don’t make room for the possibility that you can be intolerant, then there is a fairly good chance that you are.

Can you think of a time that you’ve been offended or hurt and then learned from it? Nothing I can think of specifically, no.

It doesn’t seem to me that you get offended very much. I don’t. Instead of being offended or defensive or whatever, I try to be curious about why that person feels that way, why someone has that particular opinion. I understand people being offended and hurt, but as a journalist, I gotta move beyond that. I can’t do that.

"Saving the World, Startup-Style","Photo

In 2010, not long after the earthquake hit Haiti, I was about an hour north of Port-au-Prince, standing under a mango tree. Its owner, a woman named Jelen, was telling me that she had two daughters but could afford to send only one to school. She knew this meant the other would be poor, like her, for the rest of her life. She said she was choosing the younger one because she was smarter. She then pointed at her mango tree. It was huge, bigger than a family home, and grew hundreds of mangoes each year. She knew that those mangoes could sell for several dollars each in America, but there was no easy way to get them there. So she sold most of them down the road at a local market for pennies. If she could find a good way to get those mangoes down the highway to the capital and then on a ship to America, she was confident that she could make enough money to send both her girls to school.

I remember feeling almost giddy as she told me this story. Jelen was about to get her wish. I knew that the American government, working with one of Haiti’s leading mango exporters, was funding a project to help everyday Haitians like her ship their mangoes to America.

Five years later, farmers like Jelen are still waiting. I hadn’t heard wrong: The United States Agency for International Development (U.S.A.I.D.) did indeed promise to fund such an effort. The idea was part of its mission to improve the supply chain of poor farmers by helping them prepare their food for sale long distances away. But just before sheds and a well were constructed, someone in Washington shifted U.S.A.I.D.’s primary goals in Haiti, and the project was canceled.

The story of Jelen and her mangoes is the story of the failure of American and world aid to help poor people in other countries. The United States government spends about $30 billion a year toward this end, while the rest of the world’s governments spend an additional $100 billion combined. Since World War II, that adds up to trillions spent on foreign aid. But global development agencies, like U.S.A.I.D. and the World Bank, have had trouble figuring out whether the money they spend actually makes poor people better off. For decades, grand theories were developed in rich countries about how to alleviate poverty, and huge amounts of money were spent, with stunningly little regard for their actual impact. There was the big-push model, the dual-sector model, the critical minimum effort, the Fei-Ranis surplus-labor model, capital accumulation, capacity building and, widely adopted and then thoroughly repudiated, the Washington Consensus. Each theory promised an elegant, compelling solution to world poverty. Each has fallen short, in many cases making poor people worse off.

During the past decade, there has been a quiet revolution in the way many scholars and advocates think about aid. We can call it the post-theory approach. The idea is that rich countries shouldn’t see themselves as responsible for coming up with theories about how poor countries can become richer. Rather, the rich countries allow the poor ones to determine what they think needs to happen — more girls in school, more vaccination, better access to global markets for farmers — and then pay money to whoever comes up with an actual solution. There are many versions of this approach. Under one idea, cash-on-delivery aid, donors would set aside some amount and then pay, say, $10 for every child who gets a vaccine shot. Governments, nonprofits and private-sector companies can compete on who can do this best. Development-impact bonds are another new idea. Private investors put their money at risk to achieve certain outcomes, like a lower H.I.V.-infection rate or cleaner water, and are paid back only if the projects they fund actually achieve their goals. The idea is that government money is spent only when an outcome is achieved, improving lives for the poor while saving taxpayers wasted expenses.",REAL
"Small Country, Many Tastes","Photo

Everyone just wanted to talk about the guinea pigs: Yes, they were cute. Yes, they come roasted. Yes, they were delicious, and if you couldn’t get into them, were you sure you’d come to the right message board? My first brush with Ecuadorean food on the Internet made it sound fairly single-minded. This was circa 2000, and I confess that I never learned much more after that, as a cuisine seemingly built on guinea pig seemed a little too bony for me.

‘‘Guinea pig is a very indigenous food, typically eaten in the mountains,’’ Arsenio Garcia told me recently, when I asked him about the one Ecuadorean dish I knew of. ‘‘I heard there’s a place in Queens that serves it. But it has to be very fresh,’’ he continued, in a tone that suggested that Queens is far enough away from Ecuador that we shouldn’t try. An industrial designer and enthusiastic home cook who grew up on the Ecuadorean coast, Garcia was more excited to talk about what else his homeland offers, the dishes that are less likely to be the subject of dares and bets: things like the very-fun-to-say llapingachos, meat- or cheese-stuffed potato patties, or cazuela, seafood baked under a thick blanket of plantain purée.

‘‘It’s a small country, but it’s very diverse,’’ Garcia said as we settled in at an Ecuadorean restaurant for juices made from naranjilla, a fruit that looks like an orange geode and tastes like passion fruit that got extra friendly with grape bubble gum. It’s a flavor I’d never imagined, let alone encountered, and Garcia smiled when I said so. He talked about Ecuador’s incredible variety of flora and fauna, owing to a geography that ranges from the warm Pacific to the freeze-drying heights of the Andes to the soup-hot Amazon basin within just a couple of hundred miles.

We continued the conversation back in his kitchen, where he prepared pescado encocado, fish simmered in a tomato-tinged coconut sauce. ‘‘This is a recipe from the coastal region of Esmeraldas,’’ he said. I noted that it seemed a lot like a dish called moqueca popular in Bahia, on the Brazilian Atlantic, literally at the other end of South America, where the cooking is a rich blend of African traditions mixed with native and Creole influences. ‘‘Ah,’’ Garcia said, ‘‘maybe that’s because Esmeraldas is home of the Afro-Ecuadoreans. But in the mountains, we have more pure indigenous people and mestizos. A lot of Lebanese came in the late 1800s, and Chinese in the last century. My mother’s mother is a redhead. I told you it’s incredibly diverse!’’

Garcia wanted me to leave with recipes from different corners of his homeland. We whirred up a quick sauce from his mother’s Andean hometown called ají Cuencano, a vinaigrettelike blend of chiles, lime, onion, cilantro, oil and tomate de árbol — another passion-fruit love child, this one with the savory depth of tomatoes. We made a quick stew of tomatoes, onions and tuna, stuffing that into cakes of plantain and peanut. Once crisped in oil, they were corviches, a specialty of Garcia’s coastal home region, Manabí, and they are delicious: Spots and spikes of crunch; the slight starchy sweetness of plantain; the buttery peanuts rounding it out before coming to the tender crispness of onion, the slipping flakiness of tuna. You normally wouldn’t serve the corviches and aji Cuencano together, because they are from different landscapes, but Garcia does, to help show a bigger picture of Ecuadorean food.

As we cooked in his home full of beautiful objects — that set of Oxo measuring spoons you probably have? He designed them — I wondered if his designer’s mind is what makes him so interested in the food of his homeland. If a mind that plucks objects out of the ether is constantly seeking grounding in memories, time or place. And then I remembered what Garcia also mentioned when I first asked him about guinea pigs. ‘‘I heard some people will bring back frozen ones in their luggage,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s a way of keeping connection with your land. So if I cook something from Ecuador and share it, it’s like sharing a part of the country.’’ For some that connection is found in particular tastes. For others, it may be finding the ways history ties together different landscapes and cultures into a cuisine.

Can My Workplace Ask Me for a Donation?,"My wife and I hired a nanny — I’ll call her Abby — to care for our infant for a period of a few months. She seemed very competent, and we liked her a lot, both personally and professionally. One evening we got a call from her boyfriend, saying that she was seriously ill, had been hospitalized and would be returning to her home state immediately. Of course we were very concerned for her, but we didn’t press for any more details at the time; we just asked him to call us when he knew more about her condition. We heard nothing more from either of them. Emails and phone calls went unreturned. Eventually, hoping to find out whether she was alive and healthy, my wife called one of her references, with whom Abby was close — and Abby answered the phone! (She’d gone back to working for this former employer.) My wife panicked and hung up, and then called back and identified herself. This time, Abby hung up. She later told us via email that she had been struggling with depression for a long time and had been hospitalized.

So now I knew that she may have severe depression, which seems material to her ability to safely care for children. And, purely by chance, I knew who her employer was. What was I to do with this information? Was I obligated to tell her employer about her medical condition — which is certainly something I would want to know about someone caring for my children — knowing that it might well get her fired?

Eventually I concluded that medical information is private. If she had been working for any of the millions of families in the state other than the one whose phone number I happened to have, I would not even have had the option to divulge her illness, and that coincidence did not entitle me to violate her privacy. But I would be very interested to hear other opinions, since many months later the decision does not sit entirely easy with me. Name Withheld

Your situation reflects an unsettling fact of ethical life: Chance can impose obligations on you. It doesn’t matter that you learned of Abby’s condition by happenstance, or that you know her current employer by luck. You know what you know. You can do what you can do.

There are general considerations that might weigh against your saying anything. One is the issue of confidentiality that has already raised its reviled head. When people tell you something, they can place reasonable conditions on what you may do with the information. You don’t say that Abby explicitly spoke to you in confidence, though, and you’re not a health professional, bound by physician-patient privilege.

But privacy is another concern. Here, what matters is not how you came by the information but the nature of the information itself. Depending on the context, information about people’s health often falls into this category. Abby’s struggle with severe depression, you feel, is private in just this way. Does that trump your worry about the safety of leaving children in her care?

A lot of what people fear about people with mental illness is unwarranted. The trouble is that you’re not in a position to say whether those with her condition are likelier than others to neglect or otherwise harm children in their care. You don’t know whether her condition is now well controlled.

You’re not in doubt on one point: You’d want to know if a nanny of yours had her medical problems. Of course you would. And, if you did know, you could ask for reassurance from her doctor — which she could permit — about her ability to do her job safely and reliably. What about extending that courtesy to her new employer? (In most states, mental-health professionals have a ‘‘duty to protect’’ that can trump medical confidentiality, where there’s a risk to third parties. But her doctors may not be in the loop about her current occupation.) You’re a compassionate person, and you fear that your candor could get Abby fired. That’s a possibility. Another is that Abby has earned the confidence of her employer. It’s hard to guess how he or she will react. Your own counsel could play a role here.

Finally, suppose this person — having learned Abby’s history, and the fact that you were aware of it — asked you why you hadn’t shared the information. Would your answer be persuasive? Were the tables turned, would it satisfy you? If you genuinely think that Abby’s condition is material to her ability to safely take care of children, a concern for those children should take precedence.",REAL
Judge John Hodgman on a Bone of Contention,"Photo

Dan writes: When I finish a steak at a restaurant, I like to chew on the bone. My fiancée, Liz, thinks it is rude to others and humiliating to her. But steakhouses are expensive. I want to make the most of it. If Liz would like to excuse herself to the restroom while I gnaw, I’d be O.K. with that.

Apart from the basic etiquette violation, you are knowingly embarrassing your fiancée — and, I suspect, really grossing her out. That’s a trick most people save for the predivorce phase of marriage, not courtship. (Don’t think Liz wouldn’t consider this when you order her to sit alone in a bathroom while you chew on a bone.) When we join our life with another’s, we have an obligation to hide our most monstrous odors and habits. So do what I do: Take the bone home and gnaw it alone at 2 a.m. in your underwear in the dark.",REAL
How to Come Out at Thanksgiving,"Photo

‘‘Enjoy your meal first,’’ says Kristin Russo, who told her parents she was a lesbian during a spontaneous post-pie moment in 1998, when she was 17. Coming out at Thanksgiving is very common, especially on that first holiday home from college, says Russo, who went on to co-found Everyone Is Gay, an organization that offers advice and support for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth and their parents. The holiday can be a warm, nonreligious backdrop, particularly if your meal tends to be a more intimate, nuclear-family affair.

There is, of course, no right or wrong time (or way) to come out, but if you opt for Thanksgiving, think through possible outcomes first. ‘‘You need to have a plan,’’ Russo says. This is especially true if there is any chance your family will hurt you, kick you out of the house or withhold college-tuition money. Even if your announcement is welcomed, prepare for everything to stop. Russo recalls the table going quiet and then her mom crying. If your experience goes badly, she says, ‘‘just know that things can change.’’

You might be tempted to open up during a gap between activities — just before the turkey is pulled from the oven, say. Don’t. Choose a more relaxed, satiated moment when there are at least 30 minutes open for discussion. ‘‘Ask your family,’’ Russo says, ‘‘Hey, do you have questions? Can I tell you more about myself?’’ Whether it is dishes or charades, know what the next activity is and lead people to it. ‘‘You can say, We will talk about this more, but for now let’s go watch ‘Planes, Trains and Automobiles.’ ’’ Sometimes it is important to remind your family that you’re still you.

Decide how far you want information to spread. ‘‘If you’re going to tell Aunt Rhonda, be prepared for the rest of creation to know,’’ Russo says. If you’d prefer to keep things among your immediate family, say so. Whether your pronouncement is met with love, concern or we-knew-it-all-along indifference, expect a rush of adrenaline-laced emotions. If at the end of the night, you feel isolated and alone, Russo says, ‘‘Remember, there is a whole world outside of your house.’’",REAL
Going Postal in Turkey,"A few days later I went back, at 3:30 this time. I went upstairs and through a long hallway with stacked buckets and pikes on the walls, some type of firefighter exhibit. Finally I got to something that looked like a cage with a guy inside it, and hundreds of packages from floor to ceiling.

I handed him the slip and he said, ‘‘O.K., O.K.’’ He took out a piece of paper from a shoe box on the counter and handed it to me. Then he sat back and drank his tea. I read the slip. ‘‘You have a package at the Davutpasa post office.’’

I just stood there, stunned. Why send me here? And where was Davutpasa? I searched online for the district, and went there the next week. The neighborhood was like a postapocalyptic hellscape. There were dump trucks thundering by, power lines hanging down and no sidewalks. After half an hour, I came to a massive building that said, ‘‘Davutpasa Postal Center.’’

Inside, I went to one counter and got five forms. I had to go to another building to get them stamped, then go back and stand in line and present them again. Finally I had an inch of paperwork and was sent to another package cage.

The guy took my slip and disappeared. When he returned, he had the box from my mom. He put it on the counter, took out a knife and opened it in front of me. Then he put a seal around it and put it back on the shelf. He said I had to pay 25 million lira, about $15 at the time. ‘‘Import tax,’’ he said.

I went back to the other building, waited in another line, paid the tax and got a stamp. Walking back to the package room I noticed a jingling sound. It was 4:25 — 5 minutes to closing. All the workers were locking their doors, sitting down, starting to have tea. I was like ‘‘NO, NO, NO!’’ I sprinted through the last hallway, but as I approached the package cage, the guy was locking it from the outside. I showed him my receipt. ‘‘Tomorrow,’’ he said.

By then I had had it. Outside, surrounded by factories, with dump trucks passing by, I exploded. I turned around and just gave the finger to the post office. I said it out loud too. Then I began to head back.

On my third attempt I had all the receipts and went to the cage directly. The guy asked for my passport as an ID; I gave it to him. He said, ‘‘O.K.’’ As I stood there waiting, someone suddenly shoved me hard. I turned around, and it was a man in a suit. He looked very angry. He pointed at me, as if to say: ‘‘YOU. You’re the one!’’

The postal worker had come with my package. But the man in the suit pushed it back to him and picked up my passport. Then he pulled out a badge — he was customs police. He imitated me giving the finger to the building. By now, the work in the hallway had stopped and other postal employees were coming over to watch.

‘‘I don’t speak Turkish,’’ I said. The officer asked the people around for help, and a man waddled out of the crowd. ‘‘You must apologize to him,’’ he translated.

‘‘Why?’’ I asked.

‘‘You insulted him. You should apologize to the entire post office.’’

‘‘Maybe they should apologize to me for everything I’ve been through to get my package?’’ I pointed to the customs officer, but he punched away my hand. I just kept refusing to apologize and repeating: ‘‘Give me my passport. Give me my passport.’’ Finally he threw the passport at me. It landed onto the floor. He yelled something in Turkish to the man in the cage, who handed me my box, and then yelled at me, ‘‘Get the hell out, and don’t ever come back again!’’

After that I went to meet my Turkish teacher for a lesson. I was shaken up and told him what happened. ‘‘What’s in the package?’’ he asked. I told him it was a bunch of three-by-five notecards. ‘‘I know where to get those,’’ he said. ‘‘You should have just asked me.’’",REAL
‘Komorebi’,"Between the world and the word are three small shapes, the signs for ‘‘tree,’’ ‘‘escape,’’ and ‘‘sun.’’ I watch how the light leaks through them, casting a shade in both directions in the late year, on the russet path barred with the shadows of trees.

After 10 minutes, I was back in my bedroom. My phone darkened, and the vivid intimations of chaos and resilience began to fade. Yet even now, I breathe, just as they did.

I regret The Times’s apparent decision to begin functioning as if it were a trendy broadcast news outlet. While I believe that the documentary format is a crucial part of media journalism, I think it in dubious taste to tell this particular set of stories in a context so full of spectacularizing visual tricks and special effects. To present the tragic life stories of these children in this particular media format is to trivialize them — the technology itself treads the border between news and entertainment.

Just a few days after I started idly searching Cardboard options on Amazon, one showed up in my driveway. I suspect that, like many of those other 1.2 million [Sunday print subscribers], the first thing I did was to put it on my kid. And I’m pretty sure that means everything. …

In the case of this particular technology, accessibility translates almost immediately into visceral intimacy. Experiencing V.R. for the first time isn’t just cool; it’s revelatory. This is why so many of us made sure to capture the moment of our kids’ first encounter. Most parents, I hope, don’t make videos of their kids’ reactions when we unbox our latest iPhones. But I believe we had a collective sense that our kids were experiencing something meaningfully new — not just an encounter with a new technology, but with a new way of relating to technology.

Especially as a medium for nonfiction, I believe the hype that V.R. can act as a powerful empathy engine, a uniquely direct way to put us in someone else’s world. This makes me hopeful that V.R. will become much more than the next level of escapism for an already screen-addled generation. Marcus Wohlsen, in a post for Wired.com

It is hard to credit the argument that V.R. offers the opportunity for deeper empathy, since the interface is so distracting. It is not just the novelty of the 360-degree view that focuses us on the interface instead of the content. It is the awkwardness of the interface and the absence of a V.R. film language. These early films reveal the need for organizing conventions to orient the viewer and foreground the key details. Janet H. Murray, in a blog post",REAL
"Economists, Biologists and Skrillex on How to Predict the Future","Photo

Lots of people pretend they’ve got tomorrow figured out: tech gurus, politicians, C.E.O.s and (yes) journalists. But if we’re honest with ourselves, the view ahead of us has never been murkier. That’s because the problems that most haunt our world today — climate change and pollution, inequality and war — are problems for which technology, long our spur to envisioning better futures, looks more like a cause than a solution. Our future is hard to imagine because we have trouble imagining how we can possibly act to improve it.

In that spirit, this Future Issue is offered less as a crystal ball than as a meditation on how to think about the future at all. Below, we’ve asked eight experts (through first-person testimonials, compiled by the journalist Ryan Bradley) to describe how they and their industries look forward.

Rade Musulin, chief executive, FBAlliance Insurance

The key is to quantify risk in a numerical or descriptive manner that people can measure and act on. But there’s a continuum of things we can put precise estimates around. For example, car accidents are fairly routine, and we have been estimating the rate for decades, but we lack data for some of the more esoteric risks. Terrorism is a good example. Or something else I’m working on, which is trying to estimate the potential cost to the federal government of rising sea levels. That type of exercise requires a lot more creative thinking and assumptions. We have to review the science, look at things like how much FEMA spent on Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. When you get into the cost of extreme events, you have to use a bit more judgment. We have to apply a lot of art in addition to science.

Jessica Gigot, farmer

We don’t really plan for the weather short-term. That makes me sound like a bad farmer, but I’ve been surprised so many times that I don’t want to get too attached to one scenario. That’s what old farmers tell you: Be open to unpredictability. The drought will continue, that seems to be the consensus. And I may adjust my planting dates, putting in crops early to harvest early, and putting more in late to harvest again late. I kind of go with instincts. There are great farm planners out there and a lot of spreadsheets to follow, but I honestly don’t do that for every crop. You just get in a time bind and could spend all winter doing that and nothing else. Sometimes, it’s scary looking forward as a farmer. From our farm, we can see Mount Baker and the Puget Sound, a volcano and a rising sea. We’re kind of living for the moment, in a geological sense.

Doyne Farmer, co-founder, the Prediction Company

If you have a prediction without any notion of how good it is, it’s worthless. Lately, I’ve been gathering data on what the cost of certain technologies has been, then applying fairly simple forecasting methods to make predictions. You have to pretend we are in the past and don’t know the future. Say we were in 1975, and we’re looking at 2005. Or go back further. Look at solar energy. Ask how much you should invest in solar energy versus nuclear power. The two technologies happened to have come into existence in the 1950s. But follow the forecasting models, and you see that the cost of generating a kilowatt-hour of nuclear power has gone up by a factor of three, while the cost for solar has gone down by a factor of 2,500. If you’re thinking about what to invest in, I’d say solar.

Christina Agapakis, synthetic biologist

There has been a shift in the way we make food and ingredients. It used to be a more chemical approach, breaking things down into discrete parts. But now it’s a more biological approach, building things from the bottom up. One way I think about what might be coming next is to look at the various pressures on agricultural systems and supply chains. For example, take Turkish rose oil: There was a late frost this year, and there is a real shortage of rose petals. It takes thousands of petals to produce just a few drops of the oil. We looked at the chemistry of those scents. What are all the components and the biology of how the rose creates those scents? What do humans smell? And we take those genes and transfer them into a yeast, and it does its own yeasty things to make those same smells.

Jim O’Sullivan, economist, high frequency economics

In market forecasting, you look for a consistent pattern over time. A number that’s standing alone, you have to dismiss it, and you have to take into account that some numbers are notoriously volatile. The monthly employment report is hugely important, and if you look at the last two months of data, it looks as if there’s a slowing, but is this a significant slowdown or noise? I look for corroboration. Look at weekly jobless claims. Almost invariably, net employment slows down as jobless claims trend up, but in October the four-week moving average of claims was the lowest since 1973. So maybe there’s no slowing. Momentum is important. It’s a bit like when you’re using a map to figure out where you’re going: Your first task is to determine where you are.

The future is an accident. It’s an accident because you explore. You have to go through with a machete and just hack away and find it. You can’t see it — you just have to go somewhere you haven’t been before. It’s not even about being so far into the future; it’s “How do you say what people want to hear next?” I’m always listening to what the younger kids are doing. The most inspiring stuff is what you find young kids doing online. It’s so raw. It’s, like, the singularity, the way children are interfacing with different technologies so seamlessly. I was in South Africa and went to this township, and the kids there had really cheap smartphones, and they could still build a window into another world, then adapt that to their culture. Some kids had D.J. gear in a little shack, and they were making this hack between house and African, like African house. Kids! Like, 8 years old. That’s where I’m getting ideas.

Ian Duncan, professor of actuarial science

The courses I teach at the University of California, Santa Barbara, are foundational: compound interest and life contingencies. Compound interest is about the time value of money. A dollar in 20 years will not be worth what it is today, so what’s the value today of a dollar in the future? Life contingencies introduces probabilities: Instead of thinking about it as a dollar in 20 years’ time, it’s a dollar in 20 years if you’re still alive. We’re very concerned with people outliving their assets: If you ask the average person his or her life expectancy, they’ll significantly underestimate it. The profession is very data driven. The good aspect is that it’s rigorous; the bad aspect is that it trains you to believe there’s a right and wrong answer to every question and no shades of gray.

Forecasting in color is not throwing darts. It’s not “This color hasn’t been hot — let’s do that.” We look for new color influences. There are always the obvious places, like fashion, or cosmetics. The other places are not as obvious but are in pop culture too. We look at what films are in production and even earlier: What’s on the drawing board? That may have a color story that’s attached to it, a mood. “Shrek” is an example. I can remember seeing the early drawings in Variety, and seeing that bright yellow green. That’s a color that hasn’t been prominent, I thought. We need to pay attention to that. And then in “Monsters, Inc.,” too, that bright yellow green again. And because it’s on the drawing board now, it’ll have the biggest impact in a year or two.",REAL
"You, Only Better","Asprey says he finally lost faith in Western medicine at 23, when a doctor told him that vitamin C could kill him. It turns out this isn’t true, but for Asprey it was the last straw. As a boy, he suffered from inexplicable rashes and alarming, recurring nosebleeds. He says he also felt a mental sluggishness that never seemed to recede. This frightened him, especially as he entered college. By the time he was 22, he weighed 300 pounds. He bought disability insurance when he was about 25 because he was worried that there would come a day when he wouldn’t have enough energy to work.

His poor health didn’t hold back his career. Asprey rose through a series of high-profile positions at several successful technology companies in the ’90s and ’00s. Still, he felt restless and unhappy. In 1995, determined to get his weight under control, he spent 18 months on a strict diet and exercised six days a week. He got stronger, but lost little fat. And the food restrictions made him even more miserable.

Photo

In the ’90s, Asprey studied a form of information management called a decision support system at California State University, Stanislaus. Such systems use artificial intelligence to analyze data and present it so users can more easily make difficult business decisions. Asprey decided to apply similar tactics to his health. He began closely tracking his food intake alongside his energy levels, mood, sleep and physical activity to create a data set so he could see what patterns emerged — which inputs correlated with positive outcomes and which didn’t.

After his failed low-calorie diet, he tried others: the Zone, Atkins, raw veganism, high-protein and intermittent fasting. At the same time, he went to extreme lengths to collect additional data on his body’s performance. He had adrenal testing done to better understand how his hormones worked; extensive blood work let him monitor his glucose and albumin levels. He got DNA tests to look for genes that might cause immuno­deficiency and sent out samples of his feces to learn about the microbes in his digestive tract. He bought an electroencepha­logram, or EEG machine, to monitor his brain waves. Once, in 2006, hoping to treat gut problems, he placed an order online for a shipment of parasites called porcine whipworm. The eggs arrived from Thailand a few days later in a saline solution. He drank the whole thing hoping they would trigger an anti-inflammatory reaction in his gut. They didn’t.

In all, Asprey says, he has spent more than $300,000 over 20 years on this self-funded research. He talks about himself almost as a lab rat, or as a monkey that was shot into space and returned intact, bearing data to share. But, with his background in computer science, he also fancies himself a hacker — someone who endlessly manipulates a complex system, troubleshooting and looking for vulnerabilities to exploit.

He eventually developed his dietary guidelines, which emphasize that half the day’s calories should come from healthy fats like coconut oil and avocados. Asprey believes these provide more energy and satiation than carbohydrates. The rest is a mix of organic proteins and vegetables. It is both strict and decadent. Sugar (including fruit), grains, legumes and pasteurized dairy are to be avoided, as are many trendy health food items like raw kale and nut milks, which Asprey says contain toxins. The diet is ketogenic; it forces the body to burn fat, instead of carbohydrates and glucose, for energy.

The centerpiece of the Bulletproof Diet — and the business — is Bulletproof Coffee: a blend of freshly brewed coffee, the Brain Octane oil and grass-fed butter, consumed at the beginning of each day to boost energy and curb hunger. It comes with a remarkable patter. In 2004, as part of his campaign of self-improvement, Asprey went to Tibet to study meditation. On a trek in the Himalayas, he began to feel the effects of altitude sickness. At a local guesthouse, he was served a cup of tea mixed with yak butter, which he found to be revitalizing and energizing. After returning home, he tried to make his own version, and eventually landed on the recipe he sells today — almost.

Asprey and Bulletproof employees are fond of asking whether you’ve had ‘‘real’’ Bulletproof Coffee — meaning not made with store-bought butter and coconut oil in your kitchen, but with their branded products. Asprey insists that most American coffee is riddled with a fungus that causes a post-consumption crash. He is especially hung up on mold toxins, or mycotoxins, which he believes were responsible for the health conditions that afflicted him while growing up. The mold in American coffee, he says, leads to illnesses, inflammation and weight gain. Asprey sells his own specially treated mold-free coffee for as much as $18.95 a pound online and at the shop. Next month, he is releasing a Bulletproof cookbook.

Despite some superficial signs of age, Asprey’s face is unlined, and after a while his self-assuredness and unflinching confidence in his methodology becomes contagious. Listening to his story, I stopped questioning his logic. I found myself growing impatient as he described the benefits of his medicine cabinet of ‘‘brain nutrients,’’ and asked for some — ‘‘I feel like I need them,’’ I said. An assistant brought in freshly blended cups of Bulletproof Coffee in Bulletproof-branded stainless-steel travel mugs. The fattiness of the butter and oil lent the coffee a mouth feel similar to Guinness. After a few sips, I started to feel giddy, and almost high — as if I could run a marathon and deliver a keynote lecture and do my taxes, all at once.

The next morning, I arrived at the Pasadena Convention Center for the first day of the Bulletproof Biohacking conference. Inside, the crowd was almost comically Southern Californian. The bodies were firm, the jawlines sharp. The women were no strangers to cosmetic enhancement, and most of the men wore aggressively sculpted updos or low-slung man buns. Five-toe Vibram shoes and neoprene yoga pants were the popular pan-gender wardrobe choices. This was the vanguard of the quantified-consumer class — health-conscious Angelenos, the same types who were early adopters of the Master Cleanse and green juices.

The event was billed as a cutting-edge biohacking event, but it was tame compared with what goes on at the fringes of this community. Seven months earlier and about two hours away, in Tehachapi, a much more extreme clique of biohackers gathered to share the recent discoveries from their world at a gathering called GrindFest. These are the real transhumanists, the kind of people who implant magnets under their skin and embed microchips in their bodies to replace key cards. Asprey’s ethos is not so dissimilar — he wants to push humanity past its biological limits — but his sell is a little more palatable: We need only think of our bodies as hardware in order to improve upon them.

Little of the technology on display at the Bulletproof convention was new. No one was being implanted or fused with anything. They preferred to upgrade the old-fashioned way, with a miracle drug or pill or elixir that would transform them from the inside out, and there was no shortage of products that promised to do so. The Bulletproof Coffee was abundant, as were the Bulletproof-branded collagen bars, grass-fed meat jerky and small paper cups of steaming, earthy bone broth. There were samples of Fat Water, a new Bulletproof sports drink infused with a certain fatty acid that Asprey believes the body processes into energy more efficiently than it does glucose. There were Bulletproof-branded supplements, like glutathione, an antioxidant that Asprey says helps detoxify the body. I narrowly missed the cricket brownies smeared with colostrum icing — the crowd descended on them as soon as they were set out. I watched a woman drip a tincture made from deer antlers on the eager tongue of a slim and handsome attendee. I rolled my eyes at a hypnotist putting a woman into a trance, and then, hours later, the same hypnotist talked me into taking an injection of vitamins labeled simply a ‘‘shine shot.’’ (He had taken one, too.)

There are more than a few nutritionists who are dubious of Asprey’s bold claims. It’s hard not to be — there’s little research outside his own that backs them up. Asprey’s diet advises against calorie counting. It is also high in fat. Marion Nestle, an author and professor of nutrition and public health at New York University, is among those skeptical of what Asprey is selling. ‘‘I don’t know any diet, exercise or healthful-living shortcuts,’’ she wrote in an emailed exchange. ‘‘We all want to live forever, and if changing one thing in our diets can do that, we can all hope. The success of the dietary-supplement industry is best explained by wish-fulfillment fantasies.’’

On the day before the conference began, I asked Asprey about his childhood. He quickly rattled off a few sentences about his parents. They worked at Sandia National Laboratories, which taught him the value of scientific inquiry. That wasn’t what I had meant. Were his parents particularly health-oriented? Or did he grow up eating takeout and frozen meals? He gave a dismissive shrug. ‘‘My parents gave me squeeze margarine and bran muffins because that’s what the magazines said,’’ he said. He paused for a moment, reconsidering. ‘‘They did their best.’’

During the ’80s, when Asprey was a kid, eating bran muffins was the fad diet of the day — that, and a little Jazzercise, and you’d be set. Eventually, people came to recognize that the benefits of the fiber were canceled out by the heavy ca­loric load and sugars. Margarine was also peaking in popularity around that time, seen then as a sensible alternative to butter. But since then, nutritionists have questioned the wisdom of the low-fat, high-carb diet that Americans have been steered toward for years. Asprey’s diet is, for all its technological fervor, a refutation of the last generation’s hollow wisdom. In its avoidance of complex carbohydrates and its pseudoscientific rhetoric, it’s not so dissimilar from the Paleo diet — along with a bunch of supplements that would befuddle a cave man, or even a New Yorker.

My own parents were trim and active; they were also Southern, which meant that butter-and-sugar sandwiches and cheese grits were staples of our diet. I was a heavy teenager, with more acne and eczema than I’d like to remember, and it wasn’t until my 20s that I understood the role dietary habits played in that. Since then, I’ve endlessly experimented with raw diets, green juices, Paleo-inspired meal plans and various cultish boutique fitness classes, trying to figure out what works best to maintain a healthy weight. I still don’t have a definitive answer. Fad diets persist because they are seductive, and offer the promise of unlocking a better you by following a few simple rules. And Asprey’s pitch couldn’t be more epistemologically fashionable: A/B testing, hacking and data analysis have already provided us with many novel insights and conveniences.

Asprey believes that nutrition should be as effortless as everything else in our technology-enhanced existence — why shouldn’t it be? His background is in information management, and that is what he is skilled at: distilling oceanic volumes of information for easy consumption and decision-making. The allure of the Bulletproof lifestyle is that you can outsource that work. ‘‘That fundamental laziness, where I want everything to be easier, is part of what drives me,’’ he told me that first day. ‘‘I don’t want to do more work than is necessary to do great things. I don’t see why anyone should do more work than is necessary to do great things.’’",REAL
The Crispr Quandary,"The tool Doudna ultimately created with her collaborators paired Crispr’s programmable guide RNA with a shortened tracer RNA. Used in combination, the system allowed researchers to target and excise any gene they wanted — or even edit out a single base pair within a gene. (When researchers want to add a gene, they can use Crispr to stitch it between the two cut ends.) Some researchers have compared Crispr to a word processor, capable of effortlessly editing a gene down to the level of a single letter.

Even more surprising was how easy the system was to use. To edit a gene, a scientist simply had to take a strand of guide RNA and include an ‘‘address’’: a short string of letters corresponding to a particular location on the gene. The process was so straightforward, one scientist told me, that a grad student could master it in an hour, and produce an edited gene within a couple of days. ‘‘In the past, it was a student’s entire Ph.D. thesis to change one gene,’’ says Bruce Conklin, a geneticist at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco. ‘‘Crispr just knocked that out of the park.’’

II.

Genetic engineering has wrought spectacular changes in the years since it was first developed in 1973. By breeding mice to have particular mutations, researchers have been able to explore the roots of diseases including cystic fibrosis and diabetes. It has also opened the door to new hybrids: pest-resistant corn with genes taken from bacteria, for instance, and yeast modified to churn out an antimalarial drug. As of 2014, the market for genetically engineered products was worth almost $2 billion — a number that is expected to double over the next five years.

But despite these advances, the process of altering genes has remained laborious and inexact. Engineering a mouse with a single mutation took a dedicated lab almost two years, and even that was something of a crapshoot. Altered genes frequently ended up in random locations, or else in widely varying numbers — no copies in one cell, a dozen copies in another — often with confounding results. One scientist told me that before Crispr, he had to microinject roughly a million cells in order to get one perfect mutation. With Crispr, he could get the same result using just 10 cells.

And mice were the best case. Other animals were far harder to engineer — weirdly, even rats were difficult — and many couldn’t be altered at all, for reasons nobody really understood. ‘‘There’s a reason the mouse became the model animal for human diseases,’’ notes Tom Cech, director of the University of Colorado’s BioFrontiers Institute and a Nobel laureate. ‘‘Before Crispr, trying to genetically modify any other animal was either impossible, or impossible to do with any kind of precision.’’ And because scientists could alter only a single gene at a time, moreover, they could barely scratch the surface of many disorders, like cardiovascular disease, that were thought to involve multiple, or, in some cases, even dozens of genes. ‘‘What most people don’t realize is how limited we were before Crispr came along,’’ Cech says. ‘‘The tools we had were extremely crude.’’

In the era of Crispr (short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, a reference to the gene’s structure), those limitations are already disappearing. In October, Harvard researchers used Crispr to simultaneously alter 62 genes in pig embryos, creating animals that could, at least in theory, grow human organs for transplant. Uncannily, the tool also seemed to work in nearly every organism, from silkworms to monkeys, and also in every cell type: kidney, heart and those, like T-cells, that researchers had previously struggled to modify. In early November, the biotechnology start-up Editas Medicine announced that it planned to test a Crispr-based gene therapy technique in hopes of curing a rare form of blindness, by deleting part of a gene that controls the eye’s photoreceptor cells. But most researchers believe that Crispr’s biggest impact will be in speeding up the drug pipeline. Drug development currently relies, in part, on genome-wide association studies to identify mutations that people with a certain disease have in common. The problem is that those studies typically turn up hundreds of loosely associated mutations, each of which may or may not actually relate to the disease. (Some of them may be caused by the disease.) Before Crispr, it was so difficult to edit a single gene accurately that researchers had no easy way to test which mutations actually mattered, and thus which ones to target when looking for a cure.

That alone would qualify as a major advance, but Crispr’s reach will almost certainly be far greater — in part because so many industries now rely on genetic engineering. Re­searchers have begun using Crispr to develop better bio­fuels and to create new enzymes for industrial markets, where they’re used in laundry detergents, water treatment and paper milling. In agriculture, companies are using Crispr to make crops more pest- and drought-resistant, without using genes spliced in from other species, like a flounder gene inside a tomato. (DuPont is collaborating with Doudna’s company, Caribou Biosciences, to grow Crispr-edited corn and wheat, which are expected to reach supermarkets within five years.) Livestock breeders can harness it to produce animals with more muscle mass and leaner meat, faster and more predictably than with ordinary crossbreeding. Food conglomerates, including Dannon, are already deploying Crispr to create strains of bacteria that produce more flavorful yogurt; other fermented foods — cheese, bread, pickles — will probably follow.

For researchers studying complicated psychiatric disorders, Crispr may be a particular boon. ‘‘The major roadblock in that whole field has been that mice are just not good models,’’ says Feng Zhang, a biologist at the Broad Institute who pioneered the use of Crispr in human cells. ‘‘They often don’t even have the same brain structures as are affected in those diseases.’’ Zhang and Robert Desimone, director of M.I.T.’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, are among a number of researchers now hoping to use Crispr to generate primate models for illnesses like autism and schizophrenia, which are thought to involve multiple mutations in a variety of combinations.

Farther afield, researchers are considering how Crispr might be used to eliminate malarial mosquitoes, or target invasive species like Asian carp in the Great Lakes. ‘‘There’s an almost frantic feeling of discovery,’’ one scientist told me. ‘‘Crispr has made so many experiments possible — it’s like standing in a candy store and knowing that you can choose just three things. Meanwhile, there are a thousand more experiments that you wish you could try, if only you had the time.’’ One prominent scientist estimated that Crispr was now being used by nearly every genetic-engineering lab in the world.

Rodolphe Barrangou, a biologist at North Carolina State University who was on the team that first identified Crispr as part of a bacterial immune system, notes that it is nearly unprecedented for a single tool to result in such a scrum. ‘‘You’ve got Fortune 50 companies fighting with start-ups fighting with universities,’’ he says. ‘‘That almost never happens. But with Crispr, the range of potential uses is so huge — everybody wants in.’’

III.

These days, Doudna works out of a lofty office with sweeping views of San Francisco Bay and U.C. Berkeley’s elegant marble bell tower in the foreground. On the day I arrived this spring, her husband, Jamie Cate, a biochemist specializing in protein formation and bio­fuels, was finishing lunch at his desk before catching a flight to Chicago, where he was slated to give a talk. Cate relocated his office several years ago so it would be next to Doudna’s; the couple has a 13-year-old son, and they try to avoid scheduling work trips that overlap — a process that has lately become more challenging. ‘‘Jennifer’s schedule is. ... ’’ Cate rolled his eyes. ‘‘Working next door to her is sometimes the only way we can coordinate.’’

In person, Doudna is politely formidable. Tall and rail-thin, she has an unusual intensity; talking with her feels a bit like sitting opposite a heron as it eyeballs an unpromising fish. Among the scientists I spoke to, nearly all mentioned the uncanny nature of Doudna’s intuition; more than one described her as having ‘‘a kind of sixth sense’’ about which problems to tackle. ‘‘Everybody would love to be the one to identify the game-changing problem and solve it,’’ says Blake Weidenheft, a professor at the Montana State University who has also spent time in Doudna’s lab. ‘‘But when you’re looking around, trying to figure out what to work on, it’s not at all obvious which path is going to lead to that kind of breakthrough. That’s something Jennifer is very good at.’’

Doudna’s interest in science developed early. In the 1970s, her father, Martin, got a job teaching literature at the University of Hawaii, and the family settled in Hilo. At the time, Hilo had what a former schoolmate, Lisa Twigg-Smith, described as ‘‘a sugar-plantation culture’’ — multiethnic, blue-collar, tough — and Doudna, with her blond hair and earnest interest in school, stood out. ‘‘I was kind of a nerdy, geeky type,’’ Doudna says. ‘‘And I loved math. People teased me about it. I felt pretty much like an outcast.’’

In sixth grade, Doudna began spending time with Twigg-Smith. Both girls lived in a tract-home development where, Twigg-Smith says, ‘‘every third house was the same.’’ The development was new, but it was built into wild countryside; after school, Lisa would ride her bicycle over to Jennifer’s house, and the girls would head up the cane road, an overgrown track that led to a nearby sugar-cane field. The landscape was rugged and lush, a plane of steep lava rock overgrown with ferns and cut with flooded meadows where the grass grew in clumps.

‘‘We spent a lot of time walking and looking, just talking about whatever was the topic of the day,’’ Twigg-Smith says. ‘‘We’d follow wild-pig trails, or else we’d just look at things — at mosses that were in bloom, or mushrooms.’’ While on these walks, Doudna became interested in a species of mimosa known locally as hila-hila, or sleeping grass. The plant’s runners were thorny and tough, but its leaves were unexpectedly delicate and folded shut if touched. Doudna recalls being fascinated — not by the plant, but by the mechanism that drove it. ‘‘I’d look at that and think: Now, how does that work? There’s some chemical change that responds to touch, that allows these leaves to close. But what is it? I couldn’t imagine.’’

She was encouraged by a family friend, Don Hemmes, a biologist who specialized in fungi. She spent a summer working in his lab, collecting samples and embedding them in resins, then examining thin slices under an electron microscope. Though many teenagers would have found the work tedious, Doudna was captivated by it. ‘‘I looked forward to going in every day,’’ she says. ‘‘I would get this feeling — a sort of excitement. Like, ‘I’m going to uncover a mystery today!’ ’’

From the start, Doudna told me, she has been drawn not to the larger forces in the natural world but to the hidden, microscopic mechanisms that drive it: the molecular chain that magically makes the hila-hila close. But in many ways she was an unlikely genetics pioneer. Before developing Crispr, Doudna had little experience editing genes and had never worked in human or animal research. And while she was well known in her field, her work — which focused on the structure and function of various kinds of RNA — was considered abstruse, even by science standards. ‘‘It’s a pretty rarefied interest,’’ one scientist told me. ‘‘To be good at it, you have to be very patient and meticulous.’’

More Reporting on Gene Editing

At the time Doudna began studying RNA, in graduate school, the molecule was thought of primarily as a go-between: When a coil of DNA unzipped, the RNA would copy the orders encoded by a given gene, then ferry those instructions over to the cell’s protein-making machinery, which would use them as a blueprint for snapping together amino acids. But even as public attention (and research grants) focused on familiar problems like sequencing genes, the future was quietly arriving from another direction. To everyone’s surprise, RNA turned out to be both more diverse and more powerful than researchers imagined: Thousands of varieties have been identified, some with the power to turn genes on or off, or to disable invaders by jamming their genetic machinery. While DNA is a library containing all our genes, in other words, RNA is more like a fleet of dynamic librarians, constantly cataloging and patrolling the stacks.

Doudna made her name as a postdoctoral researcher by mapping the structure of a particular type of RNA known as a ribozyme: a molecule able to catalyze chemical reactions by twisting to bring different atoms in contact with one another. Researchers typically figure out how something like a ribozyme functions by laboriously tracing the individual interactions among atoms — a process that Tom Cech, who was Doudna’s postdoctoral adviser, likened to mapping a forest at night by feeling your way from tree to tree.

Having a detailed image of a ribozyme would bypass that process, but there was a reason that no such thing existed. At the time that Doudna began her work, Cech says, only a single RNA structure had been mapped in 20 years of attempts — and that one was much smaller and simpler. Mapping all the elements in something as complex as a ribozyme was widely assumed to be impossible. As Cech put it, ‘‘If we had asked the N.I.H. to fund this project, we would have been laughed out of the room.’’

The project took three years, but Doudna and her collaborators eventually succeeded. ‘‘They basically showed that this thing that people thought was absolutely impossible — imaging the 3-D structure of large RNA molecules — actually was possible,’’ Cech says. Doudna’s success started a stampede among researchers and was the beginning of the thriving field of RNA imaging. ‘‘She has an uncanny knack for picking the best experiments to answer a question,’’ Cech says. ‘‘From an early age, she had this talent for solving very daunting problems. Her whole career, in some ways, was preparation for Crispr.’’

IV.

One day this summer, I joined Doudna for a meeting at Caribou Biosciences, the biotech company she helped found in 2012. These days, much of the company’s research — like the research being done in hundreds of other labs — is focused on refining the Crispr technology and reducing its ‘‘off target’’ effects, where the Crispr mechanism cuts the gene in the wrong place.

That morning, Doudna was just back from testifying before a Senate committee that had been convened to grapple with Crispr’s implications — as well as its potential for misuse. A postdoctoral student described a process for making mice that had a mutation associated with human lung cancer, by using Crisprs packed into a virus that could be inhaled. Highly accurate mouse models of lung cancer could be made much faster, radically accelerating the pace of research. This was exciting but also alarming. As Doudna has said, a minor mistake in the design of the guide RNA could result in a virus that introduced the same cancer-causing mutations into human lungs. ‘‘It seemed incredibly scary that you might have students who were working with such a thing,’’ Doudna said in an interview with the journal Nature. ‘‘It’s important for people to appreciate what this technology can do.’’ While Crispr has opened the door to a huge number of experiments that were previously impossible, it has also enabled almost anyone to try them.

In March, for instance, researchers figured out how to use Crispr to create a ‘‘mutagenic chain reaction’’ — one that speeds up how quickly a mutated species can be produced. But because the chain-reaction mechanism is inherited, scientists note, it’s risky: Should the system escape to the wild, the mutation could end up in every plant or animal in the population.

Similar debates have surrounded even the earliest technologies for editing genes, as Doudna is keenly aware. In 2012, just months after Crispr debuted, she organized a meeting in Napa, Calif., to discuss the ethical issues this new technology raised. The concern at the time, Doudna explained, was whether someone might use Crispr to change the DNA of human embryos before the technology was genuinely ready. In April, researchers at Sun Yat-sen University in China published a paper describing how they used Crispr to edit a human embryo to repair the gene responsible for a potentially life-threatening blood disorder, though the embryos used weren’t viable and thus couldn’t be carried to term. Such experimentation is currently under a voluntary moratorium in the United States and tightly regulated in Europe. Researchers at Britain’s Francis Crick Institute recently petitioned for permission to pursue it, arguing that experiments like these could provide ‘‘fundamental insights into early human development.’’

There’s a vast difference between using Crispr to study embryonic development in the lab and using it to create a genetically modified infant who lives and grows to adulthood. (Which is again different from using Crispr to do gene therapy by fixing a mutation in cells taken out of a patient, then infusing those cells back in.) In practice, Doudna has said, it will most likely be years before we can safely edit the DNA of an embryo. But she also notes that the prospect of editing embryos so that they don’t carry disease-causing genes goes to the heart of Crispr’s potential. She has received email from young women with the BRCA breast-cancer mutation, asking whether Crispr could keep them from passing that mutation on to their children — not by selecting embryos in vitro, but by removing the mutation from the child’s genetic code altogether. ‘‘So at some point, you have to ask: What if we could rid a person’s germ line, and all their future generations, of that risk?’’ Doudna observed. ‘‘When does one risk outweigh another?’’

Debates are already simmering over whether certain qualities, including deafness, should actually be considered valuable sources of human diversity instead of disabilities. (The neurodiversity movement has made a similar case for Asperger’s, arguing that people with the diagnosis don’t need fixing: They just think differently, in ways that aren't necessarily worse.) The other challenge will lie in how we’ll assess the inevitable risks inherent in creating the first genetically modified human. While researchers will surely work hard to mitigate those dangers — in part by testing Crispr extensively, on both human embryos and in animals, including primates — it’s not possible to foresee every potential error, genetic interaction or unintended consequence.

Should embryo-editing eventually become a realistic possibility, it will still require a leap. But it also won’t be the first time that we have created such a tool. The trick will be in deciding when the potential benefits of such a modification — a child who can’t get H.I.V., say, or is less likely to develop Alzheimer’s — outweigh the possible downsides.

Even as editing genes in human embryos remains a long way off, Doudna recognizes that it won’t always be. At the meeting in Napa, she said, ‘‘Someone at the table said, ‘There may come a time when, ethically, we can’t not do this.’ ’’ She paused. ‘‘That kind of made everybody sit back and think about it differently.’’",REAL
The Dream Life of Driverless Cars,"On a brisk afternoon in October, an oddly-­equipped Honda CR-V inched through London traffic. At the wheel was Matthew Shaw, a 32-year-old architectural designer; with him was a fellow designer, William Trossell, 30, and a small team of laser-­scanner operators. All were skilled in their technical fields, but their goal was art. What they hoped to scan was not just the shape of the city streets but the inner life of the autonomous cars that may soon come to dominate them.

Shaw and Trossell have been fascinated by 3-D scanning since they met in architecture school. There, they investigated how laser scanners perceive the built environment, including the biases, blind spots and peculiar insights any such technology must encompass. In 2010, they started ScanLAB Projects, a London design studio, to widen that investigation. As they already knew, laser-­scanning equipment could easily be fooled by applying it in inappropriate conditions or simply misusing the gear. Solid objects, whether architectural ruins, geological forms or commercial buildings in the heart of London, are particularly amenable to scanning. Fog banks, mist and afternoon drizzle, not so much. Yet Trossell and Shaw’s early work was devoted precisely to this: pushing the technology into unexpected realms where things, by definition, could not go as planned. Setting up their laser scanner deep in the woods, they captured low rolling clouds of mist as digital blurs haunting the landscape; moving ice floes scanned from a ship north of the Arctic Circle took shape in their hard drives as overlapping labyrinths on the verge of illegibility, as if the horizon of the world itself had begun to buckle. These first projects, commissioned by organizations like the BBC and Greenpeace, have since blossomed into a new approach: mapping London through the robot eyes of a self-­driving car.

One of the most significant uses of 3-D scanning in the years to come will not be by humans at all but by autonomous vehicles. Cars are already learning to drive themselves, by way of scanner-­assisted braking, pedestrian-­detection sensors, parallel-­parking support, lane-­departure warnings and other complex driver-­assistance systems, and full autonomy is on the horizon. Google’s self-­driving cars have logged more than a million miles on public roads; Elon Musk of Tesla says he’ll probably have a driverless passenger car by 2018; and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers says autonomous vehicles ‘‘will account for up to 75 percent of cars on the road by the year 2040.’’ Driver-­controlled cars remade the world in the last century, and there is good reason to expect that driverless cars will remake it again in the century to come: Gridlock could become extinct as cars steer themselves along a cooperatively evolving lacework of alternative routes, like information traversing the Internet. With competing robot cars just a smartphone ­tap away, the need for street parking could evaporate, freeing up as much as a third of the entire surface area of some major American cities. And as distracted drivers are replaced by unblinking machines, roads could become safer for everyone.

Sight Lines To see how driverless cars might perceive — and misperceive — the world, ScanLAB Projects drove a 3-D laser scanner through the streets of London.

But all of that depends on cars being able to navigate the built environment. The cars now being tested by Google, BMW, Ford and others all see by way of a particular kind of scanning system called lidar (a portmanteau of ‘‘light’’ and ‘‘radar’’). A lidar scanner sends out tiny bursts of illumination invisible to the human eye, almost a million every second, that bounce off every building, object and person in the area. This undetectable machine-­flicker is ‘‘capturing’’ extremely detailed, millimeter-­scale measurements of the surrounding environment, far more accurate than anything achievable by the human eye. Capturing resembles photography, but it operates volumetrically, producing a complete three-­dimensional model of a scene. The extreme accuracy of lidar lends it an air of infallible objectivity; a clean scan of a stationary structure can be so precise that nonprofit organizations like CyArk have been using lidar as a tool for archaeological preservation in conflict zones, hoping to capture at-­risk sites of historical significance before they are destroyed.

Lidar, however, has its own flaws and vulnerabilities. It can be thrown off by reflective surfaces or inclement weather, by mirrored glass or the raindrops of a morning thunderstorm. As the first wave of autonomous vehicles emerges, engineers are struggling with the complex, even absurd, circumstances that constitute everyday street life. Consider the cyclist in Austin, Tex., who found himself caught in a bizarre standoff with one of Google’s self-­driving cars. Having arrived at a four-­way stop just seconds after the car, the cyclist ceded his right of way. Rather than coming to a complete halt, however, he performed a track stand, inching back and forth without putting his feet on the ground. Paralyzed with indecision, the car mirrored the cyclist’s own movements — jerking forward and stopping, jerking forward and stopping — unsure if the cyclist was about to enter the intersection. As the cyclist later wrote in an online forum, ‘‘two guys inside were laughing and punching stuff into a laptop, I guess trying to modify some code to ‘teach’ the car something about how to deal with the situation.’’",REAL
The Secrets in Greenland’s Ice Sheet,"Pine Island and Thwaites are not likely to collapse as gutted buildings do. They will slowly disintegrate until they have calved enough icebergs to produce about four feet of sea-­level rise. The fundamental question is how slowly: decades or centuries? Only a small number of men and women in the world worry about this distinction, yet the future of thousands of cities hinges upon it. When I asked Richard Alley, almost certainly the most respected glaciologist in the United States, whether he would be surprised to see Thwaites collapse in his lifetime, he drew a breath. Alley is 58. ‘‘Up until very recently, I would have said, ‘Yes, I’d be surprised,’ ’’ he told me. ‘‘Right now, I’m not sure. I’m still cautiously optimistic that in my life, Thwaites has got enough stability on the ridge where it now sits that I will die before it does. But I’m not confident about that for my kids. And if someday I have grandkids, I’m not at all confident for them.’’

Rignot answers the same question more bluntly. ‘‘That’s what we’re seeing right now — they are in a state of collapse,’’ he says. ‘‘We’ve never seen it before, so it’s hard to identify it and say, ‘We know exactly what it looks like, and this is what it looks like.’ We’re still in the early stage.’’ Rignot predicts that in 30 or 40 years, people will be accustomed to watching Thwaites and Pine Island disintegrate constantly, iceberg by iceberg, into the ocean. And by then, he adds, their collapse ‘‘will be a part of everyday life.’’

Earth’s geological history, together with the contours of ancient shorelines, tell us two things about ice-­sheet collapse. The first is that great quantities of ice can fall into the ocean rapidly, at rates far exceeding what is happening today. The second is that even if sea-­level rises don’t happen quickly in the near future, they will happen eventually. As Alley told me, the historical record points in two directions: ‘‘Sea-­level rise could be scary in magnitude but not in rate. Or it could be scary in magnitude and rate if our warming reproduces what happened in the past.’’

We might imagine a rapid collapse of the ice sheets in B-­movie terms: sudden and terrifying, with enormous waves of water cresting over beachside homes in Malibu, Calif., and nature reclaiming the Rockaways. In truth, the remoteness of the sources of new icebergs means no devastating tsunamis. Because the calving would happen over the course of many decades rather than weeks, the catastrophe would manifest over time. First there is water in the basements, gutters and subways; then, storms regularly bringing water into the streets. Year by year, the rise accelerates. Brine infiltrates drinking-­water systems and sewer plants; electrical grids spark out. Flood-­insurance policies are discontinued, and home values plummet. Row by row, seaside homes are abandoned. Still the rise continues. Large-­scale evacuation then becomes imperative — as long as inland cities and funds are available for relocation. In low-­lying countries, however, the implications of significant sea-­level rise, and the occasional storm surges that amplify the floodwaters, move beyond the economic to the existential. ‘‘On these longer time scales,’’ says Anders Levermann, a sea-­level expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, ‘‘the magnitude of the sea-­level rise could get so big that we have to evacuate New York, Calcutta, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hamburg and most of the Netherlands.’’

When Rignot talks about catastrophic events happening over a short period, he sometimes mentions an event in earth’s past known as ‘‘Meltwater Pulse 1A.’’ This occurred about 14,500 years ago and lasted roughly three centuries. As global temperatures warmed — the last ice age was just ending — parts of the Antarctic ice sheet, along with an ice sheet that once covered parts of northeastern Canada, shattered into the ocean as icebergs. Over this period, ocean levels probably increased at around nine or 10 feet per century, many times even the extreme rate projected by the international panel. Rignot isn’t certain that this is our destiny; large sea-­level rises in the past can differ from today in terms of location and the forces acting upon the ice sheets. But 1A makes Rignot believe that we can’t rule out the possibility of a very fast event.

As for the question of how high oceans will eventually rise, the answer is less speculative. Ice sheets are what might be called lagging indicators; they can take hundreds or thousands of years to adjust to a new environment. But the laws of physics ultimately bring them into equilibrium. We know from climatology research and the residue of ancient shorelines that past carbon concentrations similar to today’s concentrations are associated with higher temperatures in the Arctic and Antarctic, ice-­sheet collapse and higher oceans. Scientists who study sea-­level rise sometimes call these longer-­term effects a ‘‘commitment’’ — that is, sea levels that we are committed to over the long haul if our current rates of carbon-­dioxide emissions continue. The effects of CO₂ are akin to rolling a large stone down a big hill: Eventually, it gains so much momentum that it cannot be stopped.

In July, a research team led by Andrea Dutton, a professor at the University of Florida, published a study on commitments that concluded that even a tiny swing in global average temperatures ultimately leads to substantial rises in sea level. For instance, she told me, if we compare today to earth’s last warm period — one that occurred about 120,000 years ago — ‘‘we do know the poles were at least a few degrees warmer.’’ Earth isn’t quite at that point, but projections for the Arctic regions suggest that it will be that warm in a few decades. ‘‘So we’re not saying that we’re committed yet, but we are nearing temperatures where we’ve repeatedly seen about 20 feet of sea-­level rise.’’

At some point soon, in other words, 20 feet may not be a possible outcome, but the world’s destiny. The puzzle to solve then becomes: What produces that rise in sea level? How much of the 20 feet will come from Antarctica’s ice falling into the ocean? How much from Greenland’s?

Here is one possible sequence of events: When Rignot and others point to four feet of sea-­level rise resulting from the collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites, that comes with the implication of losing, as Rignot puts it, ‘‘the back wall of West Antarctica.’’ Afterward, larger areas of West Antarctica would become vulnerable, too. And that, in turn, would lead to a more complete collapse of that part of the ice sheet, producing an additional 12 feet of sea-­level rise. The more ice you lose, the more ice you lose.

These sorts of chain reactions and feedback loops figure prominently in Rignot’s grim scenarios. Greenland’s ice sheet, meanwhile, has additional vulnerabilities. One day in Irvine, I watched him teach a class of undergraduates about another such loop, involving the color of Greenland’s ice sheet, which is growing darker as the climate warms. The darkening ice sheet absorbs more solar radiation, he said, which causes the ice sheet to melt more — and that in turn causes the ice sheet to darken more, absorb more solar radiation and melt more. ‘‘Most of the time, positive feedback is good,’’ he told the class. ‘‘If you’re a teacher, you love positive feedback. But for climate, positive feedbacks are bad.’’

The darkening of Greenland is known as the albedo-­melt feedback (albedo is Latin for ‘‘whiteness’’). There is another positive feedback in Greenland, too, known as the temperature-­elevation feedback. Simply put, at lower elevations, the temperature is warmer, and as the Greenland ice sheet melts, it gets lower in elevation. Then it melts more, and gets even lower in elevation — and so on. Alexander Robinson, a scientist at the Complutense University of Madrid, told me: ‘‘With these two feedbacks — the albedo-­melt feedback and the temperature-­elevation feedback — you’re imposing a process that won’t stop, that becomes irreversible, unless you really cool the climate in the other direction. And I think we’re getting close to temperatures where it becomes a danger that Greenland becomes auto-­sustainable, that it can just melt itself.’’ Robinson thinks we will cross the threshold within the next few decades.

Commitments are worrisome because they are hard to undo. And they are hard to undo because the waxing and waning of ice sheets is asymmetrical. It takes tens to hundreds of thousands of years to grow an ice sheet. But it may take only a few thousand or even hundreds of years to collapse it. Rignot says: ‘‘What is going to happen by 2100 with the ice sheets is, in my opinion, already locked in.’’ That could mean a sea-­level rise closer to what some climate scientists expect — perhaps a meter. Or it could mean an outcome closer to two meters. ‘‘But the world doesn’t end in 2100, either,’’ Rignot says. Then he asks: What kind of world do we want to live in, in 2100 and beyond? ‘‘Do we want to take the risk to see five, six, seven meters of sea-­level rise? Or do we want to say: No, we don’t want to go there. It’s going to be too painful?’’

In early June, a couple of months after the IceBridge flights, I passed the Jakobshavn Glacier on my way to attend a conference in the nearby village of Ilulissat about the present condition and future of the Greenland ice sheet. In the same manner that archaeologists might make a pilgrimage to Machu Picchu, glaciologists go to Jakobshavn to study its speed, ferocity and physics. Between 2000 and 2010, the glacier’s icebergs were alone responsible for about a millimeter of global sea-­level rise. Seeing the wreckage of shattered ice near the glacier’s calving front, I could understand why: From the air, it looks as if every window in the world had suddenly broken and been swept into piles here.

At the conference, I sought out an American scientist from the University of Washington named Ian Joughin. It is wise to balance Rignot’s conclusions against Joughin’s. The two men are friends, going back to their days together at the Jet Propulsion Lab in the 1990s, and both are trained as engineers, which inclines them to view ice sheets as complex physical systems rather than geological artifacts. (‘‘I can’t tell one rock from another,’’ Joughin once told me.) Moreover, on the same day last year that Rignot declared, during a news conference, the retreat of the West Antarctica glaciers to be ‘‘unstoppable,’’ Joughin and his team published a paper in Science with a similar conclusion.

Rignot, compact and athletic, can seem tensioned like a taut wire. Joughin (pronounced ‘‘JOCK-­in’’) has a genial calm about him and often dresses in a baseball cap and a fleece jacket. There are contrasts in their outlook, too. Rignot’s views on sea-­level rise qualify him as a maximalist. But Joughin’s position is more cautious. Despite his conviction that West Antarctica will eventually break down, Joughin can dismiss in a mere instant most predictions of catastrophic ice-­sheet collapse. ‘‘I would be very surprised if sea-­level rise is much more than a meter by the end of the century,’’ he told me. His view, one that seems shared by a number of his colleagues, is that his friend Rignot’s possibilities for sea-­level rise are too high: More ice would have to move into the ocean in a shorter time than is physically plausible. Or to put it another way: The world’s ice sheets are deteriorating faster than they have for thousands of years, but they’re not yet moving at a civilization-­destroying pace.

Before the conference, I emailed Joughin to ask if he would like to take a closer look with me at icebergs from Jakobshavn, and he quickly wrote back to say, ‘‘I will never turn down an opportunity to gaze upon the monster that is Jakobshavn.’’ A couple of days later, we were on a boat headed into Disko Bay. We soon began threading between battleship-­size icebergs, looming 100 feet high and 500 feet long, which had broken off Jakobshavn’s calving front 40 miles upstream.

‘‘These are probably a year or two old, and they drifted down here slowly from the calving front,’’ said Joughin, who has been researching Jakobshavn for nearly two decades. But the ice within them was probably many thousands of years old. When the iceberg had finally broken off from the end of the flowing glacier, it had most likely released an explosive power equivalent to several atomic bombs.

Every 11 days or so for the past five years, Joughin has tracked Jakobshavn’s movement — usually through radar images taken by German satellites that he views on his work computer in Seattle. Seeing the glacier’s handiwork up close was an altogether different experience, though. ‘‘Jakobshavn is the fastest glacier we know of,’’ Joughin said. Its movement has sped up by as much as a factor of four over the past few years, to the point where it recently hit a peak of 17 kilometers, or about 10.5 miles, per year. Many of Greenland’s big glaciers are also accelerating their production of icebergs as the Arctic warms, and as they do, more and more ice breaks from the ice sheet. In Jakobshavn’s prolific calving of icebergs, you not only encounter a dazzling natural tableau. You also glimpse the future of glaciers everywhere.

As we turned back to the harbor, Joughin said he imagines that Greenland’s total collapse will take many hundreds or thousands of years. He perceives various physical constraints on how much ice can get off the island at the edges, which are ringed by mountains and narrow passes through deep fjords. ‘‘The fjords are actually like nozzles on a toothpaste tube squeezing out ice,’’ he said. Joughin sees West Antarctica’s Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers taking a long time to disintegrate, too, from 200 to 900 years. ‘‘I think of collapse as being slow, like the decline of the Roman Empire,’’ he said. ‘‘If you want to be alarmist, you could say Jakobshavn is putting out huge amounts of ice — a millimeter of sea-­level rise in a decade. But if you want to be dismissive you can say: Well, there’s seven meters of ice in the Greenland ice sheet, and even with all these changes, it’s losing one millimeter per year. So that’s 7,000 years to go.’’

Almost certainly, Joughin added, the melt will speed up as the climate warms. But his larger point is that imminent disaster from rising seas is unlikely. What’s more, the ice sheets can be variable. In 2012, for instance, Greenland suffered an extraordinary melt season, resulting in the net loss of about 771 billion tons of ice. But 2013 was colder, and over all the ice sheet lost little or no ice.

It would be reassuring to learn that Joughin is more correct than Rignot. Tom Wagner, the NASA administrator for polar programs who helps fund the work of both men, as well as that of dozens of other American scientists, told me: ‘‘These are very intelligent people. A lot of them are my friends. These are people I greatly respect.’’ But no one knows what future sea levels are going to be, Wagner says. Still, that Joughin and Rignot disagree on such a crucial scientific uncertainty perhaps matters less than it seems. The difference between their views amounts to asking if the future for earth’s coastal regions will be bad or very bad. A few months ago, a researcher at Penn State named David Pollard created a computer model of the Antarctic ice sheet that showed that Thwaites could indeed collapse within a century. Although the model indicates that the process might not begin until West Antarctica is warmer than today, to Rignot it backs up his argument that society should consider what is possible, and not what is probable.

‘‘If Ian is right, and Thwaites collapses in 300 years, maybe that’s O.K.,’’ Rignot told me. ‘‘But what if David Pollard is right?’’ What if, he said, its collapse takes only a hundred years? And this, he pointed out, was only one glacier system, representing just a fraction of the meltwater that could be added to the world’s seas.

A road connects the coastal town of Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, to the edge of the central ice sheet. It rolls for 21 miles over rocky, empty, breathtaking terrain, the domain of reindeer, musk ox and arctic hares. Built around 2001 by Volkswagen to test vehicles in wintry conditions, the road dead-­ends at a cluster of large gray hills. These are glacial moraines of clay, gravel and stones that were pushed across Greenland by the relentless snowplow force of the flowing ice. Beyond the moraines, the immense ice sheet stretches north, south and east.

When approached from the ground, the ice sheet gives a first impression of an ocean — not only because it seems to capture the entire horizon, but also because it is sculpted into hillocks and hollows, like a roiling sea on a day of serious weather. On some visits, though, the ice sheet strikes you as the photographic negative of an ocean: Rather than darkness streaked with white foam, it is lightness streaked with silt and dust. The sheet in this region has been darkening noticeably over the past few years, apparently from the silt underneath and particulates in the air. In the meantime, it has been thinning and dropping in elevation, signs that feedbacks are in play. Looking ahead, you can see that as the ice recedes, the road from Kangerlussuaq will need to be extended.

You wonder if the ice will ever stop receding. If there is a concern that mobilizes Rignot above all others, it may be this. Rignot is seeking attention, something he readily admits, but it does not seem to be a case of narcissism; audacity is the best strategy for capturing the attention of a younger generation that might tackle a problem that an older generation failed to solve. He has four children, which he often says influences his longer-­term thinking. ‘‘I won’t be here in 2100 anyway,’’ he told me one day. ‘‘But I will make sure when I leave this world that my kids or the young people feel that I did as much as I could.’’

I wondered if his motivations, though, were slightly more complicated than that. In our conversations, there was a running theme, a trope, of economic havoc, of drowned cities, of time running out. The blown fuse. The idea of crossing a climate threshold now or very soon, while understanding both the physics and the folly of it, is too intellectually repugnant for him to accept quietly.

‘‘It’s probably in human nature that we’re going to react once we have our back to the wall,’’ Rignot said, ‘‘and some of the changes we project are actually seen and we can’t deny them.’’ The obvious way to avoid a grim and flooded future, he said, would be to drastically curtail our carbon-­dioxide emissions. It may be difficult to halt the most vulnerable glaciers from collapsing into the sea. But computer models of Greenland show that melting would proceed more slowly if temperature increases are minimized. A slower rise in sea levels would give coastal regions the opportunity to construct barriers to counter storm surges and give society the time to reduce the cost (and increase the scale) of clean-­energy technologies. It might even give us enough room to figure out cost-­effective ways to remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, slowing the climb in temperatures.

More ambitious schemes are being discussed, too. For instance, one University of California glaciologist, Slawek Tulaczyk, has asked whether it might be worth considering the construction of a physical barrier to protect some of Antarctica’s glaciers from warming ocean water. This is a kind of technological fix, of course, that may exceed by a large degree any engineering project ever undertaken. Then again, to see the ice sheets up close is to see that our predicament is not how much is melting now, but how much is destined to melt. That was the feeling I got watching from the cockpit on the IceBridge flights, as we flew for hours over Greenland’s blank expanses. It is something Rignot realized, too, during his first glimpse of the Pine Island glacier in Antarctica: ‘‘I flew across the front, and I was thinking, I knew this was big, but I can’t believe how long it takes at 400 knots to cross the glacier. You are there for 10 full minutes.’’

Walking for a few hours last summer on the ice sheet near Kangerlussuaq, its crystals crunching underfoot, I got the impression that I could walk forever without reaching the other side. A slightly discernible incline, where the ice sheet rises to higher elevations, was barely perceivable in the distance. At the same time, by bending down near a small creek, carved into translucent white ice by a rushing stream, I could cup my hands and drink meltwater from snow that fell thousands of years ago, water as cold and pure as any that exists in nature. All around on the ice sheet were pools and rivulets, too many to count — each of them an omen of the larger melt to come.",REAL
Choose Your Own Adventure: A Conversation With Jennifer Egan and George Saunders,"But I took a long time to write “Look at Me,” and some of what I imagined as wacky hypotheticals — for example, a type of self-branding reality-TV-ish website I called Ordinary People — had already started to come true by the time I published it. I learned you have to move fast, writing futuristic satire in America: Before you know it, you’re a realist!

Saunders: What about “A Visit From the Goon Squad,” which starts as what we feel is a “realist” text, in our time – and then takes that leap forward into the future? Was that your intention from the outset?

Egan: Not at all! I was basically thrust into the future under protest, by my timeline and the organizing principle of the book, which was to follow characters, laterally, into their lives at different points. I wanted to pursue this character named Alex into middle age and see what he was like then. But he’s in his early 20s in around 2006, in the first chapter of the book. So that made things very difficult for me, because by the time he’s middle-aged, I’m into the future. I thought, Well, O.K., maybe it’s not 2006 when he’s in his 20s, maybe it’s much earlier, maybe the entire timeline of the book could be moved back. But after a couple of minutes of thinking about that, I realized it wouldn’t work at all, especially musically, because I wanted to write about punk rock. And I would have been back with Elvis, practically, just to get Alex into his 40s in 2009. It just was impossible. I had to go forward.

Saunders: I think that’s one of the pleasures of that move into the future: The reader feels that it comes out of an organic, narrative need that your story has created. This sort of thing happened with my story “Escape From Spiderhead.” I had written a first few pages purposely running at about 70 percent articulateness. I was trying to do a kind of slightly dumbed-down voice. I can’t really even remember why. I just had some text where the guy was sort of a fumbler. But I’d done voices like that in a few previous stories and was getting tired of it, and felt like goofing around in a higher verbal register. So I wrote some prose that was, you know, almost like Henry James on stupid pills, but it was the best I could do. So then I had that text sitting alongside some of that 70 percent text. And thought, How might I get those two modes of expression into the same story? Just, mechanically, how can I justify having those two first-person monologues attributed to the same character? And I thought: Oh, a drug. And whatever that drug was, it had to allow his diction to go from this to that — from low to high — to express what he’s perceiving with more precision, and in a better vocabulary. And then this name popped into my head: Verbaluce™.

Egan: How can I get a prescription? When I think about a book like “A Clockwork Orange,” which I really loved, the weird hybrid language is what I remember most. And even though I don’t start with language like you do, I’m happy if I can somehow get to different language when I imagine forward. In a way, that was what writing a chapter in PowerPoint did for me in “Goon Squad.” I had been dying to use PowerPoint as a genre for fiction, but I found that using it in any present-day story felt completely lame: static and mannered and corporate, but it felt strange and interesting, like a different language, when I was telling a future story. Was “A Clockwork Orange” an important book for you?

Saunders: It was. I found it thrilling because it seemed that, as Anthony Burgess focused his attention on inventing a new language, that process was simultaneously creating a new world. It felt like language and world were sort of co-creating each other.

I’ve always had, since I was a little kid first starting to read, an aversion to language that felt flat, or too “normal.” I remember having that response to some of our reading books: “David, a kindly stout boy, walked up his street, past trees and houses.” And I just felt like, first, “Kill me,” and second, “That is a lie.” That flat language is not doing justice to reality. I just have no interest in writing in a style that complies too closely with what I’ve heard called “consensus reality.” This is maybe a bit of a neurosis of mine. So as you try through revision to depart from that flatness, what you’re really doing, ritually, is destabilizing your lazy habitual perceptions.

If you write (God forbid): “Jim, a successful insurance executive, walked into the Holiday Inn lobby in a happy, cheerful spirit,” and read what you’ve written, and almost throw up, well, what you’ll want to do in revision is purge the prose of whatever it was that sickened you: “Jim (happy, cheerful Jim) once again dragged himself into the freaking Holiday Inn.” So now Jim’s happy cheerfulness reads as something he’s tired of, and faking. Which is, to my ear, at least, a little better. And if you feel, as I would, an aversion to now having to laboriously try to describe a Holiday Inn, you might shake things up by invention: As in: “Jim (happy, cheerful Jim) once again dragged his tired, divorced ass into the freaking Macomb, Ill., Holiday Inn, MindGetting (out of sheer boredom) ‘April 1, 1865/this geog/pretty girl,’ and then, thankfully (for the 10-second window allowed by his ‘Premier TimeTravel’ pass), was transformed into Maggie O’Doole, who stood looking down at her hoop skirt, then up at the lobby, which now was a Midwestern meadow, one lone hawk circling overhead.”

What the hell does all of that (which just now came out in a spontaneous language lurch, away from banality) even mean? Well, it would appear that Jim has a computer in his head, and that he “MindGets” (a verb, seems like) a subroutine designed to transform him into a PRETTY GIRL, on APRIL 1, 1865, in THIS GEOGRAPHY (i.e., the meadow in which the Holiday Inn now stands). This is what I heard a young writer recently describe as “revising via contempt.” My unhappiness with what I’d written led to that lurch, which led to: the future, or something that sounds as if it’s meant to be the future.

Egan: I think form has worked that way for me — as a bridge into a different world that can comfortably and naturally contain it. It happened with Twitter. I’d been interested for a long time in using it to write fiction — not so much because of the small structural units, which Twitter obviously didn’t invent, but the sense of these utterances appearing digitally one after another from some distant place. I kept thinking, what kind of story would need to be told that way? How can it not just feel like a conventional story broken down and delivered sequentially?

This is how I came to write “Black Box.” An atmosphere began to come to me: somewhere on the Mediterranean, with all its mythic echoes. A woman spying in that region. The idea of the spy being Lulu, a character from “Goon Squad.” And then the notion that she’s not telling the story directly, as in, “I did this, I did that,” but instead she’s just listing the lessons she takes away from each thing that happens. “I pretended to hear a noise” becomes “Having heard something inaudible to others puts you in an immediate position of authority.” So I ended up with this very indirect form of narration that makes sense as a series of discrete dispatches — as tweets. If I’d tried to write it conventionally, it would have been kind of cheesy James Bond, really familiar stuff. The structural weirdness was the essential element, the way in.

Saunders: In “Black Box” I love the idea of the androidish spy paraphernalia. Where did that idea come from?

Egan: Well, I had this female spy posing as a beauty. And I wanted her to be able to record things by camera and audio. And I knew that there was no way she could carry equipment because she was mostly just in a bikini or whatever, that just wasn’t feasible. And because I was writing about a character from “A Visit From the Goon Squad,” who could only be in her 30s if the story was happening in the 2030s, I knew I was in the future. That turned out to be very convenient, but I didn’t actually think of inserting any “futuristic” innovations until the moment I’m wondering, Oh, my God, how can she spy if she can’t carry any equipment? Oh wait, I get it, the equipment is inside her!

Saunders: I also love the way that, in that situation, your mind ran forward in the same way that the mind of the (eventual, forthcoming) inventor of that thing will; something like: “God, it’s such a pain to carry a tape recorder around — can’t we just install it in the body?” Your mind, your human creativity, created a need and a way of satisfying that need, in the same way the eventual inventors of those things will. So maybe that’s part of what writers do in this futurist mode: They model certain logically nascent eventualities.

Egan: When I was 18, I went to Europe alone with a backpack. And if I wanted to call home in San Francisco, I would wait in line at one of those international call centers, get to a phone, make the call, and the best case scenario was that someone would answer. But you know, just as often, it would either ring and ring and ring, or there’d be a busy signal. It wasn’t until I was in college that the answering machine came along. From the time I was born until then, I witnessed all of one telecommunications development. What’s happened since, we all know.

So my experience of that trajectory — from the phone ringing and ringing to the kind of hyperenmeshment that’s possible now and will ultimately be the norm — that feels like a story I need to tell. It’s also an essential factor in a lot of other stories of our time, like the rise of modern terrorism, and globalization. And it raises the question that’s probably obsessed me more than any other, starting with my first novel, “The Invisible Circus”: how does image culture reach into our inner lives? Does it change who we are to ourselves? That was explicitly on my mind with “Look at Me.” And I guess what I’ve found, more and more, is that it’s hard to ask questions like that without also imagining forward, because everything is moving so fast. The present is already the past, technologically. I know that now.

Saunders: One topic I’d like to someday take on in a work of “futuristic” fiction is our increasing materialism — we are coming to believe that our minds are entirely sufficient to understand the universe in its entirety. This means a shrinking respect for mystery — religion vanishing as a meaningful part of our lives (or being used, in its fundamentalist forms, to beat back mystery, rather than engage it); an increasing acceptance that if something is “effective” (profitable, stockholder-enhancing), then that answers all questions of its morality. This insistence on the literal and provable and data-based and pragmatic leaves us, I think, only partly human. What will the future look like, given that premise? Bleak, I’d say. But interesting.

I’m actually working on a novel based in the past now, and to me, there are some parallels between writing about the future and writing about the past. Neither interests me at all, if the intention is just to “get it right.” It’s nearly impossible to recreate a past mind-set, and also, why bother? That mind-set already existed, if you see what I mean. The goal of a work of fiction is, in my view, to say something, about how life is for us, not at any particular historical moment (past or present or future) but at every single moment. By necessity, we have to choose some precise time to depict, but we wouldn’t want to confuse ourselves by thinking that the “correct depiction” of that time was the goal.

Egan: I’m curious what period are you writing about, and what led you to do that?

Saunders: Yeah, I’m going to be a little secretive about it, as sort of a mojo-protection move. ... but it’s the 19th century. And the motivation for doing it was just this really cool, sad story I heard around 1998 For years, I was playing with that idea in different modes and screwing it up, and then one day I had a little insight into how I might do it. It’s also got a supernatural element. So, weirdly, although it’s ostensibly “historical,” it actually feels more like a sci-fi story than anything I’ve ever done before. There’s a heavy element of world-building — figuring out the internal rules of the place and so on.

Egan: It sounds kind of steampunk — in a good way. I’m also working on a novel that takes place in the past. But what I’m doing is much closer to home, the 1930s and ’40s. One thing I’ve found tricky about the ’30s and ’40s is knowing what the past looked and felt like at that time. Because that’s so much of what the present is. What do people miss? What feels new to them? When someone seems old-fashioned, what does that mean? What time are they harking back to? This element of knowing the past is obviously easier if you’re writing forward, because their past, or part of it, would be our present. Writing about the past, I don’t have that luxury; I’m just heading further into the past, and further away from what I know. Even though I don’t write autobiographically, moving outside of my lifetime makes it much harder to connect to the atmosphere I really need to be able to do anything. And a lot of that atmosphere, the textures that make up a moment, have to do with what came before it. So the research has been way beyond what I envisioned.

Saunders: That period seems like it might actually be harder than the 19th century, because we have a better idea of how they actually talked in 1932, from movies and so on.

Egan: Yes and no. There’s something wonderfully artificial about movies and newscasts from that time, those tight, quasi-English accents everyone seemed to have. I can’t imagine people actually talked that way. So there’s a fair amount of leeway. What I think about most is probably just avoiding jargon and metaphors that draw on contemporary experience or usage. I go nuts when I read, in something set in the past, “It’s not about this, it’s about that ... ,” when honestly, I never heard the phrase “It’s about” until after 1990.

Photo

Saunders: With the 19th century, you can say, “Yeah, well, we have no idea how they actually talked.” I read this really interesting thing online, when I was trying to figure out how (or if) people in the 19th century swore — and it was basically that all the words we have, they had. And they had a few we don’t use anymore. The only reason we know this (the texts of that day having been pretty heavily censored and controlled) is that judges insisted that the court records be verbatim — and yes, people swore.

I found that the only way I could approach writing something in the 19th century was to give myself a sort of free pass on accuracy. So I think I’m really just appearing to pretend to do a time-specific diction. Basically riffing on what we, now, acknowledge to be “19th-century diction.” I mean, I read a lot of stuff from the period and let it sort of seep into me — but what relation “my” 19th-century diction has with the actual is very unclear. And anyway, what I’ve noticed is that whether I’m doing the future or the past, I’m doing a kind of “nudge-nudge wink-wink” with the reader, like: “O.K., we’re in the future. Right? But not really. I’m going to pretend to be writing about the past (or the future), and we’re going to enjoy the fact that I’m not really doing it assiduously.” Because the real goal is not precise depiction, but using the apparent effort of precise depiction as a source of context and fun.

Egan: In writing my new book, I presumed there would be a tricky connection to the present that might take the form of leaps into it, or winks, as you say — some sort of bargain between narrator and reader that was more complicated than We Are Now in the Past. But the book has resisted that kind of narrative interference absolutely. It was a nonstarter every time I tried it. Only a kind of straightforward, immersive narration seemed to work. I thought, But that’s not what I do anymore! I’ve always been willing to try anything, and it turns out the book had very different ideas about how it needed to be written than I was expecting. And it also turns out that for me, verisimilitude is actually harder than formal trickiness.

Of course, there’s no way to write a book set in the recent past without both reader and writing being keenly aware of what comes next, and I think the book is saturated with that awareness, but I had to find much subtler ways of acknowledging it and using it than I had imagined. And writing somewhat straightforwardly about the past has meant letting go of my obsession with media culture — the topic that led me to look for new forms in the first place. Maybe technology had become a hobbyhorse without my knowing it. Now that I’ve been forced into a different mode, I realize that I’m actually pretty sick of writing in tricky ways about image culture. So the new novel has become a delivery out of that, at least for now.

To me your new novel sounds kind of Gothic. That’s another literary realm with a long history, back to the 18th century. One futuristic novel that had a huge impact on me was Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” which is kind of science fiction plus Gothic. So those genres share a root. I wrote a Gothic novel called “The Keep,” and working in the Gothic was freeing in some of the same ways we’ve talked about with the future. I could have a murderous, 100-year-old baroness who seduces a young male visitor in her castle, then leaves a trail of ashes behind in the bed. Hard to do that with verisimilitude.

Saunders: Yes, that almost never happens to me anymore. But wow, back in the ’70s. ...

Egan: Adam Begley, an author and book reviewer, referred to your stories as “post-real,” which I really like. I take it to mean that you’re depicting worlds where “reality” is not as we conventionally define it. You talked about language being your bridge into the future; what kind of bridge leads you into the post-real? Is it language too, or something else?

Saunders: When I’m writing, I like to just allow myself one exaggerated or impossible element. So in something like “The Semplica-Girl Diaries,” the only unreal thing is the fact of the existence of these “Semplica-Girls” — which are these living lawn elements: third-world women being paid to hang on a wire in one’s yard. Other than that, it’s our world. Therefore, whatever energy comes off the story is about our world. It’s like, if you dropped into a family on some unusual day (someone has died, or won an Oscar) — that’s a great chance to learn something new about the essence of that family, that might not be as visible on a normal day. This is the Kafka model, I think: other than the fact that Samsa wakes up as a bug, “The Metamorphosis” is running on fairly realist energy. That Prague works about the same as the real Prague of that time, except: guy turns into a bug.

Egan: Another novel that’s post-real without being futuristic, exactly, is Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man.” His protagonist exists in a kind of expressionistic solitude that feels like an exaggerated version of the world many of us would recognize, with its racism and inequalities. The novel has a slightly skewed relationship to the real world, which first of all gives Ellison much more freedom, allows the book to be strange in ways that it would not be if he were shackled by verisimilitude. It pushes it into the realm of myth or archetype, or maybe even cartoon in moments. It’s the same way with the most powerful futuristic books — for me they’ve always been the ones where elements of the present day are sculpted into exaggerated forms: men dominating women in Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale,” or Cold War anxiety in “A Wrinkle in Time” and “1984.”

Saunders: Yes — and those books, especially the Ellison, seem to oppose the normative by refusing to play by “realist” rules — which can sometimes serve as reactionary tools.

This Russian writer Mikhail Zoshchenko wrote, “Man is excellently made and eagerly lives the kind of life that is being lived.” I love the idea that there’s this thing we might call human tendency, and it’s like a big blanket that gets draped over whatever conditions a given time period has produced. So you know, the Spanish Inquisition comes along, and human tendency gets draped over that historical reality, and “being human” lays out in a certain way. Or it’s 1840, and you’re living in Iceland, and human tendency drapes itself over whatever is going on there and — “being human” looks another way. Same blanket, different manifestation. The Internet shows up, and social media and so on, and the blanket of our human tendency gets draped over all of that, and “being human” looks yet another way.

Likewise, if we drape that tendency blanket over some imagined future time where everybody’s 80 percent prosthetic, it’s still the same blanket. So the writer’s ultimate concentration should be on the blanket, not on what’s underneath it. What writing can do uniquely, I think, is show us fundamental human tendencies, and the ways these tendencies lead to suffering — Faulkner’s good old “human heart in conflict with itself” idea. That’s what we’re really interested in, I think, and why we turn to literature.",REAL
The Cult of the ‘Amateur’,"Photo

Late in October, the retired brain surgeon Ben Carson took the stage at a Christian college in Colorado and pitched himself as president. ‘‘I love it when people come up to me and they say: ‘B-b-b-b-but-but you’ve never been elected to any public office! You can’t possibly know how to do anything!’ Well, let me tell you something. The ark was built by amateurs. The Titanic was built by professionals.’’ Carson touched his fingertips together and smiled softly to himself. The crowd went nuts. Outside, one Carson supporter pinpointed the surgeon’s appeal: ‘‘People are sick of politicians.’’

Ever since the Tennessee militiaman Andrew Jackson bushwhacked his way to Washington to unseat the son-of-a-president John Quincy Adams in 1828, the outsider path to the presidency has been trod by an Ohio newspaper publisher, a Missouri haberdasher, a Georgia peanut farmer, a California movie star and a Texas oilman. But even these variety-pack presidents made pit stops as senators, governors, cabinet secretaries, military generals or V.P.s before banging on the Oval Office door. Ben Carson operated on babies’ brains and sold his bootstrappy life story in a series of motivational books, details of which have been called into question. Heading into November, he sat atop the Republican presidential polls. Close behind was Donald Trump, the real estate tycoon who starred in a reality show that glamorized firing people and called some Mexican immigrants ‘‘rapists’’ in his campaign announcement. Pundits have branded this political moment ‘‘amateur hour,’’ a term that now registers as an insult. But it has an older meaning, one that betrays America’s sincere enthusiasm for the utterly unprofessional.

‘‘The Original Amateur Hour’’ was America’s first televised variety competition, and from 1948 to 1970, it broadcast the hidden talents of American workers — the juggling machine operator, the housewives’ kitchen band. Viewers at home played armchair critics, voting by phone or postcard to determine which acts returned for the next episode. Reviewing a DVD retrospective of ‘‘Amateur Hour’’ in The New York Times in 2006, the writer Claire Dederer watched a contestant blow smoke out of the back of his jacket while making train sounds on a harmonica but found herself transfixed by his face: He ‘‘actually looks happy,’’ she wrote. ‘‘Not pretend happy, like the ambitious souls on ‘American Idol,’ but truly happy, the way a person looks when he knows he’s onto something really great.’’

Since 1990, most Americans have told Gallup that we get our sense of purpose through our work, but in recent years we also say that we hate our jobs, which must mean on some level that we hate ourselves. Amateurs get their name from the Latin amator, or ‘‘lover,’’ and we turn to them to model a type of work freed from the constraints of the workplace. Win or lose, Ohio State’s football players end their games by rushing to the end zone, joining arms and belting the school’s alma mater with the crowd. We click through videos of supposedly amateur porn performers and feel safe in the fantasy that they’re really getting off. We suspect that traditional politicians have been squeezed by special interests, filtered through focus groups and massaged by advisers before being cleared to approach the podium, whereas the amateurs saunter up to the stage and express who they really are.

The idea of effortless authenticity is so attractive that members of the American establishment have vied for more than a century to buy, cheat or counterfeit their way to amateur status. In 1732, Poor Richard’s Almanack circulated the Colonies as the work of ‘‘Poor’’ Richard Saunders, an amateur collector of factoids who dispensed common-sensical values and homespun wisdom. Runaway sales of the almanac series eventually turned its true publisher, Ben Franklin, into one of the Colonies’ wealthiest men. Decades later, dabbling in diplomacy during the Revolutionary War, he sailed to France and pulled the trick on a new audience: The 70-year-old Bostonian fashioned himself as a folksy frontiersman, pulling a weasel-pelt cap over his ringlets and charming the French into opening their purses for the rebel cause.",REAL
David Brat Thinks Congress Is Plenty Smart,"Don’t Calvinists tend to take a rather dim view of human nature? Almost every great thinker in the Western tradition has agreed with that claim except for Rousseau and Marx, but they’re not on my team. On the other hand, even with a dim view of human nature, I am commanded every day to love every single child of God from morning to night.

So you take a dim view but love them anyway? No. One is an empirical assessment of human nature, the other is how I’m commanded to treat my neighbor.

You have said that bankers should have gone to jail during the 2008 financial crisis. Because of that, you have been called the Elizabeth Warren of the right. Do you think that’s a good comparison? Uh, I doubt it.

We promised the American people a whole host of items: not raising the debt ceiling, lowering taxes, getting rid of Obamacare, reducing deficits, strengthening the military, etc. Right now some folks are saying that the Freedom Caucus is unrealistic.

What do you think you’ve learned in Washington? It’s hard. I like Plato’s maxim to start politics at 50 because you’re near death and the appetites are — whatever. You’re past the wine, women and song. I came up here wanting to follow my principles, and I thought that the press would help me to explain my principles to people. But they haven’t.

I do want to reflect your principles accurately. It sounds as if you don’t see people as neatly divided into conservatives and liberals as the press does. If there is one thing that unites both parties up here, it’s money. My principle that cuts across all of that is representing the will of the people. And I’m called a hard-right conservative for some reason for being with Adam Smith, a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher. Is he hard right?

People might say that you shouldn’t just take Smith’s principles and deposit them directly into our day without paying any attention to what we may have learned in the interim.

Letter of Recommendation: The ‘Death in … ’ Books,"Photo

This summer, two female bears, each with a set of twin cubs, took up residence along a tree-lined trail in Denver. Hikers in the park had proved themselves prone to snapping selfies with bears, sometimes by creeping within 10 feet of them, so in response, the city pre-emptively shut down the trail. This story circulated online as evidence of human stupidity’s direct correlation with modern technol­ogy’s advancement, but I thought that was unfair. People have been making mistakes in nature for a long, long time.

For years, I’ve been an avid reader of what I call the “Death in … ” books. It’s not quite an actual series — there are four so far, from three different publishers — but the “Death in … ” books all do the same thing: They chronicle accidents, murders and mishaps in several of America’s most treasured national parks, giving us “Death in Yellowstone,” “Death in Yosemite,” “Death in the Grand Canyon” and “Death in Big Bend.” The Yellowstone, Yo­semi­te and Grand Canyon books purport to chronicle every single death (excluding illness and car accidents) from the mid-19th century onward, sorted into chapters by type: flash floods, bear maulings, murder, falls, poison gas and so on. “Death in Big Bend” is a bit of an outlier, acting more like a highlight reel.

The “Death in … ” books are more than just macabre litanies. They also provide remarkable statistics (at least 88 people were bitten by bears in Yellowstone in September 1924), technical details of body-recovery missions and, through the evolving modes of death, an oblique capsule history of the American West. Over the years, deaths from clashes with Native Americans give way to deaths from dehydration suffered by lost, hallucinating hippies. All the while, human nature remains constant: People (particularly, it must be said, young male people) walk too close to the edge — often literally.

Several of the books’ authors try to head off accusations of morbidity by claiming to be educational. The stories aren’t prurient; they’re instructive. The authors of “Death in the Grand Canyon” loftily claim, “It would be lethal not to have written this book.” In their defense, there are indeed lessons to be learned from other people’s tragedies: Don’t pitch your tent at the edge of a cliff if you plan on getting drunk; don’t try to befriend the buffalo. Still, no one buys a book with a skull on the cover because they’re hoping for edification.

From “Death in Yellowstone,” on the fate of Wilfred Karls, 20, who drowned in the Old Faithful swimming pool in 1937: “Unable to swim, Karls was hanging onto the side of the pool, and his subsequent shouts for help were misinterpreted by others as being part of a water polo game in progress.”

I was a death-obsessed teenager, and I would have loved these books then — sulking in the back seat of the family car during a national park vacation, reading choice horror stories out loud to everyone else’s dismay — but I came to them as an adult, picking up “Death in Big Bend” from a gift shop in that very park. I started reading it at the campsite and quickly became insufferable. I gasped and yelped; I felt physically compelled to read certain sentences out loud.

The books are satisfying in the same way that other accounts of peril in the wilderness are. But while most of those adventure stories center on crampon- wearing superhumans, the “Death in …” books feature characters with more familiar foibles. They get so excited when they catch a fish that they stand up in the boat. They try to impress their girlfriends. They slip on the ice. They want a closer look at the waterfall. They think the storm doesn’t look that bad.",REAL
Perfect and Unrehearsed,"Cartier-Bresson’s oeuvre, his reportorial as well as aesthetic achievements, laid the ground for future photojournalists. Maggie Steber, for instance, credits him with giving her a way to think about style, content and construction. But then, as any mature artist must, she moved into her own visual language. In her photograph of a funeral in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in 1987, an exqui­sitely balanced composition is further strengthened by the judicious color: light blue, dark blue and brown. The main mourner’s gesture, his powerful arms outstretched, echoes that of the figure of Christ on the cross behind him.

Photo

The picture’s structure is sustained by intersecting lines. The man’s head and left arm form a diagonal; a rectangle set off from this diagonal would contain the main action of the photograph. In the background are other crosses. Even the streetlamp is a half-finished cross. These crosses are like individual instruments taking up a musical theme. A roof at the left emphasizes the main diagonal and a glance from the second most prominent man in the picture, which parallels it. The pale-shirted shoulders from which the dark-suited mourner emerges form a radiating arrangement, and the bent elbows to the left and right are like parentheses around this group of helpers.

Beginning photographers are often tempted to reduce photography to rigid rules. The rule of thirds — thinking of the picture plane in terms of a grid made of three equal vertical and three equal horizontal divisions, with the points of interest placed at the intersections of these lines — is a common starting point. More sophisticated is the golden ratio (two quantities are said to be in a golden ratio if the ratio of the larger to the smaller is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger). Imagine a triptych in which the center is about 0.618 as wide as each of the wings. Because this ratio is often found in nature, it is credited as the mathematical logic behind many efficient and visually pleasing phenomena: certain flower petals, or mollusk shells, or spiral galaxies. These codes can be helpful for looking. But the reality is that there is usually a much more improvisatory and flexible mathematical order at play in a successful photograph.

A bright afternoon in 1986. Alex Webb is on the streets of Bombardopolis, a town in northwestern Haiti. That afternoon is long gone now, but a photograph Webb made that day remains. A woman stands in a blue frock and a red head scarf. An enormous cigarette floating next to her face turns out to be in the mouth of a man in deep shadow in the foreground. In the middle distance are a donkey’s ears, and little else of the donkey. Farther back is a boy, neatly contained in the frame created by a bamboo pole on one side and a painted wall on the other. He is in silhouette, and he appears to be looking at the photographer (and therefore at us, who share the photographer’s view). There are other people in the picture: a man in profile on the left; another little boy, only his head visible, peeking just below the silhouetted boy; a woman in a patterned red-and-blue cloth standing in a doorway with her back to us. The plaster has flaked off the wall on the right to reveal a shape as pointed and angular as the donkey’s ears.

In Steber’s picture of the funeral, there is a miraculous unity of action. She described to me how it came about: ‘‘Like an orchestra playing a dramatic symphony, everything crescendoed at the same time. The dead woman’s son, without warning, suddenly rose up in anguish in the painful last cry of a son saying goodbye forever to his mother, and just as the last rays of sun fell on his face.’’ The opposite is true in Webb’s picture. There is no dramatic highlight; no one interacts with or even looks at anyone else. The only communicative glance is from the two boys, outward, toward us. And yet the anomie of an afternoon in the 1980s in a small, hot Haitian town is given, in this photograph, uncanny, indelible and exact form.

Photo

Webb’s is perhaps not a picture Cartier-Bresson would have liked very much, as he was skeptical of color and strong shadows. But for Webb, everything is fair game: color, shadows, a silhouette, a rock, a wall, a cigarette, a donkey’s ears, a saddle, a signboard, a hand here, a head there. Despite this freedom, everything is in its right place. Notice the repetition of an elongated rectangle: the door, the doorway, the vertical sections of wall, the lower edge of the window. Then there are the implied polygons around key figures: the silhouetted boy, the woman in the red scarf, the donkey’s ears. The same elongated rectangle, or at least one related to it by ratio, appears in various sizes and in various disguises in free geometric play throughout the picture plane.

The success of certain pictures — pictures that make the viewer say, ‘‘Damn it,’’ and wonder how such things are possible — comes from a combination of tutored intuition and good luck. Could Munkacsi, Cartier-Bresson, Steber or Webb have considered some matters of pictorial complexity at the moment they made their pictures? No question about it. But could they have seen every element at the moment they pressed the shutter? Impossible. The photographer has to be there to begin with, tuned in and tuned up, active, asking a family for permission to attend a funeral in Port-au-Prince, following a man and a donkey down the road in Bombardopolis. The rest is fate.",REAL
Should I Tell My Friend’s Husband That She’s Having an Affair?,"What should I do? If I continue to be friends with Jane and Peter, I end up in some small way lying to Peter, who is also a friend. But I am not going to tell Peter about the affair — that’s not my role. If I distance myself from them, I feel like I’m just taking the ethical path that ‘‘keeps my hands clean’’ but doesn’t do anything positive. What use is that?

And probably the strangest thing is, deep inside, I think the affair may be good for everyone. Jane and Peter have a good marriage, and Jane needs this outlet with Martin. Maybe just allowing the lie to roll forward in perpetuity is the best thing.

But I sometimes conjure the following: Peter finds out after many years, his marriage is destroyed, he is deeply hurt and he says to me: “You knew about this the whole time? You helped her lie to me about this for years?” I don’t know what I would say. Name Withheld

Quirky intellectuals. Marital betrayal. You seem to have wandered into an Iris Murdoch novel. Let’s see if the plot can be untangled.

First, it does matter that you’re a man. What you owe people depends, in part, on what they’re entitled to expect, and this depends on social understandings about different kinds of relationships. Your connection with Peter, as you describe it, doesn’t seem to involve much intimacy. He probably wouldn’t expect you to share secrets with him. Still, not sharing intimate details is one thing: not telling him his wife is cheating is another. It’s a betrayal of your relationship with him, and abetting her deception looks like an even more substantial betrayal.

But telling Peter about what she’s been doing would be the betrayal of another relationship, yours with Jane. It’s a bond of longer standing and of greater closeness. So you’ve been faced with a choice of two betrayals. And, in the rock-paper-scissors of these relationships, the loyalty owed her trumps the loyalty owed him.

You can also try to take into account the consequences of exposing Jane’s secret. The dishonesty would come to an end, sure. But you’re convinced that the marriage, which you consider a good one, would come to an end, too. And because Jane and Martin can’t get together, you might think that no one would be better off. The expected outcome, alongside the nature of your bond with Jane, weighs in favor of your decision to maintain your silence.

That’s not quite the end of the matter, though. What you don’t know can hurt you. Peter’s marriage may seem great to him, but there’s something seriously wrong with it. Jane is engaging in adultery. So she’s not only lying to him but also betraying their commitments to each other, commitments that the public institution of marriage dignifies and aims to help sustain. At the same time, your keeping him in the dark is — insofar as you’re taking his interests into consideration — paternalistic and thus disrespectful. She’s also drawing you into her web of deceit in ways you’re entitled to resent. (You can at least be honest with Jane about that — about your discomfort with the pretense.) And then you’ve got to wonder whether a life of continual deception isn’t exacting a toll on her too. Yet, as you say, ending your friendship with her fixes nothing.

Of course, all this assumes you’re reading the situation correctly: Nobody really knows what’s going on in anybody else’s marriage. Conceivably, after weathering the revelation, Jane and Peter might forge a truer, purer bond, with the added strength of a healed fracture. (Not that I’d take this bet.) Maybe Peter already realizes or suspects something is wrong.

But if your assessment is accurate, you are in a deeply compromised moral situation — one in which the cure is worse than the condition. As is so often the case, there’s no way out from under the net. It’s a distressing bind. Moral narcissism is about being more concerned with the cleanliness of your hands than with how your conduct shapes the lives around you. Your sensitivity to this pitfall is commendable. So is the fact that what you’re doing — though the least bad option — bothers you. Life is messy, and the best outcome often has something deplorable about it. I suppose it’s all in the title of the great Bronzino painting that one of Iris Murdoch’s characters found so captivating: ‘‘Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time.’’ If the day comes when Peter asks you why you helped Jane conceal her betrayal, you can tell him the truth. He won’t forgive. But he just may understand.",REAL
The Taste of Serendipity,"Photo

‘‘Genius,’’ E.B. White wrote, ‘‘is more often found in a cracked pot than in a whole one.’’ Judging by how many of my possessions are chipped, broken, worn, bowed and burned, it’s apparent I’ve invested in his odds. It’s not a popular attitude — certainly not in cookbooks, where kitchens often seem embodiments of sunny, enameled perfection — but I hold to it. I was particularly glad recently to open the cookbook ‘‘This Is Camino,’’ by Russell Moore and Allison Hopelain, the owners of the Oakland restaurant Camino, and find in its pages a catechism for my crackpot ways.

‘‘Until now,’’ the introduction explains, ‘‘we’ve had nothing written down, even dishes we make repeatedly,’’ because ‘‘on some level, every meal here needs to feel like it’s being made for the first time.’’ The reason is that keeping formulas away ‘‘wards off a certain rigidity that can creep into a kitchen.’’

I stopped there at first, and relished the surprise of it: perfect replication seen not as a measure of success but as an invasive pest, to be beaten back. Then I read the book thoroughly. And I found that a key to cooking the way they do at Camino — to making dishes you might eat at their tables — is an embrace of the defects and deficiencies that abound by sheer serendipity in home kitchens, unless they are warded off by mistake.

Photo

The first thing to be embraced is the likelihood of the unexpected. Normally, cookbooks in which restaurants tell their secrets are full of advice for averting crises, guarding against error, making dishes fail-safe. But here you find courtship of the unpredictable, and ebullient descriptions of the pleasures that come from facing the strange and unknown. Every other week at Camino, a whole pig arrives, without anyone knowing its size, which can vary ‘‘up to a hundred pounds.’’ Neighbors deliver herbs ‘‘randomly, and in unplanned quantities.’’ Moore buys only fish caught nearby, not purely for ecological reasons but also for the pleasure of navigating the constraint: ‘‘Life’s just more fun that way.’’

The next truth to welcome is that responsibly grown food will be remarkably expensive unless you can make each part of each ingredient sing for its soup. Because Camino tries to ‘‘use up the seemingly unusable parts of vegetables in order to get the most out of them,’’ it is hard to make any one recipe in the cookbook without also making some of another. At the bottom of a recipe for Pounded Herb Sauce on Page 14, there is this: ‘‘Note: The herb stems can be used to make Egg Tea (see Page 164).’’ A few pages later, a recipe for a vivid scarlet beet soup (included here) calls for the liquid saved from the ends of batches of sauerkraut. There is a recipe for mashed beets, one for carrot salad, another for grilled chicories and then an herb-jam recipe that includes ‘‘beet tops,’’ ‘‘carrot tops’’ and ‘‘outer chicory leaves.’’ Egg yolks become ice cream, egg whites become meringues and eggshells are saved and filled with confetti for New Year’s. ‘‘Nothing is wasted,’’ notes Chris Colin, a co-writer of the book. ‘‘Orange peels are gold. Yogurt containers are Tupperware. Broken pots aren’t discarded but used to hold fire tools.’’",REAL

Unless you wrote this letter in 1999, your friends do not need to see another photo of you both. They’ve seen hundreds, as the creepy vanity of the holiday photo has become a year-round festival. However, if she is actually sending paper cards out while you drink eggnog all day, she has the right to observe the tradition as she sees fit. Maybe she can include a photo of herself holding a photo of you that she took while you were sleeping. That’s probably the best representation of where your relationship stands today anyway.",REAL
Roughing It Like a ‘Real Vermonter’,"The next day my husband peeked under the bandage. Kit said, “How is it?”

“I think it’s healing nicely,” he said.

“It’s still bleeding,” I said, noticing the red on the bandage. “Are you sure you didn’t need stitches?” Then my husband looked at Kit.

“Should we tell her?” he said.

“Tell me what?”

“I didn’t cut it sharpening a blade, I cut it in the wood splitter.”

“What?” I said. “You should have seen a doctor!”

“This is why I didn’t tell you,” he said. “We did fine. There was a lot of blood. But we got the job done. Kit held the skin taut while I pierced it, then she pulled the needle through.” I shook my head. “You could have just gone to the doctor,” I said.

A few weeks passed. The finger increased in size three times; even his hand and arm became swollen. One day he noticed that the finger was off kilter, so he got out his X-ray machine and took a picture of it. He saw that he had sliced through the bone.

I made him go to a hand surgeon. She was amazed that he didn’t have sepsis. She said she would try to save the finger. I told her how he didn’t want to go to a doctor. She told me it was all right, that my husband was a real Vermonter and that hers was, too. She said that one day her husband was chain-sawing and cut his leg right through his jeans. He had a gash, but he didn’t bother to go to the doctor. Later, when she came home from work, she realized she had to treat him.

In his hospital room, after he woke up, my husband insisted he didn’t really need to be there. “All doctors do is find things that are wrong with you that aren’t.”

“Like what?” I said.

“They took an X-ray of my chest,” he said, “and they found a spot on my lung.”

“What?” I said. “You’ve got to get that checked out right away.”

“I knew I shouldn’t have told you,” he said. “It’s nothing. They see those spots all the time.”

After a few nurses checked on him, my husband looked at the clock. “You better get home before it gets dark and start up the splitter,” he said. “We really need to put that wood up before the first snowfall.”

I did go home and start up the splitter. I hoisted the logs on it and pushed the lever to send the wood toward the blade. I worried about the spot on my husband’s lung. I noticed that the late-summer sun was turning things a golden color. With the season coming to a close, I wouldn’t see this kind of light for many months. A stray leaf came down, caught in the hazy sunlight. I thought that this is also what real Vermonters do. They stop and admire the scenery around them. They can’t help themselves because it’s so pretty. Then I looked down. My hand guiding the log was almost touching the blade.",REAL
How to Survive a Stampede,"Photo

“Don’t just do what the person next to you does,” says Caesar Saloma, a physics professor at the University of the Philippines who studies the movement of mice escaping confined spaces. In some ways, mice stampede as humans do: Individuals blindly follow one another, clogging some exits and ignoring others. In July, as officials prepared for the Pope’s visit and an outdoor mass for upward of six million people, Saloma was asked to work on the crowd-control plan.

Make a mental map of any crowded venue you enter. “Figure out where the exits are,” says Saloma, whose research involves observing how mice escape from pools of water they are dropped into. At first mice tend to herd, but on later occasions they find all available routes and exit up to seven times faster. You won’t get a practice run, so take a few minutes before your concert or baseball game and visualize an emergency evacuation. “Step by step, what would you do?” Saloma says.

At very high densities of seven or more people per square meter, crowds can resemble fluids, developing, for example, powerful waves that exceed 1,000 pounds of force. Many stampede fatalities result not from trampling but from compressional asphyxia, in which people are squeezed to death upright or in a pileup. Beware of bottlenecks like doorways, where multidirectional pushing can cause a semicircle of bodies packed so tightly that none can move.

Human stampedes occur most often at religious and sporting events. If your faith or fandom permits, skip the most crowded gatherings. “It’s not a bad idea to be a little claustrophobic,” Saloma says. Still, groups are capable of what scientists call self-organization, in which leaderless order emerges spontaneously, as among schooling fish. Researchers cannot experiment on real human stampedes, so it is hard to know what impromptu coordination arises in a crush. But Saloma sees his mice do it. The experienced animals queue up instead of scrambling over one another and escape faster as a result. “We’ve never seen a mouse step aside like a gentleman to let another go first,” he says. “But they do work collectively.”",REAL

RE: BETTY CROCKER CREATIONS

Tamar Adler wrote about the absurd, repulsive and gorgeous concoctions in the Betty Crocker Recipe Card Library, intended to appeal not to the palate but to the eye.

Tamar Adler’s description of Eggs à la Goldenrod (‘‘hard-­boiled egg whites mixed with thick white-­flour-­and-­milk sauce, spread on toast’’) brought to mind one of my favorite recipes from Pierre Franey’s ‘‘More 60-­Minute Gourmet,’’ Les Oeufs à la Tripe. This, too, is essentially sliced boiled eggs in a milk-­and-­flour sauce, which sounds much better when called béchamel. Thirty-­four years later, it remains a brunch staple in our house. Mike Foley, Poughkeepsie, N.Y.

I am sad that you vilified Goldenrod Eggs along with a bunch of lurid Jell-­O-­mold globs that richly deserved condemnation. When I was growing up in Nebraska, Goldenrod Eggs were an occasionally ­served breakfast treat my mom made that we enjoyed. Later, as the mother of three children who were crazy about dyeing way too many Easter eggs, I found Goldenrod Eggs a tasty means of using some of them. I served this dish to house­guests recently, and it was enthusiastically received. Just as we never fancied up the dish by referring to it by its Frenchified name, I do not bother any longer to separate the yolks and grate them on top. All this dish is is creamed, chopped hard-­boiled eggs on toast, but the addition of a healthy amount of Worcestershire to the sauce is absolutely essential. Give it another try. Linda Staubitz, Tucson

I have never seen the recipe cards to which Adler refers, but the Betty Crocker cookbook itself is the only cookbook — and I own a small library of cookbooks — that I own in duplicate! It is essential to motherhood and, more important, to grandmotherhood.",REAL
The Displaced: Introduction,"I have two photos on my desk. The first shows a child, a girl of about 10. She is standing behind an enormous pile of her family’s belongings, which have been tightly packed for a long journey. Her face is blank with uncertainty, but she strikes a bossy pose — one hand on her hip, the other planted firmly against the bundles. Her companions are an older woman, probably her mother, and a little boy — her younger brother? Both look directly at the photographer, Henri Cartier-Bresson, who took this picture in Dessau, as scores of Germans displaced during World War II began returning home. It is 1945. Where has this girl been, and what has she seen?

The second picture, taken in 1974, also shows a girl of about 10. This child is a Kurdish refugee. Her family is sitting with their worldly possessions in a barren field, somewhere near the border with Iran. A meal is underway. The parents sit cross-legged on the ground, intent on their food, while the girl stands, another little girl by her side, and stares into the distance with a wrinkled-brow expression of adult worry. Where is she going?

Young as these girls are, they have already been asked to bear a profound loss. You can see it in their faces. They appear to be only half children, the other half having been matured ahead of schedule by trauma and displacement. They know what they should not. And yet, there is still that other half. They are still kids. Unlike the adults in the frame, who must be constantly aware of their dangerous ordeal, the girls, from time to time, might forget. If the moment was right, they might play a game.

That children, even under the worst of circumstances, are able to remain children supplies the world around them with the sense of a future, which is the equivalent of hope. The history of the world is a history of wars — the sieges of Jerusalem, the Mongol conquests, the Mexican Revolution, World Wars I and II, the Taiping Rebellion, the Armenian genocide, the Napoleonic Wars, the Dungan Revolt, the Vietnam War, the Seven Years’ War, the 30 Years’ War, the Roman civil wars, the Chinese Civil War, the American Civil War, the Chilean civil wars, the Liberian civil wars, the Spanish Civil War. These and countless others are usually fought by young adults and overseen by old men, and it is their experiences that historians tend to consider. But children (and their mothers) are present, too. Those who are not killed wind up displaced, surviving in camps and bombed-out villages, where by their mere presence they contribute to the continuance of humankind. Less obvious than the biological fact of this is the psychological one. If there were no children, would the adults of a refugee camp have the will to endure?

With so many wars behind us, so many around us and so many (we must assume) ahead, it begins to seem as if we are wholly dependent on children to provide the world with whatever minimum fuel of promise is required for it to keep turning. The kids have no choice in the matter. They cannot be any other place or any other age. They can only be resilient, miraculously so. Where does this capability come from? Are children able to recover so quickly from adversity because of their inexperience, because they don’t realize quite how bad things really are? Or is it because they have a greater capacity than adults to live entirely in the present, to lose themselves in a game of soccer or tag? Or perhaps resilience is a concept supplied by adults, who would like to believe that children will overcome the terrible experiences we foist upon them. Much of the research suggests that kids who encounter repeated or sustained trauma and overwhelming stress are likely to suffer outcomes that range from debilitating depression and post-traumatic stress disorder to heart disease and diabetes. Though these children may furnish their ruined cities and shattered families with a little hope, they won’t emerge unscathed.",REAL
The Displaced: Hana,"Once, as Hana was picking plums and staring at a branch, she suddenly remembered that a tree on her family’s property back home in Syria had a swing. We could have one here, she thought — we could take one of these big buckets for carrying plums and attach it to a rope! We could take turns, maybe during a break — and then she jolted out of her daydream. “Idiot,” she told herself, “who’s going to let you have a swing here?” She went back to work, picking plums, counting the hours until she could return to a home that was really no home at all.

Hana came from Mabrouka, a small town in northeast Syria. She last saw her home three years ago, when she was 9 — so long ago, in the life of a girl her age, that she had forgotten as much as she remembered. From the fields where she picked cucumbers, she could see the mountains that divide Lebanon from Syria; a long drive past those mountains was her childhood home in the country. It was almost certainly rubble now, a pile of rocks burying all they left behind: Hana’s favorite doll, dressed like a queen, with long hair down to her waist; the crystal glasses the family rarely used; the proper mattresses; the flush toilet. Towels. Closets. She loved her childhood home, but if she could build a dream house now, it would have big gates, at least three, and only her fingerprint would open them. The locks would recognize only her voice when she called out, “Open, Sesame!”

It troubled Hana’s father, she knew, that her 5-year-old sister, Haifa, thought this was how they had always lived: in this makeshift settlement, in a tent of nylon and wood, alongside some 40 other tents, most of them inhabited by members of Hana’s extended family. In summer, they felt claustrophobic inside the airless homes; in winter, they worried about the roofs collapsing from the weight of the snow. Last winter, the children frequently scrambled up to clear the snow with their bare hands, waiting, all season long, for gloves that an aid agency had promised; by the time the gloves arrived, it was spring.

Photo

Haifa did not remember that they once had air conditioning, or a Chevy parked in front of the house, or childhoods of nothing but play and school. Why, Hana often wondered, had she not appreciated school back in Syria? In Mabrouka, Hana never had to miss school to work — she never worked at all, although sometimes, her dad would give his children some loose change if they brought him a cold drink.

They left that life in the spring of 2012. Hana said she understood little about the political situation that kept her far from home. The protest movement started in Syria in 2011, with the uprising of citizens opposing President Bashar al-Assad’s oppressive government. By the following year, occupied with the uprising elsewhere, Assad’s security forces started withdrawing from rural pockets of Hasaka, the province where Hana’s family lived, and parts of the area quickly felt unsafe: Roaming armed gangs, whose loyalties were not always clear, were extorting farmers, like Hana’s father, for the right to farm their own land. Hana’s family began to hear about clashes between the Sunni Arab opposition and the government. Hana’s father, who had already started working in Lebanon to make extra money, told her mother it was time for them to leave. Hana wanted to bring all her toys, all her dolls, but her mother told her no, there would be toys where they were going. Hana and her siblings had visited their father in Lebanon before, and she did not realize she would probably never return to that house again.

They left for Lebanon by bus. When they reached the border, traffic was at a standstill. Many of the people left their cars, playing cards and picnicking by the side of the road. Her family did the same, relaxing and stretching their legs. Hana heard gunshots; maybe some soldiers near the border were doing some drills, she thought. The mood was almost festive — she was going to see her father soon, for the first time in months. She thought she should look nice for him, so she ran to the bus to find her comb. From the bus, she heard more gunshots and looked outside. She remembers seeing men firing back and forth with Syrian soldiers. Then suddenly she was in the bus driver’s arms, and he was running, carrying her away from the bus with its full tank of gas. Outside, bullets were flying, and before she understood what was happening, she was climbing into a giant cement pipe along with two of her siblings and her mother, all of them cramped in the dark, unable to move, everyone howling or sobbing. “It would have been better to die in our home than die like this,” she screamed at her mother. “Why did you bring us here?”

They ran to an abandoned building to wait out the shooting; how long it lasted, she could not say. Eventually they got back on the bus. That day, her life as a refugee began. She entered a new world, and she never stopped wishing she could return to the old one.

Everyone at the settlement had known that kind of terror. “Please don’t tell me your story,” she would say to her friends, “because if you do, it will make me think of what happened to me.” And then she would tell them exactly what had happened to her. Whenever a disturbing news story about Syria played on a television they had in the tent, the children cried. Hana, too — not so much because they were all disturbed by the latest horror, she thought, but because they were reliving their own.

One of her favorite cousins at the settlement was Abboudi, who was also 12. One day, when he was still living in Syria, militia fighters in masks — presumably extremists in the opposition — walked into his school pulling a Syrian Army soldier. The men in masks forced the students to form a circle in the courtyard. They stood behind the students to make sure they could not run away. Then they shot the man in the back of the head, and cut his head off, to send a message to anyone sympathetic to the government. For Abboudi, that was the end of his childhood as he knew it. He never returned to school in Syria, and several months later, his family joined Hana’s at the settlement.

Hana felt particularly protective toward her cousin Marah, Mustafa’s sister, who was 13 and had been one of her closest playmates back in Mabrouka. Marah’s school, too, had been overrun by men in masks with guns. Now the field labor, for her, was its own kind of trial. It was tough for everyone, but somehow, especially so for Marah. She could not withstand the sun, the physical work itself, the yelling from the supervisor. Hana would throw her arm around Marah on the bumpy truck, as they headed out to the fields, holding her as she would a much smaller child.

Photo

In Syria, Marah’s father was the one who owned the land, who employed the workers — dozens of them. Now her father was gaunt from tuberculosis, and had nothing; now they were the workers, Marah and her mother and her brother. The supervisor yelled at them — cursed at them! Blasphemed at them! — if he thought they were not working hard enough. Marah had succumbed to sunstroke three times already, woozy, nauseated, close to collapse. When her mother took her to the clinic, even the doctor insulted them, lecturing her mother about sending her daughter off to do child labor. Suraiya, poised and elegant, showed no rage but simply explained that without the money Marah made at work, the family would not have enough to eat through the winter.

For a long time, it seemed to Marah that they should just go back to Syria. They would not have to join one side or another — they could just go back to their big house with the sunny eat-in kitchen and its comfortable couch and stay there, quietly. They would not bother anyone, and no one would curse at them and all would be well. Finally, she asked her mother why they could not just do so. “Because they will do worse than yell at us,” Suraiya told her. “They will cut off our heads.” Marah never asked to go back to Syria again.

There are currently estimated to be 30 million children who have been displaced by war — children longing for home, or too terrified to think of home, or trying to forget home and settle somewhere new.

More than from any other country, they come from Syria: Since the war started in 2011, more than four million Syrians have fled the country, at least half of whom are thought to be children. What started as a protest movement had become, by 2013, a full-blown civil war, with various opposition and extremist groups fighting one another as well as the government. Recently violence has spiked along with poverty in Syria; Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have also tightened their borders, which has compelled more and more Syrians to make the treacherous journey to Western Europe.

But the vast majority of Syrian refugee children — some two million, according to a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimate — have already settled in those nearby countries. There, they endure, with their families, the slow grind of lives in limbo. In Turkey and Jordan, the U.N.H.C.R. or the local government has built sprawling refugee camps; Lebanon has not allowed or built these camps, for fear of creating a permanent Syrian population in this small country (already, at least one million Syrian refugees have arrived in Lebanon, a country of four and a half million). So vulnerable families build haphazard housing, tents that clutter fields by the side of the road, or squat in abandoned buildings. In Lebanon’s cities, the more desperate Syrian children sell paper flowers and beg in the streets long into the night.

Unlike the children en route to Europe, or arriving in Europe, Hana and those like her suffer through a waiting game. Hana seems sustained by an ever-waning sense of hope that she can eventually go home to recapture some of what has been lost, while knowing all the while that already, so early in her life, so much is gone for good.

Inside the settlement, Hana was someone. She was a hand-on-hip kind of girl, the kind whom other children naturally let mediate their disputes. She pierced girls’ ears — only she had the stomach for it — and when she finished her own work in the field, she rushed to help Ala’a and Ala’a’s twin sister, Wala’a, so they, too, could have a break.

Photo

Her father was someone there, too: the shawish, a leader and the middleman who arranged for his extended family to find work in the fields. Her uncles were the pillars of their communities back in Syria: a high-school principal, the town mayor. Outside the settlement, that meant nothing. “ISIS scum,” a Lebanese man once spat at her father. This was as baffling as it was enraging, since no one hated ISIS more than they all did. Before they moved to the settlement, they lived in two others: Each was set aflame — most likely, she had been told, by Lebanese who did not want them there.

It is illegal for the Syrian refugees to work in Lebanon, which meant the supervisors could treat them badly — sometimes they didn’t pay them after they worked long days. One afternoon, Ala’a and Wala’a came back from picking chickpeas looking wild-eyed. The supervisor who was renting the land had been furious with the group, ostensibly for asking for cold water, but most likely because he realized he had waited too long to harvest his chickpeas, and now they were useless. In a fury, he set fire to a pile of crates, threatening to burn the field along with everyone in it. Usually, Hana hoped to work with Ala’a and Wala’a, but she was glad she had not been there that day.",REAL
The Displaced: Chuol,"For weeks, he and his grandmother swam and waded through snake-infested waters, dodging crocodiles, eating little more than grass. Chuol was constantly afraid that he might die. If a soldier did not kill him, he thought, an animal surely would.

“We would swim for so long until we could swim no more,” he recalled. “But we could sometimes still hear the gunfire and needed to keep moving. So we pulled ourselves along by the reeds.”

In July, they arrived on one of the small islands that dot the vast swamp, joining some 80,000 other displaced people. (The New York Times agreed not to name the exact location out of concern for the family’s safety.) For months, the conflict prevented widespread humanitarian aid from reaching the increasingly desperate masses hiding on this muddy sliver of land. But by late summer, a lull in fighting and a tentative peace agreement allowed food and other supplies from groups like Unicef to be airlifted again to the region.

This fall, Chuol and his grandmother were able to get to a camp in Juba, South Sudan’s capital, before traveling to another camp in Kenya to join other relatives. Chuol’s grandmother told him she is planning to go back to South Sudan to look for his mother. Unicef has received reports that she has been seen alive in the country.

When I spoke to Chuol this past summer, he was still on the island in the swamp. He recalled how his mother worked for humanitarian organizations before they were forced to flee — clearing an airstrip and doing other odd jobs to help them get by.

“Sometimes, before we were displaced, I would dream about being able to learn more and then going to work for a humanitarian organization,” he said. “Or maybe even becoming a doctor and working in a hospital where I can help people.” He looked down at his hands, pausing for a moment, lost in his thoughts. “If I grow up and leave this place,” he said, “maybe I can still become a doctor.”",REAL
The Displaced: Oleg,"Battles raged in and around Nikishino in the ensuing months, and the separatists eventually took control. Oleg’s family heard nothing from Galina’s father. As cease-fire talks halted the worst of the fighting in February, Oleg’s family, along with a few dozen others, returned to the village. They discovered her father’s body in the backyard of his house. He had probably been killed by shrapnel and had lain frozen outside for months. “Before the war, I visited him every day,” Oleg, now 11, said. “Now I visit his grave.”

Most of the village’s 360 houses were wholly or partly destroyed. Oleg’s home was one of them: A shell hit his bedroom and blew a hole through the roof. His school was hit, too. Looking at the ruined building, Oleg said, “When the teachers would yell at us, we used to say: ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if the school blew up?’ I would never say that anymore.”

The war has divided Ukraine into three parts: a main territory under the central government; the Crimean Peninsula, claimed by Russia; and the separatist zone where Nikishino lies. As the conflict settles into a stalemate — with a cease-fire but no final resolution, much less any plan for reconstruction — roughly 3.2 million people, including Oleg and his family, now live amid destruction or in dire need of humanitarian aid. Oleg’s father has returned to work in the coal mines, and Oleg goes to school in a neighboring village. As his parents repair their home, the family lives in the portion of the house that is still standing. Once picturesque, Nikishino is today a tableau of shattered glass, broken concrete and scorched timber. “I tell myself: No matter what happens, even if shells are falling, I will never leave my home again,” Oleg said. He still speeds around the village on his bicycle with his friends, roaming this no man’s land.",REAL
Virtual Reality: A New Way to Tell Stories,"Photo

One hundred nineteen years ago, the inaugural issue of this magazine published the first photographs ever to appear in The New York Times, beginning on the cover with three small halftone images of the former presidential candidates Stephen Douglas, John Bell and John Breckinridge. Elsewhere in the magazine, readers found images of X-rays, then a nascent technology, showing a hand and a foot. Now, more than 6,000 Sundays later, the magazine is proud to introduce another visual innovation: In conjunction with this week’s cover story on the global refugee crisis, we are unveiling The New York Times’s first contribution to the new field of virtual-­reality journalism.

Until now, V.R. has been seen mostly as a revolutionary new platform for video games, but it has the potential to transform journalism as well. At the magazine, we first began experimenting with the technology in April, when we shot a short film with the V.R. production studio Vrse about the making of our ‘‘Walking New York’’ cover. We didn’t promote this project at the time, but we were happy enough with the results to begin making plans for the film that we’re releasing now, also a collaboration with Vrse: a 10-minute journey through the lives of three different children who have been driven from their homes by war. ‘‘The Displaced’’ takes place in a Syrian refugee settlement in Lebanon, an encampment of displaced people in South Sudan and a war-torn village in eastern Ukraine. It focuses on — and is narrated by — three children, Chuol, Hana and Oleg.

Watching your first V.R. film takes a little bit of effort, but the payoff is well worth it. First, you’ll have to get our new NYT VR app, available free in the App Store and Google Play. Then you’ll have to download the film itself, which may take a few minutes, depending on your connection speed. If you’re a print subscriber, you will receive a Google Cardboard V.R. viewer with your paper this weekend, which you can use to watch the film. If you don’t have a viewer, you can simply watch the film on your smartphone alone.

Filming in V.R. also requires some effort. Rather than using one camera, a V.R. rig uses many, clustered together and pointing in all directions. The footage from this contraption is reconciled in postproduction to create a wraparound environment, with the viewer positioned at the center, like a sun within a solar system. To stay out of the shot, the filmmaker has to set up his camera rig, begin recording and then run and hide, peering from behind a haystack or a trash bin and hoping that the action unfolds the way he imagined. For this reason, V.R. usually involves more coordination between filmmaker and subject than in traditional video journalism. A subject may be asked to repeat an action, or wait until the filmmaker is out of sight to complete a task.

For ‘‘The Displaced,’’ which was shot in the field and directed by Imraan Ismail of Vrse and Ben C. Solomon, a Times video journalist, there was an additional challenge — that of filming in remote and dangerous areas. But the results are breathtaking. By breaking free from the rectangular editorial frame of a traditional documentary film, V.R. invests the viewer with an uncanny feeling of agency, a sense of being able to look around for yourself. Your living room or kitchen falls away. Turning this way and that, examining the sky or a cucumber or a lily pad, you begin to feel present in these vivid locations, a virtual witness to these children’s precarious lives.

It is hard to know whether readers of the magazine’s issue on Sept. 6, 1896, were as transported by the newspaper’s first photographs as I hope the readers of today will be by ‘‘The Displaced.’’ But we are proud to carry on a tradition — one as old as journalism itself — of pressing new technologies into the service of storytelling.",REAL

How to Help,"Photo

Every day in 2014, an average of 42,500 people left their homes looking for protection and safety elsewhere, and the number of refugees in the world has quadrupled in the past five years, to close to 60 million. More than 50 percent of those refugees are children, the highest figure for child refugees in more than a decade. Chuol, Hana and Oleg — the children featured in the New York Times Magazine article “The Displaced” — are three young refugees who were forced to leave everything behind because of violence, conflict and persecution.

Here is a list of some of the organizations collecting donations for child refugees, compiled by Charity Navigator, a nonprofit group that evaluates charities. Additional organizations are listed on Charity Navigator’s website.

United States Fund for Unicef

In 1946, Unicef was founded to help children in postwar conflict zones. Today the organization works to secure its founding belief that “all children have a right to survive, thrive and fulfill their potential — to the benefit of a better world.”

U.S.A. for U.N.H.C.R.

U.S.A. for U.N.H.C.R. “helps and protects refugees and people displaced by violence, conflict and persecution.” The organization helps refugees return to their homeland, and if they can’t go back home, U.N.H.C.R. helps them rebuild their lives in another country.

Save the Children

Save the Children helps children in 120 countries, including the United States, by providing resources and setting up child-friendly spaces in emergency shelters. It has provided aid to Syrian children fleeing to Greece, Serbia and Hungary.

World Food Programme

Steve Deace and the Power of Conservative Media,"Presidential candidates are trying to manage this anger and rebelliousness, in part by courting the messengers. By Deace’s own accounting, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, Rand Paul and Bobby Jindal have been on his show ‘‘a ton’’ in the past year. Ben Carson, another repeat guest, sent a photo in which he is reading Deace’s 2014 book, ‘‘Rules for Patriots,’’ on a flight. ‘‘I know Donald Trump on a first-name basis, which is crazy for a kid from Iowa,’’ Deace says. He and Cruz also were ‘‘on a first-name basis’’ long before Deace endorsed Cruz this summer.

For many longtime Republicans, this bottom-up tumult from the party base in both the presidential and the legislative arenas is deeply unnerving. How can it be, they ask, that Republicans, traditionally so hierarchical and relatively disciplined — relative, that is, to Democrats — have become so divided and dysfunctional that serious people speculate about the collapse of a 161-year-old political party? Yet whether evolution or revolution, the rise of anti-establishment conservatives is in fact easy to understand when listening to the ‘‘Steve Deace Show.’’

Make money.’’ The program is devoted to the week’s political developments, from Congress to geopolitics. Deace typically engages his studio mates — Maxwell and Todd Erzen, a 43-year-old former newspaper reporter who edits the Deace show website — for half the show, unscripted and with the easy familiarity of siblings talking politics; they almost never disagree on issues, though sometimes they differ on tactics. The second hour often features frequent guests like Vander Plaats, or drop-bys like Ted Cruz’s politically active father, Rafael Cruz. ‘‘The only time we have tension with our audience these days is when we’re not as brutal on the G.O.P. hackery as they are,’’ Deace says.

The commentary is, to say the least, provocative:

On Obama: ‘‘We have a Marxist in the White House, and our very way of life is at stake.’’ (Ninety-one percent of respondents to a poll question on Deace’s website, ‘‘do not believe Barack Obama is a Christian.’’)

On gay rights advocates, a.k.a. ‘‘the Rainbow jihad’’: The issue is whether ‘‘someone’s erotic liberty trumps your religious liberty.’’

On socially progressive Republicans: ‘‘Seriously, if you’re for amnesty, for killing babies and for redefining marriage, why are you even a Republican at all?’’

On the Republican Party ‘‘brand’’: ‘‘Pass Obama’s agenda, lie to conservatives, defraud voters and total capitulation.’’

On his least favorite candidate: ‘‘Is Jeb Bush running for president or America’s Hispanic fertility czar?’’

Polls consistently show hard-liners’ views on immigration, climate change and some social issues are not shared by the majority of self-identified Republicans. But the people who tune in daily to Deace and his ultraconservative peers are also the ones most likely to vote and to follow closely the politicians they elect. A survey of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center showed that most conservative Americans get their news from conservative media, mainly Fox News, and distrust the rest, while liberals generally trust and consult a greater variety of political news sources.

Republican leaders and strategists have long played to these conservatives’ leanings at election time — with anti-government rhetoric and unachievable promises on Obamacare, immigration and abortion. Now far-right voters, having helped Republicans win control of Congress and many state capitals, are not buying the party establishment’s excuses for why these promises have not been kept. Hardly a day passes when Deace doesn’t complain that conservatives might as well have left Democrats in charge of the Senate.

The party infighting has made it difficult for Republicans to govern. Representative Tom Latham of Iowa was no stranger to confrontational politics, having gone to Congress 20 years ago as part of the so-called Republican Revolution that ended the Democrats’ 40-year lock on the House majority. But Latham retired this year, frustrated that conservative media and its audience had made it practically impossible to pass essential legislation like appropriations and increases in the nation’s debt limit without a crisis. Latham says correspondence from his constituents more than quintupled from his first year in office to about 40,000 in his last, much of it angry ultimatums generated by media figures like Deace.

‘‘They will not take 80 percent — it’s got to be 100 percent, or you’re not pure,’’ Latham told me over breakfast at a Des Moines diner. ‘‘They don’t give a damn about governing.’’ Most Republicans ‘‘are happy with incremental progress and not this utopian, 100-percent-or-nothing idea,’’ Latham continued. ‘‘But the activists out there — the people who show up on caucus nights or who vote in the primaries — are the ones who are influenced by the media.’’ Yet when asked if Republican leaders helped create this unappeasable monster he describes, Latham concedes: ‘‘Oh, yeah! Are you kidding?’’

Talkers, a trade publication that covers the radio industry, estimates there are 5,000 political talk-radio hosts nationwide. Rural areas and big cities have their own conservative radio voices — like Charlie Sykes and Mark Belling in Wisconsin and Erick Erickson in Georgia. Increasingly influential are upstart online news sites like Breitbart, The Blaze, The Daily Caller, The Federalist, Townhall and a new arrival, Conservative Review, which counts Deace among its contributors. Wealthy investors and well-financed conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation have helped to fund some of the national outlets. So, too, have more obscure investors at the local level. Deace says some Christian businessmen in Iowa have backed him financially since 2010, when he and other conservatives helped to defeat three members of the Iowa Supreme Court who had approved same-sex marriage. (Deace was also widely credited for helping the underdog Mike Huckabee win Iowa’s 2008 Republican caucuses.) While Deace won’t name the backers, citing nondisclosure agreements, public records indicate one patron is David C. Kutscher, a conservative businessman from West Des Moines. Kutscher would not name other investors when I reached him, but he joked that they’re not in the same league with the well-known pairs of billionaire brothers, the Kochs and the Wilks, who finance conservative causes. “We really did get into it with the idea of forwarding Steve’s message,” he told me. Deace recounts: ‘‘They came to me and said: ‘We’ve seen the impact you’ve had in our home state, and we’re concerned about the direction of the country. And we’re wondering if we put a company around you and gave you the connections and the resources you needed to branch out there, would you be interested in seeing if you could have this kind of impact nationally?’’

The investment has so far paid off. Before the 2012 election year, Deace left the statewide radio giant WHO for national syndication, reducing his Iowa footprint in a bid for broader influence. While some Republicans in Des Moines and Washington say Deace should have stayed at WHO — ‘‘a very big fish in a small pond,’’ says Craig Robinson, a former Iowa Republican Party official — Talkers moved Deace up to 63rd on its list of top 100 talk-radio hosts, from 99th in 2014. This month he expands his reach farther, joining Salem Radio Network, the Christian-oriented news-talk syndicate whose stable includes the conservative celebrity-talkers William Bennett, Hugh Hewitt and Michael Medved. Like the rambunctious conservatives he speaks for, Deace is ascendant.

Very little of Deace’s biography would suggest any of this. At his comfortable two-story home in suburban West Des Moines, after a family dinner of lasagna and iceberg lettuce prepared by his wife, Amy, the younger children — Zoe, 10, and Noah, 8 — went off to separate rooms. Ana, who is 14, curled around her mother’s ottoman while her parents unspooled Deace’s story in such adult-level detail that I signaled maybe we could talk about this another time? But Ana has heard it before. She is the same age Deace’s mother, Vickie McNeeley, was when she became pregnant with him by an older high-school classmate from a prominent local family. Deace was born in July 1973, six months after the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade. McNeeley later told me she never considered abortion despite suggestions from her boyfriend’s family. ‘‘I was pretty mature for my age,’’ she said. ‘‘My body, my baby.’’ According to McNeeley, the boyfriend’s father paid $500 to Deace’s grandmother — a poor, twice-divorced single mom of five children — for her signature on a paper denying his son’s paternity.

Before Deace was 3, his mother married a sailor, and the family moved to Grand Rapids, Mich. His stepfather, who did not adopt Deace but gave the boy his surname, abused Deace and especially his mother, Deace said. At this point in the story, Amy Deace interrupted. Every year, she said, she takes down Christmas decorations when her husband is away because, for him, the activity triggers memories of dark, post-holiday winters punctuated by his stepfather’s drinking and beatings. When Deace resumed, the story didn’t get much rosier: Rejected by the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Deace went to Michigan State University, flunked out, partied hard, bet excessively on sports and, indebted, fled a threatening bookie back to his grandmother’s house in Des Moines. (‘‘I hit the triple crown of dysfunction’’ — a single mom, abusive father figure, failures of his own — Deace wrote in Conservative Review in July.)

Eventually Deace landed a part-time sports-reporting job at The Des Moines Register and parlayed that into radio work. Iowa has no major-league sports teams, so Deace filled off-seasons with talk of politics — a mix that is not uncommon in conservative talk radio, where audiences are primarily white and male and hosts toggle between the two topics. His commentary was so well received that in 2006, Deace was promoted to the drive-time talk show at WHO. Deace’s other conversion — to evangelical Christianity — came in 2003; never religious before, he suddenly became a believer while attending a Kansas City rally of Promise Keepers, the Christian organization for men.

Deace’s mother, a registered Democrat, followed him back to Des Moines and has since divorced and remarried. Open and warm, with a big, billowing laugh, she marvels at his success: ‘‘He is just such a wonderful son and man and father that he just never ceases to amaze me.’’ But she no longer listens to his show. ‘‘I’m still a mom, and it still hurts me when people say mean things to my son,’’ McNeeley, 57, says. ‘‘Even some of the things Steven says — I’ll cringe at some of the things he says, lots of the things that he says’’ — she will not specify which. ‘‘My face is getting red now just thinking about it.’’ She does not agree with his politics, but says she will not tell even him what those differences are. She will only say this: ‘‘A lot of the things that Steven feels strongly about, I feel strongly about, too. But I also believe there are gray areas in things, and Steven does not. He sees only black and white.’’ That was true even when Deace was a boy and, as his mother recalled, not unlike the conservative teenager Alex P. Keaton on the Reagan-era TV show ‘‘Family Ties.’’ She says, ‘‘I’d look across the table and think, Who are you, and what have you done with my real child? I don’t know where he developed these ultraconservative views.’’

Deace is somewhat unusual among conservative-media figures for having endorsed a presidential candidate. With a Republican field as large and uniformly conservative as this one, many of his peers have been slow to take sides. The one thing they unite on is their rejection of Jeb Bush, whom they perceive as the establishment’s candidate. Bush’s refusal to woo them has only intensified the antipathy; he is one of the few 2016 contenders who has not appeared on Deace’s show. ‘‘If you’re not coming to me and bugging me to have access to the people that are going to decide this thing’’ — his audience — ‘‘that probably tells me all I need to know about you,’’ Deace says.

Marco Rubio has also not visited Deace’s show. Deace disqualifies both Bush and Rubio for their immigration stance, but he has seemed conflicted about the more charismatic Rubio. ‘‘I love Marco Rubio to death,’’ he said by phone in March. The two men privately communicated earlier this year, and Deace says that when he solicited nine Republicans’ views about defying judicial rulings favoring same-sex marriage, Rubio’s response was the most eloquently supportive of ‘‘religious liberty.’’ In our conversations, Deace repeatedly described the Florida senator, who at 44 is roughly Deace’s age, as smart, talented and likable — ‘‘too talented and too young to write off forever.’’ Yet he cannot forgive Rubio’s role in the bipartisan ‘‘Gang of 8’’ that in 2013 won Senate passage of an immigration-reform bill (it died in the hostile House), nor, he says, can his audience: ‘‘They’re that angry about it.’’ Deace apparently sees no change of sentiment, saying on air recently that Rubio ‘‘screwed the pooch with the conservative grass roots.’’

For Deace and many conservatives, another rap against Bush — and Scott Walker, who has already left the race — is the sense that they were being promoted by what the hard-liners have come to see as the mouthpiece of the establishment: Fox News. Deace told me in March: ‘‘There are self-appointed gatekeepers in conservative media who think it is their job to tell the rest of us out here what we’re to think. Maybe because I still live in Iowa, I get a little offended by that.’’ He and his followers were grousing about Fox and its stable of ‘‘Bushies’’ like Karl Rove months before the first Republican presidential debate drew headlines for conservatives’ backlash about Fox, whose correspondents were perceived to be unfairly grilling the anti-establishment candidates Cruz and Trump. In February a caller asked Deace why Fox had ‘‘a virtual blackout’’ of Cruz. ‘‘I have no idea,’’ Deace told him, ‘‘but you are not the first person to notice it, trust me.’’

Deace recoils at my suggestion that he, too, is a kind of gatekeeper. ‘‘I view myself as the same as our listeners,’’ he counters. ‘‘The only difference is that I have a microphone in front of me. I view myself as a proxy.’’ But would a proxy endorse a candidate before the people for whom he speaks have made up their own minds? ‘‘I put my own role as an activist ahead of the radio show,’’ Deace says.

Before making his pick, Deace told me, he consulted with his chief political adviser: his wife. Deace and Amy took Cruz to Deace’s favorite restaurant, Johnny’s Italian Steakhouse in Des Moines — ‘‘Rat Pack ambiance,’’ it advertises — so that Amy could ‘‘size him up.’’ ‘‘Amy came to the same conclusion that I came to,’’ he says, namely that Cruz was the fighter the times demand. ‘‘Ted Cruz embodies the conservative base, especially for a lot of people my age.’’ He adds, ‘‘We’re more conservative, less Republican.’’

On the October show in which Deace read Bookout’s email against beta Republicans, attacks against the establishment consumed the entire two hours. In the first, Deace and company inveighed against efforts to make Paul Ryan speaker of the House, even condemning the young congressman with the ultimate pejorative: ‘‘RINO,’’ Republican in Name Only. (Deace later called him an ‘‘amnesty pimp.’’) In the second hour, Deace read nine emails, eight of which skewered Republicans. One listener asked, ‘‘Steve, do you see a time when the G.O.P. splits?’’ Deace told him, ‘‘You’re living in a party that is in an open civil war as we speak.’’ When Maxwell predicted that a new party would surface to replace ‘‘this death rattle of a political party,’’ her metaphor instantly called to Deace’s mind one of his most frequent targets: Mitch McConnell, the funereal Senate majority leader. ‘‘And is there anybody who just seems as if they couldn’t possibly be more typecast to run a death rattle than ‘Ditch’ McConnell?’’ he interjected. ‘‘Funeral parlor C.E.O.!’’

Another listener said House conservatives should not let Boehner resign but should instead vote to unseat him as threatened. Deace loved this notion and turned to his studio collaborator, Erzen: ‘‘Todd, just strictly talking as dudes for a second, isn’t that a cool-dude move?’’ Deace wasn’t concerned that conservatives hadn’t picked a successor at that point. Organized governance, he said, could wait until the Republicans’ ‘‘civil war’’ was over. ‘‘Nobody’s winning, there’s just killing happening,’’ he said moments earlier, using one of his favorite metaphors from history. ‘‘At some point, though, someone will win.’’ The armies, he concluded, haven’t reached Appomattox yet.",REAL
Mary Gaitskill and the Life Unseen,"Gaitskill isn’t scary because she conjures monsters; monsters, she points out, are almost always in fashion. What makes her scary, and what makes her exciting, is her ability to evoke the hidden life, the life unseen, the life we don’t even know we are living. The critic Greil Marcus, a champion of her work, calls her a descendant of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne ‘‘is aware of the hidden chambers in the heart,’’ he told me. ‘‘He is aware that there are things that people won’t talk about and there are things that people can’t talk about — and those aren’t the same things. He wants to reveal all those layers.’’ Gaitskill’s fiction unfolds in these psychological spaces; she knows that we, unlike plants, don’t always grow toward the light, that sometimes we cannot even be coaxed toward it.

Gaitskill has a soft, high voice, and she speaks haltingly, with great care, as if she is on the witness stand. Every word seems to pass through some rigorous internal inspection, and only then is it delivered, gingerly, and immediately revised for accuracy. ‘‘A friend’’ — she began a story and then corrected herself — ‘‘someone I know, who I actually have an ambivalent relationship with.’’ In this way, slowly, circumspectly, we discussed the new book, which at first glance feels out of place in her oeuvre.

‘‘The Mare’’ doesn’t have the usual feel of Gaitskill’s fiction, the prickly wit and enveloping sanctuary, the lure of a dark bar on a hot day. It’s earnest and violently of the daylight, stuffed with squalling schoolchildren and focused less on missing connections than surviving them. Velveteen Vargas — Velvet — is the unequivocal heroine of the book (another first for Gaitskill), an 11-year-old Dominican-­American from Crown Heights who is sent upstate by a Fresh Air Fund-­like organization to spend the summer with a white couple, Ginger and Paul, who have no children of their own. In chapters that rotate points of view, we see Ginger’s increasing attachment to the child and Paul’s increasing anxiety. (‘‘There was something unnerving about the way Ginger was toward Velvet,’’ he thinks. ‘‘Something fevered, with a whiff of addiction.’’) We meet Velvet’s mother — cruel, combustible Mrs. Vargas, who is provoked by Ginger’s meddling — and Velvet herself, the still point at the center of so much adult muddle, a young girl consumed with earning the trust of an abused horse.

‘‘The Mare’’ is a more expansive, more elaborately plotted story than we’ve come to expect from Gaitskill, and it’s not a book she ever wanted to write, she told me. What, after all, does she know of motherhood or writing from the point of view of a poor child of another race — let alone horses? But Gaitskill has always written from the margins, peering in: Feelings of exclusion and confusion powerfully motor her imagination. And in ‘‘The Mare,’’ in writing about race, poverty and family life, she has traveled to some of the farthest vistas of her career.

At some point in our conversation, I discovered that Gaitskill had figured out how to turn off my recorder, which was lying between us on the table. She’s fond of talking off the record, and she batted at the machine with a quick, sure motion, like a cat. Only then would she talk about her family, say, or go deeper into her past. She apologized once, wryly, ‘‘I’m sure it would make for a more dramatic piece.’’

But much of what she was hesitant to discuss is known and even threaded into her fiction. Gaitskill was born in Lexington, Ky., in 1954. Her family moved often — sometimes when her father, a teacher, transferred jobs, usually around Detroit. There is still a suburban teenage argot that creeps into her diction from time to time (‘‘skank,’’ ‘‘harsh on’’). She and her two younger sisters were forced to change schools constantly, and she grew up shy and often ostracized. The dread of those years emerges in her novel ‘‘Two Girls, Fat and Thin’’ — the fearsome world of the playground and the boys who had ‘‘faces like knives.’’ Gaitskill read ravenously, with the withdrawn child’s taste for stories of men of action: She loved ‘‘Tarzan’’ and ‘‘Peter Pan’’ and ‘‘The Lord of the Rings’’ — anything, she said, involving a quest in which people encounter enchanted beings. She even became enamored of a biography of Napoleon; in her isolation, she found his poignant.

High school went badly. She almost flunked out of one and was kicked out of another, a boarding school, which she described as a kind of Oz, lots of drugs, lots of hanging out on patches of ice on Lake Michigan. The rich kids had it figured out, she told me. They could get high and still manage their schoolwork. She never could. When she was 15, her psychiatrist advised her parents to have her committed. She ran away, or tried to. She had an idea of making it to New York, but shortly after she left, she was picked up by the police and taken home. Her parents soon sent her to a state mental institution. For two months, she was held there, without ever receiving an official diagnosis. Later in life, she would meet other women, contemporaries who had also been institutionalized for no real reason, perhaps for being promiscuous or unruly.

She drifted — from Canada to California and back again — selling flowers on the street, stripping, doing occasional sex work and beginning to think about writing. In her 20s, she returned to Michigan to go to the community college where her father taught, which she could attend free. She took remedial writing classes and studied journalism at the University of Michigan, while writing fiction on the side.

Of her mentors or friends in these years, she mentions only one — an eccentric older man, a used bookseller ‘‘with huge weird eyes,’’ who seemed to have read everything and encouraged her early work. She won the university’s prestigious Avery Hopwood writing award in 1981 and moved that year to New York, where she worked as a proofreader and receptionist and began writing the nine stories that would become ‘‘Bad Behavior.’’

Her first novel, ‘‘Two Girls, Fat and Thin,’’ about the acolytes of an Ayn Rand-­like figure, was published in 1991, and the story collection ‘‘Because They Wanted To’’ followed in 1997. A story from ‘‘Bad Behavior,’’ ‘‘Secretary,’’ in which a young woman and her boss develop a sadomasochistic relationship, was made into the 2002 film starring James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal, which Gaitskill found ‘‘too cute and ham-­fisted.’’ She earned sobriquets like ‘‘queen of kink’’ and ‘‘downtown princess of darkness.’’ Such was her reputation that Emily Nussbaum, profiling her in 2005 in New York Magazine, removed her engagement ring before the interview (‘‘It just seemed ... uncool,’’ she explained), only to discover that her subject had herself recently gotten engaged. Gaitskill met Peter Trachtenberg while they were both teaching at a writing workshop for veterans and married him four days after the Sept. 11 attacks — her guests arrived ‘‘stunned and gray,’’ she told Nussbaum. (The couple separated in 2010.) In 2005, her novel ‘‘Veronica,’’ which followed the friendship between a former model and a woman dying of AIDS, was nominated for a National Book Award.

Her characters grew up along with her. No longer proofreaders and prostitutes, they became M.F.A. professors or journalists on glamorous assignments. But everything she has written tells a version of one story — in the middle of the life of this proofreader or professor, a trapdoor suddenly opens. She is allowed a vision of the real essence of existence, something ‘‘sensate and unbearably deep,’’ as Gaitskill writes in her 2009 collection, ‘‘Don’t Cry’’ — the world as animals experience it, beyond language.

Early in Gaitskill’s work, it was sex that opened the trapdoor, or music. But beginning with ‘‘Don’t Cry,’’ and now with ‘‘The Mare,’’ it has been children.

Gaitskill and Trachtenberg considered adoption but decided against it for complex reasons. Gaitskill wasn’t sure she could balance parenting with her writing life, and there were financial concerns. Instead, for many years, they hosted two Dominican-­American siblings at their home in upstate New York through the Fresh Air Fund. Gaitskill describes their mother as abusive, and she and Trachtenberg became deeply involved in the children’s lives, paying for a Catholic school and helping them with their homework. But the relationship grew tense — she wrote in the literary magazine Granta that the boy found living away from home confusing, at one point accusing Gaitskill of thinking herself superior to his mother; the girl ran away from her mother’s house and ended up at a group home after being judged too wild for foster care.

Much of this experience has found its way into ‘‘The Mare,’’ which is a novel about how love can be inflected by race and class and privilege. Gaitskill was reluctant to start the project, but she began to be visited by whole scenes, and then a strange feeling of possibility. ‘‘I felt these crazy surges of optimism,’’ she told me. ‘‘I was all over the map. I was telling a lot of people I loved them, and I meant it. My marriage broke up during that time — perhaps not surprisingly. The book was part of that. I could do something that felt unrealistic.’’ She took riding lessons and became, like Velvet, attached to a neglected horse of her own (she shows me a blurry photo of him on her phone and apologizes for his ‘‘winter weight’’). But at a certain point, she had misgivings: ‘‘I remember crying about it and telling somebody, ‘I’m making a fool of myself, and I can’t get out of it because I’m halfway through.’ ’’

After we had been talking for a while, Gaitskill got up for more water and frowned at the bottle in the fridge. It was Russian mineral water, and she wasn’t sure where it came from. There was a tentativeness to her movements in this apartment — she has lived here two years, but she didn’t seem to fully inhabit it yet. I couldn’t detect many traces of her: the pile of books in the kitchen, perhaps, the issue of Bookforum in the living room. The sunflowers in a small jar. I asked to see where she works. She writes drafts in the kitchen, she said, and types them at a small desk beneath a colorful painting in the dark front room. This painting is, frankly, insane. It features a cartoonish dog and cat, eyes agog. The perspective is slightly off, so the animals look as if they are simultaneously shrinking and growing — hallucinations that are themselves hallucinating. Gaitskill loves it. It was made by a friend of hers, a failed painter who never managed to sell the work in this series. I find it strange and touching that Gaitskill keeps it so close to where she herself creates. It feels like both warning and goad.

In ‘‘The Mare,’’ Gaitskill tries to evoke the effects of power, how it feels when it works on you, but you can’t quite name or comprehend it. Which is another way of saying that the novel harrows the particular plot she has made her own all these years, of weakness — and why it repels. (Proving her point, the critic James Wolcott once called her female characters ‘‘dishrags.’’) We are phobic of weakness, we treat it like a contagion, averting our eyes and hoping for the best. But Gaitskill puts her fingers in the wound. Even among other artists attracted to weakness as a theme, she is rare in being able to look at it on its own terms. She doesn’t treat it like a curiosity, like Diane Arbus, or a chink in the armor that might let in faith, like Flannery O’Connor. She isn’t afraid of it, like Muriel Spark; nor does she insist its depictions rouse us to action, like Sontag. She looks — just looks — and sees everything: how weakness is despised, how weakness can be cunning, how victims aren’t merely saints or dupes. ‘‘She has a way of noticing,’’ Lorin Stein, the editor of The Paris Review, told me. ‘‘There’s that line of Fred Seidel’s: ‘Everyone’s a sexual object. Everyone is something to use. Everyone is something good.’ That line makes me think of Gaitskill.’’

Two weeks later, I took a train to Tivoli, N.Y., a small town in the Hudson Valley where Gaitskill used to live and where she was visiting friends. This is the trip Velvet experiences in ‘‘The Mare,’’ the same shock of tumbling out of the sweltering city into a world so tended, so white and gaudily green. Gaitskill came to collect me from the station. She wore a soft-­looking Mets T-shirt, jeans, running shoes — all gray, a gray that almost matches her hair. The effect, from a distance, was rather like chain mail. She was more aloof today, slightly hooded. ‘‘Brace yourself for the preciousness,’’ she said as we drove into town, passing yoga studios and expensive sandwich shops and a laundromat called the Lost Sock.

It was the late-­afternoon lull, and most everything was shuttered. No one would sell us an expensive sandwich. We bought lemonade and cookies and sat outside a cafe in the strong sun. Immediately, Gaitskill started rehashing our last discussion, irritated by some of my questions. She thought them foolish. She is fluent when forceful, all the hesitation drains from her voice.

I told her I understood. I told her I was sorry. I told her we would have to discuss these things anyway. (I had asked if her book was bleak or happy, and about how her work had been regarded by critics.) She’s right not to want to focus entirely on the reception of her work — but how else could we correct misconceptions? How else could we discuss the life a book leads in the world? Her pique passed. She seemed satisfied, even, it felt to me, soothed that I could — or would — push back, however pleasantly. But I was left unsettled and alert, eating my cookie in large dry gobs. I thought of a line from ‘‘The Mare’’: ‘‘It felt like she was pressing on my weak spot, just to see what would happen.’’

Later, we took her usual route around town, an hourlong walk along main streets and through neighborhoods, today a hive of Saturday-­afternoon activity. Everyone was occupied — even the pair of fat birds we encountered ambling across a lawn; people keep them around, Gaitskill said, because they nibble up the ticks.

Here, unlike in her apartment in Williamsburg, she was completely at home, moving freely, un-­self-­consciously. She settled in the area before she married and lived here on and off for many years. In an interview, she once mentioned the relief the townspeople seemed to take in her engagement: ‘‘Married, you’re basically part of the herd, and that makes life easier in a lot of ways, in terms of social support. But if you’re not by nature a herd animal, you start to feel like you’re passing.’’ In his memoir, ‘‘Another Insane Devotion,’’ Trachtenberg says of Gaitskill: ‘‘I think I have never met anyone more lonely.’’

How do we bridge our solitudes? In Gaitskill’s fiction, people are locked houses, ‘‘private cyclones,’’ doomed to draw near one another, assured of mutual destruction. There’s an old man in a Chekhov story who refers to women fondly, almost reverently, as ‘‘hatchets.’’ It’s a useful metaphor for all of Gaitskill’s characters, for how easily they slice one another open.

In ‘‘Two Girls, Fat and Thin,’’ Dorothy, her loneliest character, stares at women at the gym and wonders, ‘‘What would it be like to hold one of these complexly injured animals in your arms?’’ In ‘‘The Mare,’’ we see the characters start to try. Ginger communicates tenderness first through her hands, as she learns to brush Velvet’s hair. So, too, does Velvet slowly earn her horse’s trust. The horse is ‘‘head-­shy,’’ sensitive of her head, where she had been scarred by a too-tight halter — and Velvet learns how to approach carefully. Before she even rides the horse, she performs a hundred small acts of daily devotion: She mucks out the horse’s stable and grooms her; she washes her between the legs with mint and digs dirt out of her hooves. She learns to pull the horse’s tail just so, so it stretches the spine.

We turned a corner onto an empty meadow, ringed by trees. In the distance was a large, gleaming stable. It’s not Gaitskill’s stable in Tivoli; she rides somewhere else, or she did. The horse she loved was just boarded in town and was moved not long ago by his owner. She said she doesn’t know where he is, or even if he’s alive. He was an old horse. It’s impossible not to number her losses in these years — the children, the marriage, the horse — even her small cat disappeared. In Granta, she wrote about how his disappearance shattered her — she visited psychics, drove around town and scattered clothes around her lawn so the cat might catch her scent and find his way home.

We were walking in the shadow of some trees when Gaitskill spoke of the children for the first time, how in spite of everything they faced, there was such ‘‘loveliness’’ in them, in their ‘‘scent and feel.’’ There was such yearning in these words, I didn’t know where to look. I remembered something she said to me in her kitchen, the first time we met. While working on ‘‘The Mare,’’ she kept repeating a phrase of Nabokov’s — ‘‘the lovely and lovable world which quietly persists.’’ She told me she once saw a film clip of the Sept. 11 attacks; as one of the towers came down, a sea gull passed by where the building had just been, utterly unperturbed. ‘‘I did want to kind of hold on to something lovely and lovable in the book,’’ she said. But the book has also been a way to hold on to what was lovely and lovable in life.

The final scene in ‘‘The Mare’’ features all the novel’s main characters, all of them hatchets, all of them head-­shy, all of them together. What has disbanded in life has been preserved in her fiction, it turns out, and endowed with a kind of immortality. We walked on. I said something to her, and she disagreed. The wind picked up, and the meadow pulsed like a living being.",REAL

For a year or two, I smoked pot out of a chimney-­shaped wooden pipe. It came with a lighter, which was wrapped in a sort of braided-­leather papoose. Papoose and pipe were handmade by a shaman-­like fellow I met on the side of a highway in the Pacific Northwest. His wares were solid, but the smoke was harsh. So, not long ago, I switched to a vaporizer, or ‘‘vape,’’ the Magic-­Flight Launch Box.

Vapes heat marijuana buds to oven temperatures, at which point they release their psychoactive payload and gradually turn brown, without burning. Vapor feels easier on the lungs than smoke. Its effects come on more slowly and gently. But the essential quality of vapes is their discretion. Vapes are the antithesis of iridescent glass pipes and cumbersome bongs. They don’t produce a lingering or pungent odor. They do for cannabis what brown paper bags do for beer and what collars do for dogs; they keep your neighbors from freaking out when you pass them on the sidewalk.

The Launch Box is a wooden block small enough to conceal in the palm of your hand. There is a thumb-­size stainless-­steel trench for the weed, a pea-size hole for the vapor and a larger hole in the side, where you insert a rechargeable battery. The battery completes a circuit, heating the trench. You can just about use the Launch Box in the middle of a conversation and have it be mistaken for coughing or popping a breath mint. Across a restaurant, it’s invisible. One vape reviewer, from the tech blog Gizmodo, criticized the Launch Box for looking as if it were made in shop class. Yes, but so did the Apple I. It does exactly what you need it to do, and nothing more.

Though I’ve since taken it out to state parks, numerous bars, a sculpture garden and a hotel rooftop, the Launch Box spent its first few months at home, in a drawer, a few steps away from my office. Over time, it began making afternoon sojourns to my desk. These sessions took place once a week or so, at times when I needed to compile to-do lists, tidy up or try to untangle some gnarled project.

The inventor of the Magic-Flight Launch Box, Forrest Landry, is also a philosopher. Each vape comes engraved with this aphorism based on his tract ‘‘An Immanent Metaphysics’’: ‘‘Love is that which enables choice. Love is always stronger than fear. Always choose on the basis of love.’’

Marijuana, I found, is a fine office drug. Not only is it more healthful than the ubiquitous conference-­table bottle of Knob Creek, it’s also a sharper creative spur. It makes work feel more like a rapturous Frisbee game, less like an assembly line. Solo brainstorms take on an almost yeast-like generativity. And contrary to popular notions from the end of the last century, much of what bubbles up is worth keeping.

One of the wisest things I’ve read about cannabis was written by an anony­mous ‘‘Mr. X’’ in the 1971 book ‘‘Marihuana Reconsidered.’’ While meticulously cataloging how pot enhanced his life as a 30-­something professional, X wrote that ‘‘the devastating insights achieved when high are real insights.’’ They can survive the state of mind that caused them to arise. The difficulty is how to capture a bit of this precious ore. You will need a notebook and some mental pruning shears, to avoid chasing down every dopamine-­inspired tangent. ‘‘Ten even more interesting ideas or images have to be lost in the effort of recording one,’’ is how X put it.",REAL
Mary Karr Thinks You Shouldn’t Google Yourself,"It seems there is inherent interest in the memoirs of people who have undergone something horrible. But that’s everybody on the planet. People say that as if it’s somehow unseemly to write about traumatic experiences.

Yet, as you point out, memoirs are more popular than ever. We’re crying all the way to the bank.

Your bibliography in the back of the book contains a lot of classics, as well as some best sellers, like Lena Dunham’s ‘‘Not That Kind of Girl.’’ Did you read celebrity memoirs thinking that you might include them on such an august list? It’s a list whose virtue is inclusion. How many great novels were there in the 19th century? Everybody will say there were thousands, but there really weren’t. As for the celebrities I included, I think all those people are real writers. It’s not the Real Housewives, you know? Those are all smart people. Lena Dunham went to Oberlin.

No. Memoirs are not ‘‘Look at my boobs at the party.’’ The ones that I read are works of art meant to last millenniums. I still read St. Augustine.

What’s that experience like for you? Well, obviously, I would like my every portrait to be of me dispensing food to the poor. Believe it or not, I’m actually not that interested in representation of myself in other people’s writing. I’ve also never Googled myself. It wouldn’t occur to me to do so. It’s the same reason I don’t watch pornography. It’s not that I occupy some moral high ground. I just think: Down that road lies madness.

As someone who reveals so much, is there a time that an interviewer has gone too far with you?

The Weaponization of ‘Truther’,"In a technical sense, Trump had truth on his side. George W. Bush was, in fact, the president on Sept. 11, 2001. (As an aside, I was struck by Trump’s curiously authoritarian use of ‘‘reign’’ to describe the tenure of an American president.) Trump did not explicitly assign blame to Bush, or say whether he could have done anything to prevent the attacks. But by raising the matter of blame, Trump was defying yet another truth that Republicans had until that point held to be self-­evident: that W. held no culpability for anything that happened on 9/11.

There was an often-­cited warning in the President’s Daily Brief from August 2001 cautioning that Osama bin Laden was ‘‘determined to strike in U.S.’’ But the general inclination, at least among Republicans, has been to cut Bush slack on this and credit him with ‘‘keeping America safe.’’ Trump’s remark had Bush’s defenders firing up their umbrage machines. ‘‘How pathetic for @realdonaldtrump to criticize the president for 9/11,’’ Jeb Bush tweeted. ‘‘We were attacked & my brother kept us safe.’’ Ari Fleischer, a Bush White House press secretary, took it further, breaking out the heavy er-­tillery, telling CNN: ‘‘When Trump implies that since 9/11 took place on Bush’s watch he is partially responsible for it, he’s starting to sound like a truther,’’ he said. ‘‘And after all, does Donald Trump also think since Pearl Harbor happened on F.D.R.’s watch that F.D.R. is responsible?’’

Trump has always been more associated with ‘‘birthers’’ than ‘‘truthers.’’ ‘‘Birther,’’ of course, is the common ‘‘er’’ reserved for those who believe that President Obama’s birth certificate might be fake, that he was born outside the United States and that his presidency is therefore not legitimate. Trump was a vocal proponent of this view in the 2012 presidential campaign, which he made many loud noises about joining but ultimately did not. His apparent fixation on the cause was enough for many to consign him to the nativist fringe of the Republican Party, or so it seemed. It also contributed enough doubt that it compelled Obama to actually release his long-­form birth certificate at a White House news conference in 2011.

Trump has largely avoided discussing the Obama birth-­certificate issue in this campaign. He is an avowed non­fan of the word ‘‘birther,’’ which he told Politico in 2012 was ‘‘a derogatory term, created by a certain group in the media’’ (he instead called it Obama’s ‘‘place-­of-­birth issue’’). But to this point, trutherism in its original 9/11 sense has never really been Trump’s thing. Fleischer told me that he intentionally used the word ‘‘truther’’ as an epithet. In a sense, he was counterpunching in a classically Trumpian style — floating a notion and letting it hang there to absorb sinister connotations. Trump ‘‘did what people who want to hang dirty innuendos do, which is Donald Trump style,’’ Fleischer said. ‘‘He made the allegation that Bush was somehow to blame, without saying how or why.’’ Fleischer said that Trump did a similar thing recently when he brought up Ben Carson’s Seventh-­day Adventist faith and discussed it in a way that suggested he was confused. ‘‘I just don’t know’’ about Seventh-­day Adventists, Trump said, leaving an information vacuum for sinister thoughts to flourish.

Trump, Fleischer said, was inviting listeners to conflate legitimate questions of Bush’s handling of pre-9/11 intelligence with more easily dismissed (or screwball) notions. ‘‘I’m not going to give Donald Trump the benefit of the doubt about anything he leaves unsaid,’’ he told me. Fleischer is unaligned in the Republican primary race and says he is not a truther or a birther or any kind of ‘‘er’’ except for a ‘‘Fleischer’’ — which he says could refer to someone (like himself) who does not believe recent studies equating the consumption of certain red meats with an increased risk of cancer. ‘‘I don’t buy the bacon stories,’’ Fleischer said. ‘‘That means I’m a Fleischer.’’ Or a ‘‘Flesher.’’

It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when ‘‘truther’’ became so readily weaponized. In debates about previous conspiracy theories, no one used terms like, say, ‘‘Kennedy assassination truther.’’ No one dismissed as ‘‘Elvis truthers’’ those who believed that Elvis Presley remained alive. A recent Rawstory.com headline identified Rage Against the Machine’s bassist, Tim Commerford, as a ‘‘moon-­landing truther,’’ although no one would have used such a term at the time of the actual — or alleged — moon landing.

But after that 2006 Times article, truthers were suddenly everywhere. Subsequent reports — in The Washington Post, Vanity Fair and U.S. News & World Report — all made reference to 9/11 ‘‘truthers,’’ although it took a while for the word to acquire its full-on wacko connotation. In recent years, ‘‘truther’’ has come to have its own totally discrete constellation of evolving meanings and history. Social media, as it tends to do, has accelerated the process.

After NASA recently reported that scientists had found signs of water on Mars, some skeptics dismissed the news as concocted, in the words of Rush Limbaugh, to ‘‘help advance their left-wing agenda on this planet.’’ Newsweek presented these counterarguments under the headline ‘‘Mars Conspiracy ‘Truthers’ React to NASA’s Water Announcement.’’ Vice recently profiled a ‘‘drought truther’’ who maintained that the catastrophic lack of rain in California was caused by ‘‘a secret weather-­control operation orchestrated by the Powers That Be, part of a doomed attempt by government geoengineers to stop global warming.’’ ‘‘Stevie Wonder truthers’’ have questioned whether the singer is in fact blind or is just faking it (for some reason). The foremost Wonder truther, Bomani Jones of ESPN, cited as evidence a guy who claimed to have sold Wonder three TVs. Jones later acknowledged to me, in an interview for this magazine, that his Wonder trutherism was ‘‘a somewhat inappropriate joke that has taken on a life of its own.’’

You can’t help wondering how many sectors of trutherism begin similarly — goofs that spin out of control, to a point at which they are taken quasi-­seriously. The Internet is a supercollider of alternative interpretations — if not realities — and the people who embrace them. People then marginalize those views by calling perpetrators truthers. Things can get very pitched in short order. Every topic — Benghazi, droughts and Mars — becomes a potential battlefield between information and misinformation, truth and truthers.

Trutherism can quickly become stranger than fiction, whatever is which. It becomes a thing, if not a meme. Our individual journeys to truth play out via search engine. You long for a less-­networked, less­-noisy and less-­dismissive community of believers versus skeptics. Or at least I do. Is it me or did conspiracy theorizing and mythmaking used to be so much more fun? I miss the Sasquatch and Area 51 people. ‘‘The truth is out there,’’ as the U.F.O. buffs used to say. And they used to be ‘‘buffs,’’ not ‘‘truthers,’’ in those days of greater innocence and less dismissiveness, before the truthers were out there, too.",REAL
"Sex, Death and Mushrooms","Photo

The forest air is sweet and winy with decay. It’s raining hard. I wipe drops of cold water from the tip of my nose, open an umbrella and ready myself for a walk with my old friend Nick, emeritus professor of the history of science and amateur mycologist. For the last 15 years I’ve accompanied him on autumn mushroom hunts; today we’re visiting Thetford Forest, in Suffolk. Both of us carry trugs, traditional English wooden baskets of willow and sweet chestnut, to hold what we will find. Perhaps tiny fungi with hairlike stalks, or lumpy shelves on the trunks of rotting trees, or pale masses like discarded round pillows, or splayed red starfish arms emerging from the ground.

Hunting for mushrooms can feel surprisingly like hunting animals, particularly if you’re searching for edible species. Looking for chanterelles, I’ve found myself walking on tiptoe across mossy stumps as if they might hear me coming. It’s a bad idea to walk around and try to spot them directly. They have an uncanny ability to hide from the searching eye. Instead, you must alter the way you regard the ground around you, concern yourself with the strange phenomenology of leaf litter and try to give equal attention to all the colors, shapes and angles on the messy forest floor. Once you’ve achieved this relaxed and faintly predatory gaze, brilliant wax-yellow chanterelles often appear from behind leaves and twigs and moss, and now they look quite unlike the false chanterelles growing beside them. Nick says that with enough experience, ‘‘you can reliably tell, at least for the commoner species, what the thing is, even if they are enormously variable, and you could not begin to explain how.’’ He has been an enthusiastic mycologist since his teens and has the names of at least several hundred species committed to memory.

Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of fungi that live as networks called mycelia, made up of tiny branching threads. Some are parasitic, others feed on decaying matter and many are mycorrhizal, growing in and around plant roots and sharing nutrients with their host. Picking a mushroom doesn’t kill the fungus; in a sense, you’re merely plucking a flower from a hidden, thready tangle which may be vast and very ancient: One honey fungus in Oregon covers almost four square miles and is at least 2,400 years old.

Soon Nick and I see scores of mushrooms, set in ragged half-circles, with broad tops that look like cooling milky coffees inexplicably placed among dead leaves. They’re cloud caps, a common species here, and considered toxic. We leave them and walk on. A little while later, Nick spots a yellowish gleam in the long grass. This is more interesting. He crouches beside it, and frowning, pushes a thumb and index finger underneath the specimen and gently pulls it free of moss and grass. ‘‘Tricholoma,’’ he says. ‘‘Tricho­loma sulphureum.’’ Mycologists generally use scientific names to describe fungi, as their common names vary widely. The mushroom he holds is sometimes called the sulfur knight, or the gas agaric. He offers it to me to smell, and an unpleasantly sulfurous tang makes me wrinkle my nose. He puts it in the basket.

I am not very good at identifying fungi, but I am getting better. Over the years I have not only learned to identify a few species by looking at them or smelling them, or seeing what color their cut surfaces turn; I have also become intrigued by the curious place they occupy in our imaginations. We have been foraging and eating mushrooms for millenniums, and they still have the power to disturb us, to conjure the deepest human mysteries of sex and death. Nineteenth-century sensibilities were horrified by the common stinkhorn, a fetid fly-attracting species that bursts out of a membranous egg into a shape perfectly described by its scientific name, Phallus impudicus. In her later years, Charles Darwin’s daughter Henrietta went into the woods to collect stinkhorns for the express purpose of bringing them back to be ‘‘burned in the deepest secrecy of the drawing-room fire, with the door locked; because of the morals of the maids,’’ according to a memoir by her niece. Our continuing pieties about sex are reflected in the way some modern field guides describe the distinctive odor of mushrooms like Inocybes as ‘‘unmentionable’’ or ‘‘disgusting’’ rather than the more accurate ‘‘spermatic.’’",REAL
How Much Can We Spend to Keep Our Dog Alive?,"Here’s a second issue: When will this dog’s life no longer be worth living? One reason people keep going despite substantial suffering is that they have projects and interests that, in the radiant future tense, continue to matter to them. Your dog doesn’t have these. There’s no wooden boat he wants to finish building, no yet-unborn grandchild he yearns to cradle. As for ‘‘putting him through chemo’’: Most dogs tolerate these regimens well, I understand, but alas, there are exceptions.

And it’s easier to deal with discomfort when you know why you’re undergoing it. In the case of human end-of-life decisions, you can ask what someone wants or would have wanted. This question makes no sense for a creature that doesn’t have the concept of death. You’re going to have to decide what to do without his help.

There is, finally, an issue about the role your dog plays in your own life. Does your devotion to this animal’s care — measured not in money but in your attention — involve giving it too much moral weight? In my experience, people who love their pets are perfectly capable of managing their other commitments. They’re not neglecting the fur- and feather-free bipeds in their lives. If your friends don’t care hugely about animals, so be it. You do. No shame whatsoever in that.

My husband is in the habit of returning items that we have owned and used for quite some time for a cash refund or store credit once we no longer need or want them. These are items that do not have a specified useful life and could continue to be used (if we wished) or be sold secondhand or donated. Recent examples are a four-year-old mattress that I found uncomfortable and a shirt that didn’t fit him correctly after he lost weight. In the past, he has also returned things that do have a window of efficacy after they have been fully used (for example, water filters), but I put my foot down and told him that was simply wrong, so he has stopped doing that.

He typically chooses to make large purchases from retailers with generous return policies that he can take advantage of. I am torn by this practice, because it seems to me that if something has served its purpose satisfactorily for a decent amount of time, asking the store to refund money for a used, nondefective product is unethical. However, the stores themselves set the return policies and are free to refuse to give him a refund. Should I continue to look the other way when he starts searching for receipts from several years ago, or do I need to ask him to stop? C. S., Hawaii

You’re embarrassed by your husband’s behavior. I would be, too. But it’s not so easy to say why. These corporations have chosen to make these policies; he’s choosing to take advantage of them. There are, it seems, only consenting adults here.

Of course, we could apply the old test and ask, ‘‘What would happen if everybody did that?’’ Immanuel Kant famously made a philosophical theory out of this idea. But when we’re certain everybody won’t do it, it’s not clear how much the answer matters. What would happen if everybody whistled Dixie right now? Who cares?

Still, there is something a little unsavory here, isn’t there? The reason he is not doing much harm — and not drawing attention from the sellers — is that almost everybody else is rightly interpreting the return policies as intended for defective goods or occasional buyer’s remorse. In effect, he is exploiting the other customers’ good faith. Ethics can involve questions about duties and consequences. But it also involves questions about what kind of person you are. In the too-familiar formula: Do you really want to be that guy?

There are all sorts of ways in which someone can be a free-rider on a larger culture of trust. Breezing past the ‘‘recommended donation’’ booth at the museum door. Occupying a diner seat for hours with one cup of coffee, and then not tipping the waiter. Marrying for the wedding presents. These actions don’t entail a breach of duty or do much direct harm, but we think of them as antisocial for a reason. You’ve been looking the other way; there’s a good case for looking askance.",REAL
Judge John Hodgman on Rhymes With ‘Rock’,"Photo

Lori writes: During a family game night, my husband drew a card that said, ‘‘Find two things that rhyme with ‘rock.’ ’’ He searched the house and returned with a sock and a tube of caulk. I immediately disputed the caulk, but he insisted it rhymes, shouting a mispronunciation of the word over and over in front of our 9-year-old.

According to Merriam-Webster’s, the words are certainly pronounced differently. But rhyming is more subjective. Your husband might get away with rhyming ‘‘rock’’ with ‘‘caulk’’ in a rap song, but it would sound terrible — and besides, home-renovation rap is really out of style. You are right — not merely because he is wrong, but because he is a provocateur. You’re telling me this dude found caulk before he could find a clock, a crock or a block? He knew what he was doing.",REAL
A Slice of Heaven in Pittsburgh,"But he couldn’t shake his obsession. While living in Charlottesville, Va., he began baking with a friend, working 36 hours straight with the occasional 15-minute nap in order to produce enough bread to sell. When that business fell apart, Easton did some ‘‘pretty intensive home-baking,’’ he recalls, while running an illegal restaurant out of his house to make ends meet. Even then, ‘‘bread was always the center of the table,’’ he says.

He decided to return to his hometown, Pittsburgh, a place where he could open a bakery on a budget. Last year, he raised enough money to open Bread and Salt, which is tucked in the back of a nondescript parking lot off Pearl Street in the Bloomfield neighborhood, also called Little Italy for reasons that are no longer apparent. The space cost $62,000 to build out and is, Easton says, ‘‘in a former slaughterhouse turned butcher shop turned terrible pizzeria turned abandoned turned bakery.’’ And that’s exactly how it looks: a funky, beat-up, badly lit, concrete-floored bakery and pizzeria where the owner sits and drinks espresso with friends during breaks in frantic 18-hour bouts with dough and a quadruple-decker oven. It doesn’t look like a place that turns out stuff you’d kill for, but no one ever said cooking had to be fancy.

Easton had cooked in wood-fired ovens before, but here all he could afford was gas. So he asked himself, ‘‘What can I do with a lower temperature?’’ Having obsessively eaten his way through Rome, he knew one answer. Easton’s Roman-style pizza is chewy, crusty, slightly and beautifully sour. (He uses a sourdough starter at the bakery; working together, we adapted his recipe to use yeast.) Neapolitans might not deign to call this pizza, but a friend calls it ‘‘grandma pizza,’’ and that’s really spot on: It’s rectangular and made in a pan, without any special equipment or ingredients.

‘‘There’s room for way more creativity this way,’’ Easton says. ‘‘I can make pizzas that are an expression of this place and its agriculture and change with the seasons.’’ He is using flour made from wheat grown and milled in Pennsylvania, and mostly local vegetables (half the year, anyway). You can get some sense of this in the variations Easton is offering here; I specifically asked him to focus on fall and winter toppings.

I spent a day at Bread and Salt in September and then experimented to make sure the method would work well in a home kitchen. The technique takes a while but is largely unattended; you can start it on the morning of Day 1 and finish it for dinner — or even lunch — on Day 2, and have pretty much whatever passes for your normal life in the meantime. For all but the most experienced home bread makers, the dough will be a surprise; it’s about 80 percent water by weight. For that reason, handling it can be messy, especially at first, but as long as you wet your hands, it’s not too difficult.

In fact, the whole thing is pretty simple. What you end up with is a pizza that can be served out of the oven, at room temperature or even reheated. (Easton often reheats the pies with a second layer of toppings.) I have probably eaten this pizza with a dozen different toppings over the past couple of months. I’d happily make any of them again, but I’m too busy experimenting with new ones.

This will be my last Eat column. When I started writing it, I never would have guessed that it would end in Pittsburgh. That it does confirms that good food here is hardly limited to a couple of smug metropolitan areas, and validates my feeling that cooking in the United States is as interesting as it is anywhere in the world. That change began some time ago, but it has accelerated in the past five years and will only continue. I’m glad to have been able to witness it.

A Long Engagement,"But he was able, with time, to become instrumental in Karen affairs. Along with other indigenous peoples there, the Karen had long been fighting the government’s oppressive actions against minorities, and in the late ’90s, after Stephen immigrated to the United States, he and my mother began working closely in the push for human rights and democratic governance. She trusted Stephen’s opinion more than anyone’s. He often referred to her as his teacher, and she teased and worried over him as if he were a son. Still, during these years, I never developed more than an acquaintance with him. He was based in Seattle, and I was consumed with my own life in Southern California — education, work, marriage and parenthood.

It was after my mother died in 2010 that I reached out to him on the phone. Our early conversations centered on the person we missed, but when a new, nominally civilian government made gestures toward a more open society, Stephen began to talk with me about the issues involved. The cause that had unified him and my mother brought us closer, and in 2012, he asked if I would attend the Karen congress with him.

When I arrived late at night in a Thai village across the Salween from Karen headquarters, he was sleeping. We hadn’t seen each other since my mother’s memorial service, and after all that time on the phone, I’d almost forgotten his paralysis. Now when I walked into the room, I was stunned to see how helpless he looked, as if fastened to the bed, and I found myself rushing to this man I’d never touched and falling down into his arms.

At the time, I could no more stop my tears than explain them. Today, on the eve of the first general elections in the country in decades, it seems to me that I was reacting to the tremendous toll that his personal and political struggles had taken on him. I must have been reminded also of my mother, who had been similarly confined to her bed during her illness, and whose death had cost us a heroine. It occurs to me now how vulnerable Stephen and I were, how dependent on each other. Even to get out of bed, Stephen would need my help. And I needed the comfort that perhaps only he, with all our unrealized history, could give. He seemed to understand all of this, and he stroked the back of my head.

At the end of our trip, we stayed a night at his cousin’s place, a concrete structure filled with guests, in Mae Sot, Thailand. The cousin was away, but a sweet woman Stephen knew showed up with dinner. She sat in the kitchen while we ate, re-emerging to knead Stephen’s shoulders before wheeling him into the bathroom to prepare him for sleep. A nurse with two daughters, she had trained hundreds of other nurses serving the nearby refugee camps. ‘‘Whenever I come through, she takes care of me,’’ Stephen explained later, from a bed alongside mine. Then he let on that she was the young woman he saved long ago on the Salween. ‘‘Look at all she’s done,’’ he said, with the tenderness I’ve come to rely on. ‘‘Tell me it wasn’t worth it.’’",REAL
How to Make a Time Capsule,"Photo

‘‘Be anti-tech when it comes to what you put inside,’’ says William E. Jarvis, a founder of the International Time Capsule Society. You don’t want your message to the future formatted irretrievably on an obsolete technology like a floppy disk. Include stable items that will not damage everything else by corroding (electronics), exploding (beer bottles) or decomposing (flora and fauna). Put in objects that show evidence of human touch. ‘‘Suppose you wanted to include a book of erotica,’’ Jarvis says. ‘‘Make it a used one, so that the person who finds it can tell which pages have been thumbed more.’’

Record on the vessel itself the date you want your capsule opened. A coffee can might last 10 years; an airtight, stainless-­steel container should be used if your time frame is longer. Pump the receptacle full of inert argon gas to enhance preservation if you want it to be sealed for a century or more. Jarvis is resigned to the prevailing desire to bury capsules, though he disapproves. ‘‘Underground, they tend to fill with water,’’ he says. If you must bury them, he recommends places that aren’t likely to be built over, like the edges of a national park or historic site. But make sure to leave locational evidence: a marker atop your site, or an article in your local newspaper, or GPS coordinates written into your will. ‘‘People are always losing their time capsules,’’ Jarvis says.

In addition to curios and coins, include a letter — preferably in permanent ink on acid-­free paper, slipped into a protective plastic sleeve — with a bit of what Jarvis calls ‘‘social criticism of your own era’’ and your hopes for the future. A heartfelt attempt at connection across time doesn’t need the passage of a thousand years to become a valuable illumination of a historical moment. In 2012, Russian workers repairing a statue of Lenin unearthed a time capsule with a letter from a Soviet youth group from 1979. It reads, in part: ‘‘Let your character be courageous. Let your songs be happier. Let your love be hotter. We do not feel sorry for ourselves, because we are certain you will be better than us.’’",REAL

RE: ANNA STUBBLEFIELD

Daniel Engber wrote about the strange case of Anna Stubblefield, a professor of ethics at Rutgers who was convicted of sexual assault. The victim was a young man with severe cerebral palsy, D.J., who she said could communicate through a controversial method called ‘‘facilitated communication.’’

The story of Anna Stubblefield is the story of a fanatic, of one whose zealous devotion to her beliefs about racism and ableism have blinded her to the tenets of responsible adult behavior. Even if facilitated communication is a helpful approach to treating imprisoned speech, and even if every word she attributes to the man called D.J. is absolutely accurate (which I doubt), she still has the same responsibility to him that a psychologist or a doctor has to his or her patient or that a teacher has to his or her student. She has to know the meaning and implications of transference and has to understand that any emotional attachments formed during treatment or instruction are fraught with danger to both the treatment and the patient or student. As an ethics professor, she has to accept, moreover, her responsibility to behave correctly, to reject the love myth in favor of the health of her patient. Janet Hubbs, Brielle, N.J.

By incarcerating Anna Stubblefield, society is being denied a terribly important practitioner who turns unproductive members of society into productive and even happy humans, who just might turn around and help others in similar positions. Domino theory? Sure.

At no time did Stubblefield break any law. Did she do something unusual by developing a personal relationship with one of her many clients — a person with whom she worked so successfully for several years and whose life she totally changed?

We were appalled at the words on the cover of the magazine describing D.J. as having the ‘‘mental capacity of a toddler.’’ We find such descriptions inaccurate, unhelpful and demeaning. Because he does not have a reliable means to speak, it is presumed that he cannot think. The cover did a disservice to the man, the case and the article itself, by disregarding the disputed interpretations of this man’s cognitive processing that lay at the heart of the matter.

The capacity of any individual can never be fully known, nor should the breadth of a human life be reduced to a single dimension, like a score on an I.Q. test. It is not a coincidence that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (Article 12) calls for the recognition of the legal capacity of all individuals with disabilities and for them to be considered equal persons under the law. When we use descriptions that fail to presume such capacity, we disallow D.J. from experiencing his humanity and exercising self-determination. Srikala Naraian and Celia Oyler, New York

RE: BAMBA

Marnie Hanel recommended a peanut-flavored Israeli snack, Bamba, as a way to possibly inoculate children against peanut allergies.

Photo

I recognize that Marnie Hanel’s Letter of Recommendation for Bamba does a service to readers in bringing attention to new medical advice: that babies should be exposed to peanuts sooner rather than later in order to reduce the risk of allergies. However, as the mother of two children, one with multiple food allergies, I wish the piece hadn’t been so tone-deaf to the fact that although her concerns that her own son would exhibit a peanut allergy proved unfounded, others of us aren’t as lucky. I was troubled by Hanel’s fond description of her son’s excitement when she breaks out a Bamba bag ‘‘in the library or on an airplane.’’ If I were in the children’s section of a library with my 4-year-old and saw a toddler eating a powdery, crumbly peanut snack, we would probably leave the area; on an airplane, we wouldn’t have the option. And yet in spite of the fact that my family seems to have found itself inside Hanel’s nightmare — and I admit that I actually envy parents whose children are allergic ‘‘only’’ to peanuts — I feel compelled to point out that even with allergies, my family’s life still contains much of the pleasure she celebrates in her own. Curtis Sittenfeld, St. Louis",REAL
The Archive of Eating,"One day, she found herself trying to get her head around an excess of confusingly similar yet distinct medieval blancmange recipes in four languages. Blancmange — which means ‘‘white food’’ — referred to a family of recipes in which pale mixtures were casseroled together into a pap, often with rice and almond milk. There were blancmanges of lobster and capon; of pike, carp and haddock. Wheaton sketched out a table representing different blancmange recipes on a piece of three-ring notebook paper and found that she could make sense of them only ‘‘as long as I kept staring at the paper.’’ She moved on to French cookbooks of the 17th and 18th centuries and tried to organize the data they contained by taking notes on each recipe one by one. But when she returned to these notes, she was frustrated. She couldn’t grasp the character of the books.

In the 1970s Wheaton discovered McBee cards. They were a primitive data system, in which different pieces of information could be encoded by punching holes to designate broad categories (date, gender, country). ‘‘After the cards are properly punched, whole packs of them can be searched by running a knitting needle through the desired hole in the pack and lifting it up,’’ Wheaton explained in a talk last summer at a food symposium held at Oxford. ‘‘When, if one is lucky, gems of information will drop out.’’ McBee cards had obvious limitations, however. ‘‘My categories kept expanding, and the cards did not.’’ Wheaton tried to improve the cards by adding color-coded edges, but then she ran out of colors.

Slide Show

In 1982, Wheaton set aside her knitting needles and switched to computers, buying the first IBM PC, which could produce accented letters. (‘‘Apple scorned such frippery,’’ Wheaton said. ‘‘I believe they thought accented letters were like ice cream cones with sprinkles.’’) After using and abandoning two database programs, she settled on Microsoft Access and has been using it ever since. ‘‘It is possible to search for fungi or for morels, and to search for courgettes and also get zucchini,’’ she said. It’s Wheaton’s hope that someday a friendly library or other research institution will take on the database and make it open for everyone to search.

I asked her if she ever lost herself in all the data. ‘‘Oh, yes, oh, yes!’’ she exclaimed, her voice almost purring. She likes to describe her database as ‘‘a cross between a Swiss Army knife and a piano.’’ It can do all sorts of handy little jobs, but it can also produce music. The music is the patterns it reveals about the vast human enterprise of cooking.

When Wheaton mailed me the database on a flash drive, I couldn’t wait to start playing with it. And sure enough, I found a storeroom brimming with secrets. You can identify long-forgotten passions, like a brief 18th-century vogue for coffee-flavored waffles, and discover the moments that many of our basic cooking methods started. You might find the first time any cookbook in the collection mentions chocolate as an ingredient rather than a drink (for the record, it’s Massialot’s ‘‘Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois,’’ 1691) or the earliest recipe for a basic roux sauce (La Varenne, 1651). But, like a long-handled skimmer reaching deep into the historic cooking pot, ‘‘The Cook’s Oracle’’ can fish out foodways so obsolete no one today even knows to mourn them.

It can haul up such forgotten delicacies as artificial asses’ milk (fake donkey milk, a health food made from rose jam, candy and sea holly) or tansy, a bitter herb that was once used in desserts, like our vanilla extract. Or pulpatoon, a ragout made of an excess of ingredients including pigeons, mushrooms and pistachio nuts. Or what about asparagus chopped small, to disguise it as green peas? No one would attempt this trick now that peas come cheap from the freezer.

Some of the delightful morsels prompt the thought: Why did we stop regularly cooking that? The globe artichoke, for instance. Across Europe, cooks of the 16th to the 18th centuries recognized this ornate vegetable for a great treat. The DB lists multiple iterations of artichoke pie, lavishly layered with truffles. Artichokes were boiled, braised or fried; served in a cream sauce; or simply cooked and dressed and eaten leaf by delicious leaf. Outside Italy, artichokes no longer inspire such intense worship, and our eating is the poorer for it. They belong to a more civilized, less puritanical way of life, demanding to be savored slowly, possibly with large quantities of butter.

You will look in vain here for cilantro or feta. Instead, you’ll find mutton: page after page of mutton recipes, from chops to hash to jelly to mutton broth for the sick. Croissants are present, but only in the recipes from France. There is a single American avocado recipe, from 1887 (for a salad with mayonnaise and onions), but the fruit is called ‘‘alligator pear.’’ The recipe’s author, Maria Parloa, assumes it is so rare we need to be told where to buy one (at a store on Fulton Street in New York, she suggests, where they cost 15 to 20 cents apiece, or around $4 to $5 in today’s money). You start to see that so much of what we think of as personal taste is really a question of what’s available in any given market. To be an avocado eater in 1887 was as eccentric a proclivity as being a mutton lover today.

Scenes of kitchens very unlike ours materialize, full of strange utensils like salamanders (long-handled tools for broiling), croquette molds and fluted knives for cutting root vegetables into fancy shapes. There are unusual cooking methods, like in an 18th-century recipe for beefsteak panbroiled over a fire made from two newspapers. Without kitchen timers or thermometers, the DB’s cooks were often forced to be ingenious in measuring when a dish was done: ‘‘until the bones are ready to fall out,’’ ‘‘until you can run a straw into the skin,’’ until ‘‘the milk tastes of spice,’’ ‘‘till it be soft and limber.’’ They used their senses more acutely than we do.

The more fragments Wheaton collects, the more cookbooks reveal their variety, and also their mystery. There is no universal cookbook, only a tower of Babel where no cook fully speaks the language of any other. However imperfectly, the database helps decode these fragmentary snatches of dialogue: not just the ingredients of the soup, or the pot it was cooked in, but also the values of the person who prepared it. ‘‘I had to learn to listen to the writer’s side of the conversation with his or her reader,’’ Wheaton says.

Photo

This is sometimes hard, because the assumptions of cooks in the past were so utterly different from our own. An American cookbook from 1881 includes many recipes for marble cake, but almost no verbs, because the authors assumed that the method for marbling batter was common knowledge. Amelia Simmons, in 1796, imagines that we will have a cow on hand that we can milk straight into a dish of cider and sugar to make a syllabub, a frothy dessert: ‘‘milk your cow into your liquor’’ she calmly directs, as if it were something normal — and for her, it was.

When she got started on her database, Wheaton was driven by a love of good meals. She wanted to reconstruct some of the delicious things of the past, the ‘‘overflowing generosity.’’ She collected French recipes — most of them by male chefs — for pistachio turnovers and marzipan tarts, for salmon with herbs and oranges glazed with caramel. But as time went on, she saw that many of the authors she had gathered up in ‘‘The Cook’s Oracle’’ were leading bleak lives of deprivation, in which cooking was not a leisure pursuit but a way to survive.

Today, the vulnerability is precisely what interests Wheaton. She herself grew up in an affluent family on the outskirts of Philadelphia — there was a fine kitchen garden and a cook — but her grandfather came from a family of poverty-stricken farmers. Even though he went on to become a successful businessman, he kept the habits of scarcity. He saved. He mended furniture. ‘‘He understood people who didn’t have any money,’’ she told me. She began using cookbooks to reconstruct people’s lives, ‘‘even if they weren’t wonderful.’’

One of the more startling patterns is the difference between cookbooks written by men and women before the 20th century. Wheaton says she has come to see them as almost two separate cuisines. Male chefs — who had professional status — were mainly concerned with how to satisfy a master’s jaded palate. It was said that ancien régime French chefs aspired to give fish the flavor of meat, meat the flavor of fish and vegetables no flavor at all. Robert May in ‘‘The Accomplisht Cook’’ (1660) urges his readers to use only the best: ‘‘fine flour,’’ ‘‘good thick sweet cream,’’ ‘‘handsome’’ fishes. By contrast, the women’s books are much humbler. They include such compromises as ‘‘cheap rice pudding’’ and ‘‘cheaper fruitcake.’’ These are books about what to do when life gives you lemons — or when it gives you mediocre ingredients and limited time. The female authors assume that their readers, who are servants or wives, will be managing the cooking alongside other household tasks like the laundry and child care. Their recipes often display a brutal pragmatism. Mrs. Randolph’s ‘‘The Virginia Housewife’’ (1824) has a recipe for chicken soup — soup of ‘‘old fowl’’ — that starts with keeping the bird in a coop for two weeks before killing it and chopping it up, discarding the back because it is ‘‘too gross and strong for use.’’

Photo

One of Wheaton’s favorite books in the DB is ‘‘The Frugal Housewife,’’ first published in 1829 (later editions added ‘‘American’’ to the title). The writer was Lydia Maria Child, who was also a campaigner against slavery and for women’s rights. Child’s cookbook, Wheaton said, is a ‘‘slice of life as lived by unprosperous New Englanders in the 1820s and ’30s.’’ Some of her recipes remain appealing, like her simple dish of tomatoes stewed with butter and salt. But the book as a whole is pervaded with penny-pinching. The best economy with coffee, Child advises, is to ‘‘go without.’’ Child commends cupcakes, not because she likes them — no ‘‘Sex and the City’’-style indulgence here — but because they are less expensive than poundcake. She recommends asking friends in the country to buy lard for us when it is cheapest. ‘‘Economical people,’’ writes Child, ‘‘will seldom use preserves, except for sickness.’’ The entire book contains almost no seasonings.

Lydia Child was helping her readers envisage a life of financial security, in which, with a little resourcefulness, the lard would not run out. When Wheaton teaches a seminar on how to read a cookbook, she always uses ‘‘The Frugal Housewife,’’ and people ‘‘almost always dislike it.’’ We do not recognize ourselves in Child’s remedies. For many of us, stressed by work, the impossible dream is not to eat preserves but to switch off the screen long enough to make them. We clip ever more recipes: our own personal database, talismans of a more leisurely existence. As Wheaton has found, the urge to read cookbooks is not always the same as the urge to cook.

Food books touch more of human life than what happens at the stove. The first cookbooks were sometimes called books of secrets, in which remedies for toothache or the plague jostled with recipes for roast meats, puddings and tarts. When I typed ‘‘easy’’ into the database, it offered me not just an easy crust for family pies but also an easy way to make ink and a method for trying to encourage an easy childbirth. (For the latter, E. Smith in 1727 recommended a concoction of raisins, figs, licorice and anise seeds boiled in spring water, imbibed morning and evening six weeks before the baby is due.)

Cookbook readers today would be disconcerted to be offered a cure for deafness or ‘‘fumes in the head’’ alongside instructions for puff pastry. Yet recipes are all still remedies in some form or other — everyday enchantments for making life better. Cookbooks show us at our most defenseless because they expose things we believe we lack: meringues that don’t fall; soup that will fill us up without making us fat; dinners that cook in no time at all. They allow us to imagine ourselves as bountiful hosts or artisanal pastry makers. It isn’t all fantasy, though. Cookbooks also speak to, and soothe, something real: the hunger that started when we were babies, when food and security were one and the same.

The nature of Wheaton’s database is that it can never be finished, at least not by one octogenarian working alone. Even if she were to go well beyond the 3,400 books by more than 6,000 authors that she has already cataloged, the project would comprise merely the edge of a vast hinterland that we can never access: the billions of unremarked bowls of stew, the bakers who toiled alone, the long-vanished food markets. Most cooks, especially female ones, have been illiterate, unable to record their kitchen experience. Wheaton has found just nine surviving Italian cookbooks by women from before 1900. It is as if all those nonnas rolling gnocchi and cutting tagliatelle never existed. The books she is collecting in her database are all that remain of the vast human conversation about food. All we can do is gather up the fragments and try to decipher what comforts they once held.

A few weeks ago, I got a new cookbook by Nigel Slater, ‘‘A Year of Good Eating.’’ I can’t pretend I needed it, though it does look lovely on the kitchen shelf in its calm blue cover. So far, I’ve cooked only one of the recipes, for hazelnut-maple cookies, though I have my eye on many more, if I can only find the time: a dish of wet polenta and winter greens, a piece of cod crusted with pumpkin seeds and dill. It makes me feel oddly reassured to have all this kitchen wisdom stored up, like jars of jelly in a pantry. Recipes can feel like charms against life’s disappointments or protection against the onward march of the years. You never know exactly when they will be called for.",REAL
Edna Lewis and the Black Roots of American Cooking,"Along the way, fried chicken has become a fraught food, somehow both universally beloved and also used in ugly stereotypes of black people. But Lewis treated all the food she prepared, perhaps all things she did, with dignity and sensitivity. You get this sense in photos of her: She always stood tall, often dressed in clothes made of African fabrics, her white hair crowning her head. Almost everyone who met her describes her as ‘‘regal.’’ It’s almost as if her parents knew, when they gave her the middle name Regina.

Lewis went on from Freetown to become a revered chef and cookbook author, a friend to literati and movie stars and the winner of nearly every award our culinary institutions had to give. Today, her name is revered among food-world cognoscenti but less well known than your average Food Network star, and yet her championing of Southern food, and cooking it close to the land, is more relevant than ever. ‘‘We weren’t ready for her then,’’ one of her acolytes, Alice Waters, says. ‘‘Now we are.’’

‘‘Our mother was an excellent cook,’’ Lewis’s younger sister, Ruth Lewis Smith, told me recently. ‘‘Our Aunt Jennie was an excellent cook. A lot of our family went to Washington, D.C., to work as cooks. When they came home, they all learned from each other.’’ The elite homes of Virginia, going back to the days when the Colonial elite socialized with French politicians and generals during the Revolutionary War, dined on a cuisine inspired by France. It was built on local ingredients — many originally shared by Native Americans or brought by slaves from Africa — and developed by enslaved black chefs like James Hemings, who cooked for Thomas Jefferson at Monticello. Because this aristocratic strain of Southern cuisine was provisioned and cooked largely by black people, it came into their communities as well, including Freetown. Smith is 91 and still raises chickens; a cage of quail coo in her kitchen. When I called her, she asked me to call back later because her apple butter had been on the stove for two days, and it was ready for canning.

As a girl, Lewis busied herself with gathering berries, sewing and other home-taught skills. She watched the older women intently, learning to cook alongside them. After leaving Freetown, she made her way to New York City, where she took a job at a laundry and was fired three hours later: She’d never ironed before. She became a Communist and bristled at having to enter employers’ buildings through the back door but nonetheless worked for a time as a domestic, helping to put her baby sister Naomi through art school. At one point, she became a sought-after seamstress, making dresses for Doe Avedon and Marilyn Monroe, and dressing windows for the high-end department store Bonwit Teller. Surrounded by bohemians and fashion figures, she gave dinner parties for her friends, channeling her memories of her mother and aunt at the stove.

In 1948, Johnny Nicholson, a regular at Lewis’s table, was getting ready to open a cafe on the Upper East Side. As Nicholson used to tell it, Lewis walked by, about to take another job as a domestic, when she looked into her friend’s place and said it would make a terrific restaurant. A week later, Lewis was cooking lunch at Cafe Nicholson. She offered a tidy menu: herbed roast chicken, filet mignon, a piece of fish, some cake, a chocolate soufflé. The restaurant was a smash. It had a dining room like a fabulist’s dream: floral displays and soaring palm fronds dipping down to kiss the heads of guests like Paul Robeson, Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal. Truman Capote would come into the kitchen, purring at his new friend Edna for a fix of biscuits. William Faulkner once flattered Lewis by asking if she had studied cooking in Paris. But no, her sister Ruth Lewis Smith told me: She learned to make soufflés from their mother, back in Virginia. Smith, in fact, often made them herself, after the restaurant took off and she came to help out.

The restaurant critic Clementine Paddleford reviewed the restaurant in 1951 in The New York Herald Tribune, calling that soufflé ‘‘light as a dandelion seed in a wind’’ and noting a sense of pride in the chef: ‘‘We saw Edna peering in from the kitchen, just to see the effect on the guests and hear the echoes of praise.’’ But Lewis wasn’t just the chef. With Jim Crow in full effect and de facto segregation the reality in most of the North, this granddaughter of slaves had become a partner in a business that counted Eleanor Roosevelt among its favorite customers.

In 1961, Judith Jones, an editor at Knopf, ushered in an era of fascination with French cuisine by publishing an intensely detailed cookbook called ‘‘Mastering the Art of French Cooking,’’ written in part by a tall, warbling woman named Julia Child. A decade later, Jones was looking for someone to help America turn its sights to the glories of its own tables. One day, the chief executive of Random House, Knopf’s parent company, asked Jones if she would meet his friend, a socialite named Evangeline Peterson. Peterson had taken a liking to a wonderful caterer and wanted to write down her recipes. Unsure of what the meeting would yield, Jones agreed to it. ‘‘But when Edna swept into my office, in this beautiful garb, her hair piled up, she was just such a presence that you were a little awed by her,’’ she says.

After leaving Cafe Nicholson in the mid-1950s, Lewis had continued her cinematically eclectic life. She and her husband, a Communist activist named Steve Kingston, spent time as pheasant farmers in New Jersey, until all the birds died overnight from a mysterious disease. She opened and closed her own restaurant. She began catering and teaching cooking classes and took a job as a docent in the Hall of African Peoples in the American Museum of Natural History. A slip on a snowy night broke her ankle and, bored during her recovery, she accepted Peterson’s invitation to write together.

They had essentially finished writing a book, ­‘‘The Edna Lewis Cookbook,’’ that Jones thought was fashionable but characterless. But when Lewis started talking, recalling scenes of growing up in Freetown and the foods they had gathered, grown, harvested, shot, hooked and cooked, Jones lit up. ‘‘I knew this was a voice that could teach us,’’ she said. This was the story of American food that she had wanted to hear. Peterson graciously went home, Jones asked questions, Lewis wrote answers on yellow legal pads and the seeds of her classic, ‘‘The Taste of Country Cooking,’’ were sown. Lewis would go on to write more books and to hold chef posts at esteemed landmarks like Middleton Place in South Carolina and Gage & Tollner in New York. But she will be forever remembered for writing the book that started with that meeting.

‘‘The Taste of Country Cooking,’’ published in 1976, is revered for the way it shows the simple beauty of food honestly made in the rhythm of the seasons — the now common but at the time nearly forgotten ethos of eating farm-to-table — and for the way it gave a view of Southern food that was refined and nuanced, going beyond grease, greens and grits. ‘‘Until recently, we Southerners were very apologetic about our food,’’ Lewis’s friend, collaborator and eventual caretaker Scott Peacock told me. ‘‘But she wrote about it with such reverence.’’ She inspired generations of Southern cooks to honor their own roots. Alice Waters, who is usually credited for sparking the American organic-and-local movement at Chez Panisse in California, says: ‘‘It was certainly revolutionary at that point. I was such a Francophile, but when I discovered her cookbook, it felt like a terribly good friend. By then, we were already in a fast-food world, and she showed the deep roots of gastronomy in the United States and that they were really in the South, where we grew for flavor and cooked with sophistication. I had never really considered Southern food before, but I learned from her that it’s completely connected to nature, totally in time and place.’’

The book is, in one sense, a country manual, with instructions on picking wild mushrooms and the best way to turn dandelions into wine. (It tastes like Drambuie, Lewis offers helpfully.) It’s also a cookbook, because there are teaspoons and tablespoons and ‘‘cook uncovered for 10 minutes.’’ But perhaps the truest way to describe the book is as a memoir told in recipes, where every menu, dish and ingredient speaks to her childhood in rural Virginia and how her community made a life from the land, taking pleasure in the doing of many things.

It stands as an exemplar of American food writing, a complex, multilayered, artistic and even subtly subversive document. And it stands on the other side of a cruel tradition in cookbooks from the first half of the 20th century, one in which black domestic cooks often had their recipes recorded and written by their white employers, who tended not to flatter the help in the process. Toni Tipton-Martin’s 2015 book ‘‘The Jemima Code,’’ a bibliography of African-American cookbooks, collects some examples of this, including one from 1937 called ‘‘Emma Jane’s Souvenir Cookbook,’’ by Blanche Elbert Moncure. In the equivalent of blackface dialect, a servant cook, Emma Jane, ostensibly says, ‘‘I ain’t no fancy cake maker but here is a re-ceet dat ‘Ole Miss’ taught me,’’ then goes on to give the cake a name involving both a racial slur and an insult to her own intelligence.

Lewis is a sensitive, even-toned renderer of beauty. Her small stories in ‘‘The Taste of Country Cooking’’ gently urge the reader toward a life of mindfulness, a life of learning to see the details. Early in the book, she describes a spring morning: ‘‘A stream, filled from the melted snows of winter, would flow quietly by us, gurgling softly and gently pulling the leaf of a fern that hung lazily from the side of its bank. After moments of complete exhilaration we would return joyfully to the house for breakfast.’’ As Jones once said on a panel, ‘‘You felt all through her writing that she was giving thanks for something precious.’’

In a passage called ‘‘Hog Killing,’’ Lewis recalls the day each fall when her family would turn pigs into pork. It’s not gruesome, but it is earthy. Today, at a time when the phrase ‘‘rock-star butchers’’ has occasion to exist, making us reckon with the mortal reality of meat isn’t so shocking. But it’s still grounding to read these lines: ‘‘My father would remove the liver and the bladder, which he would present to us. We would blow the bladders up with straws cut from reeds and hang them in the house to dry. By Christmas they would have turned transparent like beautiful balloons.’’ Can you imagine being so intimately connected to the guts of life that you could look at a bladder, just separated from its pig, and see a balloon for your Christmas tree? Can you imagine seeing so much to love around you?

But those same hogs also point toward deeper meaning in the text. The next paragraph reads: ‘‘The following morning my brothers and sisters and I would rush out before breakfast to see the hogs hanging from the scaffolds like giant statues. The hogs looked beautiful. They were glistening white inside with their lining of fat, and their skin was almost translucent.’’

In November 1918, two years after Lewis was born, a black man, Charles Allie Thompson was lynched in Culpeper, a nearby town. A mob hung him from a tree after claims that he raped a white woman. He had been seen asking her to help with butchering, at hog-killing time. It’s not clear whether Lewis knew this story. But she was not naïve. ‘‘She could see the ugly in the world,’’ Peacock says. ‘‘This is someone who had street smarts.’’ She wrote ‘‘The Taste of Country Cooking’’ while in her 50s, in the 1970s, after years as a political radical, after the civil rights movement, after marching for the Scottsboro Boys, nine black teenagers accused of raping two white women, who escaped being lynched in Alabama in 1931 only to be railroaded into shoddy convictions. (They were all eventually pardoned or had their convictions overturned, some posthumously.) Whether Lewis intended to imbue her hog-killing scene with such references, it became impossible for me to read ‘‘The Taste of Country Cooking’’ without a sense of the wider setting of her story and how she chose to tell it without terror, how she refused to let the past, her past, be defined by anyone else but her.

If someone handed you a book about a settlement of freed slaves trying to live off the land, what would you expect? A story of struggle, at least. Privation and desperation, probably. But in Lewis’s telling, it is a story of peace and celebration, of receiving the gifts of the earth and hard work. The children sing at concerts in this story. The recipes are arranged by menus with formal titles as literally quotidian as ‘‘A Late Spring Dinner’’ or ‘‘A Cool-Evening Supper,’’ because the very acts of cooking and serving and eating food are worthy of occasion. It is a story of refinement, not in the fine-china sense but in the sense of being meticulous and careful about the way the people of Freetown raised and grew and trapped and foraged and prepared their food, because their lives were worth that. The pleasure of that was due them.",REAL
"Betty Crocker’s Absurd, Gorgeous Atomic-Age Creations","One of the most dizzying of these effects is the dominance of circles. Ringed or round connoted nature tamed. The vegetables that survived the cleansing were united by two qualities. They were round and cute: button mushrooms, olives, cherry tomatoes, pearl onions, peas, invincible iceberg. (Celery, long and tubular, made it through, too, I think because it is so neat. And so crisp and orderly.) As food production was mechanized, there followed a march of finished foods made round: cocktail franks, meatballs, cheese wheels, cheese balls, onion rings, sherbet rolls and pale, melted fondue, bubbling in small round pots.

Rachel Laudan, a food historian and author of the 2013 book ‘‘Cuisine and Empire,’’ thinks that behind the Betty Crocker recipe box lurks the Cold War — that these glossy cards were another theater for the standoff between socialism and capitalism, a version of the message that ‘‘abundance was something to be celebrated.’’ Surely the lush profusions on each card stand in diametric opposition to the Soviet aesthetic of the day, with its homemade loaves of dark bread, its communes and caps and kvass.

Video

This proxy war probably also accounts for some of the box’s aggressive cheeriness, its implicit insistence that you should always be hosting. Of the 24 recipe-card sections, six are devoted entirely to parties, including ‘‘Entertaining on a Shoe String’’ and ‘‘Crowd-Size Entertaining.’’ The idea that, as another section suggests, you should have ‘‘Snacks Around the Clock’’ also makes particular sense when seen in the shadow of the Communist menace, under whose iron rule you most likely never had a snack ever, let alone around the clock. In the cards’ forced festivity, their embourgeoisement of celebration, freedom rang.

And yet: Maybe because I was born too late — because I am unscarred by the trauma of festive buffets abundant with canned green beans in white sauce — I see qualities in the Betty Crocker Recipe Card Library that do not seem ridiculous or deserving of pillory.

Its recipes weren’t written to appeal to the palate. Their instructions were designed to make the Teenage Fondue or Party Sandwich Loaf look a certain way: theatrical, performative, misleading. The focus on tuning precise colors and shapes — the shocking green of ‘‘Lime Ribbon Delight’’ or the perfect heart shape of ‘‘Cherry Berries on a Cloud’’ or simply the persistent symmetry of concentric circles and shingles — is here, as in all arts and crafts, a means for triggering observation.

There is something very human in the desire to turn food, which we are impelled by biology to notice, into a spectacle. That desire is ancient — in the third century, Heliogabalus served peas mixed with gold pieces, lentils scattered with onyx — and went strong through the Middle Ages. In around 1350, Taillevent recorded a peacock cooked and replumed in its plumage, and in 1390 a cookbook gave instructions for half a suckling pig sewn to a half capon, the whole lacquered silver and gold. In the 1420 ‘‘Du Fait de Cuisine,’’ we get a somewhat edible castle with a wine-filled fountain and miniature woodsmen of molded meat paste. At the 1581 wedding of the Duke of Mantua, there were cooked peacocks frilled with ribbons and marzipan statues of Hercules.

Visually arresting dishes are not simply the invention of capitalists or home economists. They are vestigial organs of our eating past. They express the eternal paradox that it is impossible to draw a clean line between the artificial and the natural — because interceding upon nature through elaborate artifice is a deep, old, natural human behavior.",REAL
Bread Is Broken,"In recent months, the lab’s newfound popularity has caused a bit of an identity crisis. Its latest collaborator is the fast-casual Mexican chain Chipotle, which wants to use one of the lab’s regional wheats in its tortillas. Chipotle serves 800,000 tortillas around the country every day. ‘‘There are definitely issues of scale,’’ Jones says. ‘‘If you have Chipotle come in, how big does it get, and how quickly? Do we end up with a commodity by any other name?’’

Jones and wheat first met when he was a child. While learning to make bagels and marbled rye from his grandmother, Jones listened to tales of the wheat farms that her family had worked on in Poland. While studying agronomy at Chico State University in the late 1970s, Jones grew a modest five acres of wheat on a campus farm. ‘‘I fell in love with it as a crop,’’ he says. He would gaze upon his wheat every day, especially before sunrise and after sunset. ‘‘I don’t know if ‘spiritual’ is the right word, but it was very moving,’’ Jones says. ‘‘I would hear voices.’’ Around that time, he saw Terrence Malick’s 1978 film ‘‘Days of Heaven,’’ which is saturated with unhurried, sunset-lit shots of oceanic wheat fields in the Texas panhandle. ‘‘That did it for me,’’ he says.

A few years after college, Jones apprenticed with an Idaho wheat breeder named D.W. Sunderman, who taught him the craft of breeding: selectively cross-pollinating plants in order to create entirely new varieties. A head of wheat contains up to a hundred hermaphroditic flowers that usually pollinate themselves. Jones would choose a head on one wheat plant and pluck out all its pollen-producing anthers with tweezers, preventing self-pollination. Then, using plastic tubing or gauze, he would bind the neutered head to an intact one on a second wheat plant. Because wheat produces so many flowers, and has a gargantuan genome many times larger than our own, a single cross can yield a carnival of wildly different offspring. ‘‘He taught me how beautiful plant breeding could be,’’ Jones says of Sunderman, ‘‘and also the notion that if I wanted his job, I would have to get a Ph.D.’’

In 1991, Jones completed his doctorate in genetics at the University of California, Davis, and the U.S.D.A. hired him to study the wheat genome at Washington State University’s main campus in Pullman. Three years later, Jones landed a job as one of W.S.U.’s chief wheat breeders. At first, he was ecstatic, but disillusionment soon followed. The essence of plant breeding is innovation — the prospect of creating something truly novel. Yet in his first official role as a wheat breeder, Jones felt stifled. He was tasked with improving the yield and disease-resistance of wheat cultivars that had been designed for industrial milling. Prioritizing qualities the food industry considered superfluous was discouraged. When he tried breeding wheat with higher levels of nourishing minerals, like iron, zinc and magnesium, he was told those characteristics were unimportant. When he proposed working with a healthier wheat that still made excellent bread flour — albeit of a somewhat yellow tint — the university expressed no interest, he says.

Commodity wheats are defined in just three ways: hard (high in protein, which is good for bread) or soft (better for pastries); red (dark color and strong flavor) or white (pale and more delicate-tasting); and winter or spring, depending on when they are planted. ‘‘Hard red spring,’’ for example, is often used for bread; ‘‘soft white winter’’ is better for pastries. A vast majority of America’s 56 million acres of wheat grow in a belt stretching more than 1,000 miles from the Canadian border to Central Texas. Around half of the crop is exported, and most of what remains is funneled to feedlots for cattle or to giant mills and bread factories, which churn out all those bags of generic white flour and limp sandwich bread sleeved twice in plastic. This industrial system forces plant breeders to prioritize wheat kernels of highly specific sizes, colors and hardness.

By 2007, Jones had spent more than a decade begrudgingly breeding wheats for the commodities market. His opinion of industrial agriculture was no secret, however. As tensions mounted between Jones and the university, he made a bold decision: In order to escape the commodities system, he would give up wheat altogether. In 2008, he moved to W.S.U.’s western campus to become director of the W.S.U.-Mount Vernon Research Center, which helps small- and mid-scale farmers in the surrounding Skagit Valley, halfway between Seattle and Vancouver, grow about 80 different kinds of fruits, vegetables and flowers.

While preparing for the move, Jones thought he would end up working on cabbage for sauerkraut or cucumbers for pickling; he didn’t have a spiritual connection with those crops, but he liked them well enough. Driving around the area, how­ever, he was startled to discover one wheat field after another. Farmers told him it was crucial for crop rotations, which disrupt disease cycles and return nutrients to the soil. They harvested and sold the grain, but only to lose less money. There was no sense in trying to compete with giant growers in the nation’s wheat belt. What would happen, Jones wondered, if he developed unique varieties of wheat adapted to the Skagit’s cool, wet climate and extremely fertile soil? What if he could interest local millers and bakers in dealing primarily with Washington wheat? What if wheat, like wine, had terroir? After all, it used to.

The giant band of wheat that stripes the center of America is a byproduct of the industrial age. From the 18th century to the early 19th century, wheat was grown mainly near the coasts. During this time, immigrants and American emissaries introduced numerous varieties — Mediterranean, Purple Straw, Java, China, Pacific Bluestem — which breeders tinkered with, adapting them to various soils. All that preindustrial wheat was a living library of flavors: vanilla, honeysuckle, black pepper. Agricultural journals of the time noted the idiosyncrasies of wheat kernels — whether they were red and bearded, velvety or ‘‘plump, round, of a coffeelike form’’ — and distinguished wheats that produced ‘‘excellent’’ and ‘‘well-flavored’’ bread from those that yielded ‘‘inferior’’ loaves. Two wheats in particular, Red Fife and Turkey Red, became immensely popular in part because of their robust nuttiness.

As wheat spread from the coasts inward, so did flour mills. By 1840, 23,000 of them were scattered throughout the country. (Today there are around 200.) People would bring wheat they farmed themselves, or bought from nearby farmers, to the closest mill. As the culinary historian Karen Hess noted: ‘‘Even if you yourself did not grow wheat, you knew that what you bought was local wheat, and you knew its baking characteristics.’’ Bakers and homemakers were used to adjusting their recipes to accommodate different varieties. And they knew how to spot high-quality flour: ‘‘Good flour adheres slightly to the hand, and if pressed in the hand retains its shape,’’ advised ‘‘The Young Housekeeper’s Friend,’’ published in 1845.

In the mid-1800s, America’s patchwork of regional grain economies began to give way to a much more integrated system. The Erie Canal and transcontinental railroads opened up the vast expanse of the Great Plains to wheat farmers, while also offering affordable ways to ship grain across the country. By the late 1800s, wheat farming had largely shifted to Midwestern states.

At the same time, the Industrial Revolution fundamentally altered the process of turning grain into flour. Jones has a pantomime he likes to perform when discussing the millenniums-long history of milling: ‘‘First, there was pounding with mortar and pestle,’’ he says, smashing a fist into an open palm. ‘‘Then, there was this’’ — he moves his hands back and forth parallel to the ground, mimicking the manual grinding of grain between two slabs of stone. ‘‘Then, it turned into this,’’ he continues, rotating his hands around an invisible vertical axis to conjure the motion of the stone mill, which could be powered by water, wind or animal. ‘‘And then this.’’ He points his index fingers toward each other and spins them in sync.

That last transition, the steel roller mill — which first appeared in Budapest in 1839 — was a radical departure from previous techniques, because it sheared the wheat kernel apart. A grain of wheat has three main components: a fibrous and nutrient-rich outer coating called the bran; the flavorful and aromatic germ, a living embryo that eventually develops into the adult plant; and a pouch of starch known as the endosperm, which makes up the bulk of the grain. Before roller mills, all three parts were mashed together when processed. As a result, flour was not the inert white powder most of us are familiar with today; it was pungent, golden and speckled, because of fragrant oils released from the living germ and bits of hardy bran. If freshly ground flour was not used within a few weeks, however, the oils turned it rancid.

Roller mills solved this problem. Their immense spinning cylinders denuded the endosperm and discarded the germ and bran, producing virtually unspoilable alabaster flour composed entirely of endosperm. It was a boon for the growing flour industry: Mills could now source wheat from all over, blend it to achieve consistency and transport it across the nation without worrying about shelf life. That newfound durability came at a huge cost, however, sacrificing much of the grain’s flavor and nutrition. In the 1940s, to compensate for these nutritional deficiencies, flour producers started fortifying white flour with iron and B vitamins, a ubiquitous practice today. The rise of roller milling and bread factories also put pressure on plant breeders to make wheat even more amenable to the new dominant technologies; whiteness, hardness and uniformity took precedence over flavor, nutrition and novelty.

Today, whole-wheat flour accounts for only 6 percent of all flour produced in the United States. And most whole-wheat products sold in supermarkets are made from roller-milled flour with the germ and bran added back in. According to the F.D.A.’s standards, flour labeled ‘‘whole wheat’’ must retain the germ, bran and endosperm in their native proportions, and ‘‘whole-wheat bread’’ must be made with whole-wheat flour, but the agency does not verify products’ composition before they hit the market.

It’s also unclear how industrial mills add back the oily germ without significantly shortening shelf life, a topic they are hesitant to discuss. David Killilea, a nutrition scientist at the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute in California, says big mills might deactivate the living germ by steaming it or exposing it to gamma rays. In Michael Pollan’s most recent book, ‘‘Cooked,’’ one former General Mills employee confesses that the germ was thrown out because it was too much trouble. Killilea and his colleagues are currently developing a test to determine the proportions of endosperm, germ and bran in an anonymous sample of flour, which could bring transparency to the murky practices of industrial mills.

When Jones arrived at Mount Vernon, he started digging through seed banks, collecting both heirloom wheats and modern varieties, crossbreeding them and adapting them to the Skagit Valley’s climate. In 2010, he had some of his favorite varieties stone-milled and then brought several five-pound bags of flour to the Seattle-based baker George De Pasquale for an expert evaluation.

De Pasquale took handfuls of flour and crushed them in his fist to assess their moisture. He quickly mixed the flours with water and yeast and scooped up a portion to taste. Finally, he baked a baguette, a batard and a miche with each flour. ‘‘A couple did not have much flavor or structure,’’ he says, ‘‘but one of them in particular, Bauermeister, knocked my socks off.’’ The bread came out of the oven dark brown. He sliced into it, squeezed the loaf near his face and breathed in: There was a noticeable aroma of chocolate, an alcoholic twang and hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. He took a bite. ‘‘The flavors were so deep, so complex,’’ De Pasquale says. ‘‘The cell structure was really beautiful too. Giant holes, chewable and soft. I’d never been whacked on the head like that before.’’

Inspired by De Pasquale’s reaction, Jones ramped up his efforts to breed for ‘‘flavor, nutrition, funkiness.’’ Each year, Jones and his senior scientific assistant, Steve Lyon, along with three graduate students — Bethany Econopouly, Brigid Meints and Colin Curwen-McAdams — grow between 5,000 and 10,000 kinds of wheat. So far the Mount Vernon breeders have produced wheat with higher than typical levels of iron and other micronutrients; grains that are strikingly blue, purple and black; and wheats that imbue bread with maltiness, spice, caramel — a whole palette of flavors most people would never expect. ‘‘Much as grapes acquire a sense of place, we are finding so does wheat,’’ Jones says. This fall, he plans to publicly release two lines: a West Coast-adapted version of a French wheat named Renan, and a hard red winter wheat called Skagit 09, each of which makes excellent, nutty, moderately dark bread. Once released, the cultivars will either be freely distributed or sold affordably to farmers.

At first, it was just Jones baking bread from his wheat. Two years ago, having reached his ‘‘limit of credibility,’’ he decided to hire a resident baker. He settled on Jonathan Bethony, a slender man who sports a thick chestnut beard and has studied with some of the best in his field. With Bethony onboard, the Bread Lab’s reputation grew even faster, drawing in an ever-widening circle of bread masters and renowned chefs. The lab also became the host of the Grain Gathering, an annual conference that attracts 250 grain obsessives from all over the country. Jones and his colleagues have now outgrown their cozy headquarters; by spring of next year, they will move to a 12,000-square-foot building that they are renting from the Port of Skagit. Their new home will feature a much larger lab and an educational center where King Arthur Flour will train 2,000 bakers each year.

Slide Show

Encouraged by the Bread Lab’s success, a group of investors is planning to build a mill nearby, which will have the capacity to produce millions of pounds of flour annually. In part, this is an attempt to solve a huge challenge for large bakeries interested in freshly milled whole-wheat flour: inconsistency. Although the new mill may produce some single-variety stone-ground flours, it will focus on roller-milling wheat and blending different types to achieve uniformity. These first signs of concession to industrial techniques have alarmed some in Jones’s circle. Perhaps, they worry, the Bread Lab and its affiliated projects are getting too big and too popular for their own good. Is it really possible to scale up without becoming the very type of system Jones and the others fled?

Such concerns have been worsened by the Bread Lab’s new high-profile partner, Chipotle. Steve Ells, the company’s founder, learned of Jones around three years ago through conversations with Glenn Roberts of Anson Mills and Dan Barber. At the time, Ells was determined to meet his promise of ‘‘food with integrity,’’ of working with sustainably grown, locally sourced whole ingredients when possible. ‘‘The tortilla was the outlier,’’ he says: Chipotle’s was made with commodity flour, dough conditioners and chemical preservatives. A single trip to the Bread Lab convinced Ells that Jones and his team could replace Chipotle’s tortillas with a more healthful and tastier whole-wheat version.

After a few false starts, Bethony devised a viable recipe using just five ingredients: water, oil, salt, whole-wheat Edison flour and a sourdough starter. The starter, a living concoction of flour, water and microbes, is not exactly standard procedure for a tortilla, but it is crucial for Bethony’s version: It magnifies flavor, makes the wheat molecules more digestible and extends the tortilla’s shelf life by adding acidity. Bethony taught his techniques to Ruben Berber and Tom Hoffert, who work in research and development at Don Pancho Authentic Mexican Foods in Salem, Ore., Chipotle’s primary tortilla supplier in the Northwest.

To accommodate Ells’s vision, Don Pancho has seriously modified its production process. The company must continually prepare and store large volumes of sourdough starter, maintaining just the right temperature and pH level. Further complicating matters, whole-wheat flour is often temperamental. It absorbs much more water than most bakers expect, and the shards of bran threaten to tangle the smooth strands of gluten, creating a sandy texture. If something goes wrong, the tortillas might turn out too bitter, or not stretch to their full size, which would be disastrous for a burrito that typically envelops more than half a day’s recommended calories. So Don Pancho has been cutting Edison with white flour. The tortillas they have produced so far are dense, golden-tinged and slightly tangy.

Ells plans to test the semi-whole-wheat tor­tillas in the Pacific Northwest. If things go well, he says, he will pair regional sources of wheat with tortilla makers around the country, which means the tortillas in, say, California might taste different from those in Florida — a discrepancy that would make many chains cringe. Although Jones and his community celebrate Chipotle’s openness to such diversity, they have also been unnerved by its interest. When Jones started working with wheat farmers in the Skagit Valley, he hoped to ‘‘keep value where it was produced,’’ not to partner with a company that has more than 1,900 venues and serves 1.4 million customers each day. What if satisfying Chipotle deprives others?

Edison wheat grows primarily in one location: 500 acres of Oregon farmland managed by Jones’s collaborators Tom and Sue Hunton and their family. A few months ago, nearly all of that wheat had been reserved for Chipotle, which irked some of the Huntons’ customers, like Mel Darbyshire of Grand Central Bakery in Seattle and Nan Kohler, who owns Grist & Toll, the only stone mill in greater Los Angeles. ‘‘Businesses like mine and local bakers need to be baking with that Edison,’’ Kohler said at the time. ‘‘If Chipotle walks away, then what? We haven’t created something sustainable.’’

Since then, thanks to a bountiful harvest and a decreased quota from Chipotle, the Huntons have been able to sell Edison to Darbyshire and Kohler. Tom Hunton is still waiting on an official contract from Chipotle. Yet he is optimistic that the partnership will work out. He also sees this as an opportunity to extend the benefits of re­gional grain economies beyond their geographic borders. ‘‘In this case, even over distance, the connection between grower, baker and miller is much more cemented and transparent than other instances in a closer radius,’’ he says. ‘‘There’s a void out there that needs to be filled with something other than the industrial-mill model. This is one way to do it.’’

Despite the Bread Lab’s growing influence, it is still quite sealed off from most of American society. For those of us who are not ardent home bakers buying fresh whole-grain flour from one of the few recently resurrected stone mills, who do not regularly queue up at Tartine or dine at the likes of Blue Hill, the kinds of wheat and bread the lab extols are still largely inaccessible. That is the power of industrial agriculture: It has so thoroughly expunged genuine whole-wheat flour from our diet that most of us do not even notice its absence. And here is where the partnership with Chipotle just might make sense: If it succeeds, it will bring real whole wheat to more American plates than any other Bread Lab collaboration so far.

Of course, that all depends on how faithful Chipotle remains to Jones’s grand vision. If the final tortillas are less than 50 percent Edison, aren’t they just the restaurant equivalent of the imitation whole wheat from the grocery store? A month or so after touring the Bread Lab, I asked Jones one last time whether he was worried about compromising, now that his dream was giving way to an ambiguous reality. After all, this was a man who practiced daily communion with his wheat plants. His swift response surprised me: ‘‘Our job at the Bread Lab is not to get all religious on 100-percent whole wheat.’’ Then he caught himself. ‘‘Although,’’ he continued in a quieter voice, ‘‘I guess we do.’’",REAL
Going Vegetarian in Israel,"My mom told my dad that I would get over it by tomorrow. The next day, she made my favorite — her famous schnitzel. But even though the schnitzel was made of chicken, not deer meat, and even though Bambi had no friends who were chickens, the die had been cast: I had become a vegetarian.

In those years, the concept ‘‘vegetarianism’’ didn’t exist in Israel, but the first natural-food store had opened a bus ride away from our house, and one day my mom came home with a large bag of dry, lumpy, yellow-brown stuff that had the texture of Styrofoam and was labeled ‘‘meat substitute.’’ My mom discovered that if she soaked it in hot water long enough, it turned into something salty and rubbery, a salty and rubbery something that her peculiar son really liked.

Soon, bags of the stuff were piled up in our house. My mom cooked it in huge pots and froze it in small portions, and I ate it every day.

Soon, a rumor spread through the neighborhood that Etgar’s mom served a special dish you couldn’t get anywhere else in the world. Some said it was camel meat, others claimed it had been created in a Weapons Development Authority lab, but all the neighborhood kids agreed that it was the food of the gods, and they lied and schemed their way to our kitchen table to partake of it.

I kept eating the stuff on a daily basis until I was 13, when the owner of the natural-food store went to study in a yeshiva in Jerusalem and closed his shop. I remember eating my last portion very, very slowly.

Quite a few meat substitutes have since appeared on the supermarket shelves in Israel, some no less salty and rubbery than the stuff that nourished me through childhood. But somehow, none of them can hold a candle to that legendary, magical dish my mother made.

No Lucky Charms in Pakistan,"Photo

These days, there is much frightened talk of migrants coming from poor countries to rich ones. I made the same journey 35 years ago, but in reverse.

At age 9, I left Palo Alto, Calif., for Lahore, Pakistan, the city where I was born, but which I could no longer remember. Many things were different in my new home. And things tasted funny. Not the Pakistani food. Milk tasted funny. Bread tasted funny. Cereal tasted funny. And not in a good way.

I found myself missing what might be called American supermarket cuisine. There was no Nestlé Quik and no Hershey’s chocolate syrup. No Heinz ketchup. No Lucky Charms. Worst of all, there was no peanut butter. Not just no Jif, but no peanut butter at all. Which was a bit of a crisis, as I ate a couple of peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches a day.

In time, I grew accustomed to the local hamburgers and fries. And I loved chapatis and matar keema and dal and shami kebabs, so I wasn’t going hungry.

I remember, though, being crushed when we heard about a new restaurant that had pizza on the menu, supposedly the first pizza in Lahore, and rushed there, only to order it and discover a round piece of bread — like a larger version of a water cracker — with a few pieces of unmelted cheese on top. My dad, perhaps the gentlest man I know, asked for the manager and said, ‘‘This isn’t a pizza.’’ I couldn’t have expressed it better myself. But I was finding it difficult to speak.

American food, and supermarket cuisine in particular, continued to exert a powerful emotional force on me through my childhood. There was a war raging in Afghanistan, and many American families in Lahore. I had American friends whose parents worked at the consulate, or for U.S.A.I.D., and they had access to a mythical place called the Commissary, where American products were sold. I never got there. But once in a while, I got to eat an American hot dog with American ketchup, mustard and relish, or chow down on a piping hot Pop-Tart, and in those moments I felt like a captive dolphin returned to the wild.

I didn’t visit California again until I moved to America for college. There was no Internet when I was a kid, and phone calls cost a fortune. I lost touch with all of my friends. I lost touch with a life of barbecues and hiking in the foothills and swimming in Lake Lagunita. I lost touch with being the child of young parents, as we all do. Somehow, American supermarket cuisine was like a way back.",REAL
An Unforgettable Tagine in Morocco,"Photo

Moha, who wanted to be our guide, said it was an easy hike to the Bridge of God. But he looked about 15 and spoke in a timid voice that made me doubt how easy it would really be. We were at the trailhead in Akchour, a small village nestled in the Rif Mountains in northern Morocco . ‘‘How long will it take?’’ my daughter asked.

I translated her question into Arabic for Moha. ‘‘It depends how fast we walk,’’ he replied. ‘‘With small children, three or four hours.’’ The adults in our party were eager to do the hike; the children, not so much. Something is always lost in translation, but as Salman Rushdie once put it, something can also be gained. ‘‘Only a couple of hours,’’ I said in English.

We followed Moha down the trail toward the river. Its banks were so narrow that we had to hold onto tree limbs and scramble over mossy rocks to make our way. In places, we waded into the water, which was chilly, even in August.

After we’d labored for several miles, after the children had asked for the 10th time whether we were there yet, we finally saw, rising 80 feet above the river, a red rock formation that resembled an arch. This was Qantarat Sidi-Rabbi, the Bridge of God. A breathtaking sight.

Then I noticed a blue sign hanging from a tree branch. ‘‘Welcome to Bridge of God,’’ it said. Behind it was a wooden shack, with an open terrace. A cafe, here! There were no tables or chairs or menus or waiters, just a cook with earthenware dishes and a barbecue pit.

A Poor Man’s Guest in Addis Ababa,"Photo

I was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Indian parents who were hired by Haile Selassie to teach in the schools he had built across the highland empire. Every middle-class home there had to have a full-time guard, or zabanya. The particular zabanya who shapes this memory had moved to the capital from the provinces. His name has vanished, but not his perpetual grin, which suggested that life in the metropolis seemed grand to him. The shack by the gate where he slept barely had room for a cot, but it was probably more comfortable than the hut a mile away where his wife and child stayed.

This man’s duty included opening the gate as the family car came and went; as night fell and the mist descended at that high elevation, we would hear him walking around the house, tapping his staff on the ground and clearing his throat to make would-be robbers (and his employers) aware of his presence.

His wife sent him his daily meal in a deep round-bottomed bowl with a tightfitting lid. This type of vessel was exceedingly popular in Ethiopia, and you saw it displayed in colorful stacks in the mercato. The cheap white enamel was baked onto the tin, and it flaked off readily in configurations more interesting than the original floral pattern. The guard’s daughter, who was 10 years old, like me, carried the bowl to him in a gauzy cloth slung over her back, as if she were carrying an infant.

On the rare occasions when I witnessed the drop-off, he insisted that I join him. We would wash at the garden tap, then sit on his cot. My mouth would water even before he pulled off the lid. His wife had lined the cavity with the bread known as injera, porous side up. Made out of a fermented grain called teff, injera batter is baked on a giant flat plate much as a crepe is. Because it isn’t flipped, the top becomes a lunar landscape, spongy and full of crevices.

On top of this lining, his wife had poured the wat, which typically was just shiro: mashed lentils cooked in butter and spices, the poor man’s staple. Sometimes she sent a fiery red version with meat or a boiled egg in it. (My mother would often send meat or eggs home with him when he went to visit his family.)

A napkin-size slab of folded injera covered the wat, and we would begin here, tearing off pieces and using them to scoop out the stew in the center. As host, he would insist — as is Ethiopian tradition — on feeding me the first morsel from his hand to my mouth.

The best part of the meal was always the last: The wat would have soaked into the injera used as the liner to the tin bowl, saturating its every crevice. Whenever I hear the expression ‘‘silver lining,’’ what comes to mind is not clouds but delectable, soggy, saturated injera peeling off chipped enamel.",REAL

You renounced your American citizenship in 2006, saying part of your frustration was with the re-election of George Bush and another part of it was having to pay American estate taxes on your London home. Correct, correct.

But doesn’t that put you on the same side of the issue as George Bush, who campaigned to eliminate the estate tax? Oh, my God! Oh. Is that true? I didn’t know that. I didn’t know he was my hero.

You and George Bush have other things in common as well. He has taken up painting in his retirement. He has been copying me ever since I made ‘‘Brazil.’’ When I went back to America some years ago, I was thinking of suing him and Dick Cheney for the illegal and unauthorized remake of the movie. And now he’s taking up cartooning, is he?

I also learned in the book that you are one of those people who trained your cat to use the toilet. That’s not quite accurate. He did it himself. He watched me. He would just climb up on the toilet bowl with four feet and straddle the thing and pee. I mean, that’s not the position I take, but I think he got the idea from me.

I was going to say: If you can teach a cat to use the toilet, you should be able to get ‘‘Don Quixote’’ made. You’ve been trying since 1999. Maybe that’s the trick. Maybe when I go to the next financier, I’ll just have to pee somewhere in the corner and inspire them. We’re supposed to be shooting next April. There we go. It’s just my Sisyphean project.

Letter of Recommendation: Vicks Nasal Spray,"Photo

Dublin, Sept. 14. At 10 o’clock in the morning, having established myself at my desk, I retrieve from a drawer my Vicks Sinex Micromist nasal-decongestant spray. This substance I self-administer as follows: Holding the small glass bottle in my right hand, I position the pad of my thumb at its base and, pincering the white plastic nasal applicator snugly between index and middle fingers, place the apparatus first in my left nostril and then in my right, discharging into each cavity in turn the maximum recommended dosage of two sprays — referred to on the street as ‘‘the double spritz’’ (at least on my street, at least by me). I inhale through the nostrils with as much force as the blocked plumbing of my sinuses will permit, allowing the vapor to penetrate deep into my respiratory workings.

The day’s inaugural spritzing now complete, I lean back in my chair and endure the familiar mild chemical sting in the sinuses as I wait for the vapor to exert its arcane magic — await, that is, the salutary sensation of the luminary conduits opening up, ensuring safe passage between the world and the in­terior of my body. By five minutes past the hour, I am imbibing with relish the very stuff of life itself.

I succumb to the common cold probably more often than I should, being a more or less healthy person, more or less in the prime of life. This may have something to do with the fact that I live on a damp and blustery outcropping of rock in the North Atlantic, or that I take public transport regularly, or that I don’t eat enough fresh fruit, or that I don’t get enough sleep. Or it might simply be that my milquetoast immune system has decided that a blocked nose isn’t worth getting itself roughed up over. For whatever reason, striving to breathe through swollen nasal passages is an activity I find myself engaged in more often than I’d like.

In my slightly hysterical imagination, this offers a foretaste of death — a form of gradual asphyxiation, like being entombed alive in the sarcophagus of my own head. To be unable to breathe through the nose is, I accept, not quite the same thing as being unable to breathe at all — which I understand is an especially grim experience — but neither is it entirely distinct. Nasal congestion is a kind of halfway house between the two: certainly preferable to death from suffocation, but not nearly as far away as you’d like it to be.

A blog post called ‘‘I Have a Nose Spray Addiction — I’m Addicted to Afrin,’’ on nosesprayaddiction.com, has more than 1,200 comments. An excerpt from one: ‘‘I have recurring nightmares that I’m kidnapped and my mouth taped shut and I suffocate. Much to my family’s dismay, this results in my terrorizing screams in the middle of the night. … I’m so glad I’ve come across this website. Knowing I’m not the only one suffering from this awful dependency is comfort in itself.’’

A blocked nose deadens the mind. I find writing difficult under even the most favorable of conditions, but when I feel as if my skull has been pumped full of high-density insulation foam, I’m as good as out of the game. In this sense, nasal congestion — with its sealing off of essential thoroughfares, its hermetic closure of the head from the outside world — feels like nothing so much as an overly literal manifestation of writer’s block.

And so there is something miraculous, and highly psychologically suggestive, about the way in which a nasal-decongestant spray goes about its work, broadening the straits of respiration. To feel that soft popping sensation in the si­nuses, that gradual but inexorable opening of the airways, is to feel the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between yourself and the world, an opening of the borders between the body and the air.",REAL
How the Motorcycle Jacket Lost Its Cool and Found It Again,"Photo

Out at dinner one recent night, I watched the couple at the next table drift into a moment of ultralight petting. She had on a black leather motorcycle jacket, and he was toying, not quite idly, with the zipper at the cuff of its tapered right sleeve. The chain of the zipper caught the candlelight, as did the supple surface of the leather, which seemed as soft as lambskin and poorly suited for riding (let alone very suddenly not riding) a bike down the blacktop. But her cuff could zip shut to seal out the wind, and he was playing with its pull. Zip, and then unzip; he was enchanted. I had seen motorcycle jackets look sharp, hard, camp, goonish and corny, but this cuteness was new to me, and perhaps to the jacket, a garment that keeps compounding its power to activate imaginations.

The classic motorcycle jacket — double-­breasted, distinguished by an asymmetric front zipper and ample lapels — was pioneered by Irving Schott in 1928. (People tend to abuse Schott’s trademark, Perfecto, as a generic reference to any of the countless models inspired by its cut.) With its aerodynamic geometry and lavish romance of machines, the design exemplifies Art Deco values, a polished modernism no more likely to grow tiresome than the Chrysler Building. Leather seems to animate this industrial form with a primal spirit, as if we had updated ancient beliefs associating animal hides and magical powers to suit our secular rituals.

On an autumn afternoon of what fashion blogs call ‘‘leather weather,’’ I drifted south down Madison Avenue past boutiques where shopgirls who abbreviate motorcycle jacket to ‘‘moto’’ wore cropped motos on the job. At 68th Street, on a screen in the window at the luxury-­sportswear store Belstaff, David Beckham wore a mandarin-­collared racing jacket to preen through the night­scape of a promotional film. At a sidewalk cafe near 62nd, two women lunched performatively, each reflecting the other’s moto in her shades. At 61st Street, I stepped into Barneys, where motorcycle jackets priced up to $5,000 waited to seduce shoppers who were already wearing motorcycle jackets, the hardware of which coordinated with the buckles on their bootees, the chains on their purses, the gleams in their eyes.

I felt a need to put one on. What’s that jacket? Margiela, a fashion house based in Paris, intended it as a replica of a 1950s Perfecto, according to a label sewn into a quilted red lining as rich as a juicy secret. Was I trying this on or was I auditioning for it? Zipped up and belted in, cased in black calfskin, studded with silvertone snap heads, I felt armored, cosseted, insulated against the world and its mundanity. In the mirror, Narcissus was tingling. The thrust of the epaulets alone was good for a jolt of euphoria. The motorcycle jacket encour­ages a sense of confidence in its inhabitant. Foremost, it confirms the least suspicion that he has the brass to this pull off.

The motorcyclist of the popular imagination mutated from a genial daredevil into a diabolical marauder over the course of Independence Day weekend in 1947. Reviving a tradition of the 1930s, the town of Hollister, Calif., hosted a bike rally that got out of hand, swollen with men returned from the war and disturbing the peace. That the motorcycle club at the center of the action was called the Boozefighters indicates the flavor of the mayhem. Reporters covered the disorder as an epic of looting and pillage; a writer named Frank Rooney converted it into ‘‘Cyclists’ Raid,’’ a short story published in Harper’s Magazine. Rooney’s protagonist wore a brown windbreaker, but the film producer Stanley Kramer, adapting the story into ‘‘The Wild One,’’ had a rather more vivid idea of how to outfit an antihero. Here was Marlon Brando, in a Schott Perfecto, prowling the frame, exaggerating an old standard of male beauty to arrive at a new ideal of neoclassical beefcake. The film debuted in 1953 — the year Elvis Presley made his earliest recordings and the first color TVs went on sale — and likewise announced the opening of a new era in imagery.

Slide Show

‘‘The Wild One’’ has not aged well, but that scarcely matters. Brando’s mumbles articulated a style of spite, and his poses in publicity stills shaped a creed of cool that does not age at all. Having hurtled into a Nowheresville of an Anytown, he is hypermasculine and stereotypically feminine at once as he leans on the bike, a brute with the grace of an odalisque on a divan, commanding adoration. Brando’s jacket — until then most notable as the protective gear of aviators and highway patrolmen — became an institution on the strength of the way he wore it. Together they made a meme — a look swiftly mimicked, cloned, valorized, spoofed, appropriated by couturiers and silk-­screened by Andy Warhol in a series of works that must constitute its sanctification. In ‘‘Four Marlons,’’ Warhol printed one still in quadruplicate on a raw linen canvas evocative of gold. Here was a personality to build a cult around.",REAL
Has ‘Diversity’ Lost Its Meaning?,"This disconnect is not, of course, limited to tech. In this year's annual Pub­lishers Weekly survey of book-publishing employees, respondents — 89 percent of whom were white — found ‘‘no real change’’ in the racial composition of the work force since last year, despite ‘‘increased attention given to diversity.’’ The television and film industries are being investigated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over complaints of sex discrimination. And yet, as is the case in Silicon Valley, small victories are often overenthusiastically celebrated as evidence of larger change. In September, for example, when Viola Davis became the first African-American woman to win the Best Actress in a Drama Series Emmy, the moment was cheered in the press as a triumph of racial equity in Hollywood. But just a month before, Stacy L. Smith, a professor of communication at U.S.C. who, with other researchers, had just released a damning report that studied gender bias in 700 films made between 2007 and 2014, lamented ‘‘the dismal record of diversity, not just for one group, but for females, people of color and the L.G.B.T. community.’’

Why is there such a disparity between the progress that people in power claim they want to enact and what they actually end up doing about it? Part of the problem is that it doesn’t seem that anyone has settled on what diversity actually means. Is it a variety of types of people on the stages of awards shows and in the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies? Is it raw numbers? Is it who is in a position of power to hire and fire and shape external and internal cultures? Is it who isn’t in power, but might be someday?

Adding to the ambiguity is the fact that the definition of ‘‘diversity’’ changes depending on who is doing the talking. The dictionary will tell you that it is ‘‘the quality or state of having many different forms, types, ideas,’’ and the word is often used, without controversy, to describe things like the environment and stock-market holdings. But in reality — which is to say, when applied to actual people, not flora, fauna or financial securities — the notion of diversity feels more fraught, positioning one group (white, male Americans) as the default, and everyone else as the Other. Multiple studies suggest that white Americans understand “diversity” much differently than black Americans. When Reynolds Farley, a demographer at the University of Michigan, researched the attitudes of people in Detroit about the racial composition of residential neighborhoods in 1976, 1992 and 2004, most African-Americans considered ‘‘integrated’’ to be a 50/50 mix of white and black, while a majority of whites considered such a ratio much too high for their comfort each time the study was conducted.

Bragging about hiring a few people of color, or women, seems to come from the same interpretive bias, where a small amount is enough. It also puts significant pressure on the few ‘‘diverse’’ folks who are allowed into any given club, where they are expected to be ambassadors of sorts, representing the minority identity while conforming to the majority one. All this can make a person doubt the sincerity of an institution or organization — and question their place within it. When I was starting out in magazines, I was told by a colleague that my hiring was part of the company’s diversity push, and that my boss had received a significant bonus as a result of recruiting me. Whether or not it was true, it colored the next few years I spent there, making me wonder whether I was simply some sort of symbol to make the higher-ups feel better about themselves.

Diversity ‘‘is an empty signifier for me now,’’ says Jeff Chang, the author of 2014’s ‘‘Who We Be: The Colorization of America,’’ though ‘‘I still strongly believe in the possibility.’’ Chang prefers ‘‘equity’’ to ‘‘diversity,’’ saying that the latter has been ‘‘deradicalized’’ from its roots in the multicultural movements of decades past. He recalls an anecdote about a diversity week at a Texas university where few white students bothered to show up. ‘‘Diversity,’’ Chang says, ‘‘has become a code word for ‘all those other folks.’ ’’ The problem with code words is that they’re lazy: They’re broad rather than specific, and can provide cover for inaction — the ‘‘I don’t know how to do this or what it means, so can someone else please do the work for me?’’ maneuver.

Talk is cheap, of course, and sometimes you get the sense that the people talking the most about diversity are the people doing the least effective work on it. In the season premiere of his HBO reality series ‘‘Project Greenlight,’’ Matt Damon explained — to a veteran African-American producer, Effie Brown — that focusing on diversity in the casting of a film was more important than promoting diversity among those working behind the camera. It was a striking example not just of mansplaining but also of whitesplaining. His implication — roundly criticized on social media and in industry publications — is that on-screen visibility is everything, when what Hollywood needs just as much, if not more, are black studio executives, writers, directors and producers: the people who decide what stories are told in the first place.

Maybe it’s not surprising that just a month later, the African-American director Ava DuVernay made the opposite argument of Damon’s at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards. DuVernay, who made ‘‘Selma,’’ pointed out that of the 100 top-grossing films last year, only two were directed by women. She urged constant vigilance and proactive searching within the industry: ‘‘We have to ask our agents about that script by the woman screenwriter. We have to ask, ‘Hey, are there any women agents here that I could talk to?’ We have to ask our lawyers about women in the office. We have to ask, when we’re thinking about directors or D.P.s, ‘Will women interview?’ ’’ Her words were powerful and refreshingly specific; they were also further evidence that the work of articulating and creating diversity often — usually! — falls to those who are themselves considered ‘‘diverse.’’

It’s something I have experienced myself. Over the past few years, numerous editors have reached out to me asking for help in finding writers and editors of color, as if I had special access to the hundreds of talented people writing and thinking on- and offline. I know they mean well, but I am often appalled by the ease with which they shunt the work of cultivating a bigger variety of voices onto others, and I get the sense that for them, diversity is an end — a box to check off — rather than a starting point from which a more inte­grated, textured world is brought into being. I’m not the only one to sense that there’s a feeling of obligation, rather than excitement, behind the idea. DuVernay herself hinted at this when she, too, admitted that she hates the word. ‘‘It feels like medicine,’’ she said in her speech. ‘‘ ‘Diversity’ is like, ‘Ugh, I have to do diversity.’ I recognize and celebrate what it is, but that word, to me, is a disconnect. There’s an emotional disconnect. ‘Inclusion’ feels closer; ‘belonging’ is even closer.’’",REAL

First of all, I am surprised that you do not know that Toby is actually a very common nickname for Aquila-­Phillipe. (But please don’t tell the fans of the country singer Aquila-­Phillipe Keith.)

Must a Quaker School Care for Its Neighbors?,"Who knows? Maybe it is already planning to do all these things.

An elderly neighbor ran a stop sign in our village as I was driving through the intersection. Fortunately, she was going only 5 miles per hour, otherwise she could have inflicted grievous bodily harm, because she plowed right into the driver’s door. Of course, she accepted blame for the accident. (‘‘My foot was stuck on the gas pedal’’ was her explanation.) And naturally, her insurance company paid for the damage. Given the number of dents in her car, I assumed the company would probably refuse to insure her after that. I hoped she would give up driving.

Whether or not the company took away her insurance, my neighbor neither sold nor retired her vehicle. A few months after the accident, I saw her car in our village and later that same day saw it parked in her driveway. Do I have an obligation to call the Department of Motor Vehicles, tell it about the accident and ask that my neighbor be submitted to a driving test? What if a child happens to walk across a street and that same neighbor runs a stop sign? If I don’t report her, won’t I be in some way complicit in that child’s injury, or worse?

I was on the verge of calling the D.M.V., but then I asked myself: How would I feel about taking away my neighbor’s mobility in a rural area with no real public transportation? Shouldn’t that be the responsibility of a relative, friend or physician? Do I really want to act as our village policeman? Paul M. Coopersmith, Marin County, Calif.

Some states — yours is one of them — allow residents to fill out a form, asking, confidentially, that a re-­evaluation be given to someone who they believe may not be a safe driver. Assuming that your neighbor is still driving, your D.M.V. may have a competent expert assess her driving ability. If she is deemed unqualified to drive, you will have saved both her and others from the risk of serious harm.

She won’t be grateful, of course, and you’re right that it would be better if someone closer to her intervened. Still, if she does have friends or relatives in the area and she loses her license, they’ll be able to step in to help. If she’s alone, you can hope, not unreasonably, that someone who can afford to keep and insure a car can afford the occasional taxi. And there may be organizations that help people in her situation with travel. You could look into this and mail her some information about the options. That would be a generous act of supererogation.

We have friends who are fairly well off. The husband is an entrepreneur and likes to talk about how much money he makes. Sadly, their son was just found to have a treatable cancer. Despite having insurance and an annual out-­of-­pocket cap that can’t be more than $13,000, they have started an online fund-­raising page and are having multiple fund-­raising events to pay their son’s medical expenses. Within a few short weeks, they have raised nearly $30,000.

In the United States, almost no one thinks he’s rich enough. Some fantastically wealthy folks may believe they have sufficient resources, but they usually don’t draw their good fortune to other people’s attention. (O.K., there’s Donald Trump and the Kardashians.) People who make much of the fact that they’re well off are sometimes fronting: They’re not doing as well as they want you to think.

If that’s what’s going on here, what your friend is doing isn’t so awful. What’s awful is that we live in a country where many people, even those with health insurance, are thrown into financial crisis by a medical emergency. There are plenty of countries where this situation couldn’t arise.

Let’s suppose, though, that you’re right, and your friend is not facing a financial emergency. When I see people raising money for medical expenses online, I assume they can pay their bills only with great sacrifice or can’t afford treatment at all. I certainly don’t suppose the money they raise is going to leave them better off than they were before! So, if the situation is as you think, I’ll confirm your suspicion: Your friend is receiving charity under false pretenses. That’s especially shameful because he’s taking advantage of people who are inclined toward ... yes, supererogation.",REAL
A Dash of Cocktails Past,"Photo

Thanks to the efforts of deeply committed cocktail revivalists, many ingredients called for in vintage recipes have been brought back from the brink. Few have labored as mightily on behalf of antique cocktails and their all-but-obsolete ingredients as Erik Ellestad, a San Francisco-based cocktail expert and former bartender who spent years working through every recipe in the classic ‘‘Savoy Cocktail Book’’ for his recently retired blog, Savoy Stomp, and Ted Haigh, the author of the delightful book ‘‘Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails.’’ The first edition of Haigh’s book, published in 2004, included an appendix with an R.I.P. list of impossible-to-get ingredients. By the time a revised version of the book came out in 2009, hardly anything remained on the list: Such 19th- and early-​20th-century stalwarts as Boker’s Bitters, Swedish punsch and pimento dram had all found new life.

I share with Ellestad and Haigh an unabashed enthusiasm for that last curious substance: pimento dram, a West Indian liqueur that has since also become known as allspice dram, to make it clear that the pimento in question is not to be confused with the stuff one might find in the middle of a canned olive. This pimento is allspice, which comes from the dried berry of the Pimenta dioica tree. It is suggestive of nutmeg and cinnamon and cloves all at once, hence its name. You know how the softest dusting of freshly grated nutmeg over all kinds of foods — say, roasted root vegetables or a potato gratin — seems to wake up an entire dish and make its other ingredients taste most fully like themselves? A little allspice dram does much the same to a cocktail. ‘‘I’ve yet to find any recipe it isn’t good in,’’ Haigh says. ‘‘Put it in a bloody mary, a navy grog, a martini, a Ramos fizz, a screwdriver, an old-fashioned or a white Russian, and the result always tastes good.’’ I sometimes use it to perk up a brandy Alexander, and Ellestad extols its versatility, too: ‘‘Around the holidays, it’s great in punch and toddies,’’ he says. ‘‘In the summer, it lends an island note to exotic rum drinks.’’

The Lion’s Tail is a classic cocktail that shows off allspice dram and frequently deploys another ingredient once relegated to the dustbin of drink history: gomme syrup. A simple syrup to which a small amount of gum arabic — dried sap from the acacia tree — has been added, gomme syrup once featured regularly in cocktails before virtually disappearing. Ellestad’s hunch is that the stuff became popular when sugar cost more than gum arabic — but now it costs much less. ‘‘I wouldn’t go out of my way to keep it on hand,’’ Ellestad says, conceding that it can make a difference in liquor-heavy cocktails, like old-fashioneds and Sazeracs. Unlike allspice, gomme syrup affects texture more than flavor. A drink made with gomme syrup will be, in Haigh’s words, ‘‘more velvety, rounder, more luscious, richer.’’ Even more reasons to revisit the past.

How to Translate Spoken Language,"Photo

‘‘Be invisible,’’ says Rasha Ajalyaqeen, a retired interpreter for the United Nations. Leave your opinions behind; your voice should reflect the speaker’s feelings. When Libya’s dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, ranted in Arabic about Jews and Palestinians during his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly in 2009, Ajalyaqeen’s English translation sounded equally agitated. ‘‘If he is angry,’’ she says, ‘‘you’re angry.’’

Beginners should strengthen their concentration and short-term memory by trying to repeat voices on the radio. ‘‘Learn to actively listen like it’s your profession,’’ Ajalyaqeen says. Forget pausing to find the right word: Fall more than 10 seconds behind, and you’ll start forgetting chunks of what was said. Aim for a lag time of between three and four seconds.

Master a subject ahead of time. In the days before Secretary of State Colin Powell’s speech to the United Nations Security Council in 2003, when he argued in favor of military action in Iraq, Ajalyaqeen studied weapons terminology and figured out how to translate less intuitive particulars like ‘‘yellowcake’’ uranium into Arabic. Because people communicate in culturally specific clichés, your repertoire of proverbs should be extensive. If an Arabic speaker says something about adding more water to mud, you’ll need to know that the English equivalent is adding insult to injury. When Ajalyaqeen interprets from Arabic at the United Nations — where she still freelances — her English is rapidly translated into French, Spanish, Russian and Chinese. Any mistake can ricochet into a high-stakes, international game of telephone.

Word-for-word translation can result in a nonsensical mess. Instead, break longer, complicated phrases into shorter units of single concepts. ‘‘A good translator does not interpret words; he interprets meaning,’’ says Ajalyaqeen, who grew up in Syria. Be prepared to dive into sen­tences without knowing where they are going grammatically. The structure of a Semitic language like Arabic differs from that of English. ‘‘Sometimes you start and you don’t know what your subject is — you’re waiting for the verb,’’ Ajalyaqeen says.

Hearing one language while simultaneously rendering a message aloud in an­other will make your brain ache. Acknowledge your limits. At the United Nations, interpreters work in 30-minute shifts, but that seemingly short span will leave you so profoundly exhausted, Ajalyaqeen says, that ‘‘by the end, you’ll be shivering.’’",REAL
Apartment House of Horrors,"Photo

Buying a place of your own is a lot of responsibility, and I wanted to put it off for a while. But then a new tenant moved in next door in the building where I lived in Mokpo, South Korea. My old neighbors had been the quietest people ever. One day after he moved in, around 3 in the afternoon, I heard something, like a woman screaming and dying. I wasn’t sure what it was, but then I realized that it was a pornographic film — the lady was having the time of her life. It turned out that this guy watched porn day and night. I was doing private tutoring in my place, and I was always afraid of what my students would hear. I thought about leaving a note, but it was just too awkward. So, I started to feel like, O.K., I need to buy a proper place.

I started house-hunting, and I saw this apartment that was really big, quiet and clean, with lots of sun. I didn’t ask for any details. I just walked in and decided I wanted it. So I bought it (for about 140,000 U.S. dollars). I didn’t know what a parade of horrors I was signing up for.

The day after I moved in, I was relaxing on the couch when I spotted some dots on the ceiling. I sprayed some insect stuff from a can at them. The next day, there were more. They doubled and then tripled. The place was full of bugs. I used 10 or 20 cans of bug spray, and I was kind of suffocating myself. So I hired an exterminator, and I had to stay out of the apartment for two days. It was the most disgusting thing you will ever experience in your life.

I thought it was all over, but I suppose I had been so occupied with the insects that I didn’t notice the noise from upstairs. There were kids always running around, and you could hear everything. I sent a text to the mother saying, ‘‘Could you please wear some slippers?’’ but she got really angry, and there was no break in the noise. I decided to call the superintendent. He was very nice, but nothing happened. So I called him again, and he was very upset. Apparently when he called the woman upstairs, she got mad and told all the other mothers in the building, and they were in some kind of boycott against him. They started avoiding his phone calls. (His phone company told him that the mothers had blocked his number.)

I endured two more weeks before I sent another text message: ‘‘Please wear some slippers, I am going crazy.’’ She sent back the most illogical text I’ve ever read. It said: ‘‘I’m on my period. The day is so bright, so I put the blankets outside. Your text message is very unpleasant.’’ And that’s when I realized that I would never be able to have a proper conversation with this woman. The problem was I still couldn’t deal with the noise itself. You buy a place, you want life to be a certain way and I knew it would never happen unless they moved out, which they wouldn’t. And so I put my place on the market. I hadn’t even lived there a month.

In the meantime, I noticed a lot of pigeons around the air compressors right outside the apartment. At first I tried to keep them away, but they were like my upstairs neighbors: They did whatever they wanted. There was a huge amount of pigeon excrement. If I left the windows open, the wind would bring the droppings inside the house. (Do you know the definition of biohazard? That’s what it was, I think.) I cleaned it with water and detergent, but the next day they made a huge mess all over again. I tried putting out a big sheet of foam with toothpicks all over it, but pigeons’ legs are longer than I thought. I also made a spiky thing using thumbtacks — I almost destroyed my fingerprints with glues and adhesives — but it didn’t work, either. I spent $200 on bird repellent, but it didn’t do anything. One day I poured boiling hot water on the thing that holds the air conditioner, so all the excrement would run off. I was using a broomstick to clean and poked something, and it turned out to be a nest! I could see tails moving. I didn’t mean to hurt anything! I got really freaked out and called 911. The birds weren’t injured, and they just threw the nest away.

About that time, I got in a car accident and I was hospitalized for 10 days. But 10 days in the hospital was heaven. It was super quiet, and my meals were served to me. It was hard to go back to my hell again. Luckily, a week after I got home, this couple called to see the place. They were there maybe 10 minutes before they decided they wanted it, so we made a contract, and they moved in.

I felt really sorry that I didn’t tell them about the noise, or the pigeons, or the insects. But nobody had told me! Anyway, now I feel like an adult. I bought a house. I sold a house. I didn’t tell the truth, but people often don’t. I went through all these things by myself, with no husband’s help, no family help. And now I know what to do.",REAL

Mahler also asserted that it was ‘‘impossible to know what was true and what wasn’t’’ about the story of bin Laden’s death, which is now ‘‘floating somewhere between fact and mythology.’’

To acknowledge that the first accounts of a major historical event — particularly when the event in question happens to be the covert operation to find and kill the most-wanted terrorist in the world — are almost always subject to revision should hardly be controversial. Stories evolve as fresh details emerge. ...

This is how history is gathered and refined. And it explains why authors continue to write new books on subjects that have been exhaustively covered before, whether it’s the McCarthy era, the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War.

At the request of D.J.’s family, Anna began to work with him, using a controversial method known as ‘‘facilitated communication.’’ Starting with her hand beneath his elbow, she helped him point at pictures, and then at letters, and eventually at the buttons of a Neo, a hand-held keyboard with a built-in screen. With his hand in hers, she helped him type out words after 30 years of silence.

Wesley and his mother had been thrilled with D.J.’s progress, but now, suddenly, they recoiled. (Neither D.J.’s family nor Anna agreed to be interviewed for this article; all their quotes and recollections are drawn from court records and testimony. P. and Wesley are referred to by a middle initial and a middle name to shield D.J.’s identity, which has not been publicly revealed.) When Wesley told Anna he thought she had taken advantage of his brother, she could not muster a response. At last, with her help, D.J. began typing: ‘‘No one’s been taken advantage of. I’ve been trying to seduce Anna for years, and she resisted valiantly.’’ Then he typed another message, meant for Anna: ‘‘Kiss me.’’ Wesley walked out.

Later, after he told Anna that she wasn’t to see his brother anymore, she tried to plead her case by phone: ‘‘I will put in writing, prick my finger and sign with blood — whatever makes you reassured that this is for real,’’ she promised in a voice mail message. ‘‘I will leave my husband, and I will make a permanent life and home with [D.J.].’’

But the family had had enough. What at first struck them as a miracle — a voice for D.J., his inner self revealed — now seemed a fraud. D.J. could not have given his consent to any love affair, they later told the authorities, because he suffers from profound mental disabilities, just as the psychologists had always told them. His ‘‘messages’’ must have been a sham. If Anna pretended otherwise, it was only so she could use D.J. as a guinea pig for research, or to further her career, or because, as Wesley would later say during the three-week trial for sexual assault that concluded this month in Newark, ‘‘she was having some sick, twisted fantasy.’’

Anna has never wavered in her claim that she and D.J. fell in love and that his messages were his. Even after she was indicted, she seemed more concerned about his fate than her own. ‘‘In the spring of 2011, [D.J.’s] access to his means of communication was taken from him,’’ she wrote in a chapter for a recent academic book, which was published while the justice system creaked its way toward trial, ‘‘and he is once again treated as severely intellectually impaired by those who have control over his life. This chapter is dedicated to him, in hope that he will one day regain his voice and his freedom.’’

Marjorie Anna Stubblefield goes by her middle name, pronounced with an aristocratic a, as in the word ‘‘nirvana.’’ Her last name is her former husband’s. Years ago, she was Margie McClennen, an honors student who grew up Jewish in the nearly all-white town of Plymouth, Mich. ‘‘I was raised to believe that I have the responsibility of tikkun olam, repairing the world,’’ Anna wrote in her 2005 book ‘‘Ethics Along the Color Line.’’ As a high-school student, she put that lesson into practice, writing articles for the school newspaper — one about a classmate who became pregnant, and another about a press-­freedom case involving Plymouth students. Each won a national award. While a sophomore, Anna played the title role in a town production of ‘‘The Diary of Anne Frank.’’ ‘‘Marjorie just was Anne Frank,’’ says Elyse Mirto, a fellow cast member who is now an actor. ‘‘You know that famous quote — ‘I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart’? That was Marjorie.’’

Her parents were involved in local politics, environmentalism and women’s rights, but their most enduring cause was that of people with disabilities. Each trained in special education for their Ph.D.s. Her mother, Sandra McClennen, started working with blind, cognitively impaired children in 1963. For decades, she taught disabled people social skills, like shaking hands and talking appropriately with strangers, in the hope of helping them move out of state-run hospitals and into community housing.

Anna shared this interest in disabilities: As a high-school student, she studied Braille and learned the alphabet in sign language. But as a junior academic, she would apply the mandate of tikkun olam to a different focus — the fight for racial justice. Since getting her Ph.D. in 2000, she has become a prominent scholar in the field of Africana philosophy, has published widely on race and ethics and has served as the chairwoman of the American Philosophical Association’s Committee on the Status of Black Philosophers — the first and only white scholar ever to have done so. ‘‘Our world is in shambles,’’ she wrote in ‘‘Ethics Along the Color Line.’’ ‘‘White supremacy is central to this state of affairs, and we cannot repair the world without ending it.’’

Her own family is mixed-­race — she has two children with her ex-­husband, Roger Stubblefield, a black tuba player and classical composer. For 11 years, she served on the faculty at the Newark campus of Rutgers University, whose student body is among the nation’s most diverse. Yet for all her work on behalf of African-­Americans, she worried that she might be ambushed by the ‘‘habits of racism.’’ ‘‘Even in well-­intentioned quests to be antiracist,’’ she wrote, ‘‘white people all too often invade or destroy the space of nonwhite people.’’ The same essay lays out what could be a thesis statement for her whole career: It is crucial, she wrote, for white philosophers ‘‘to wrestle with the horrors and conundrums of whiteness.’’

Those ‘‘horrors and conundrums,’’ as Anna saw them, formed the nexus of oppression she had sworn to fight in all its forms. As the years went by, her mission seemed to broaden and merge into her mother’s. By 2007, Anna had begun to argue that a person’s intellect — and the degree to which he or she is ‘‘disabled’’ — could be as much a social construct, as much a venue for tyranny, as race, gender or sexuality. It was, after all, white elites, she wrote, who first devised measures of I.Q. ‘‘as both a rationalization and a tool of anti-black oppression.’’

With this shift in her scholarship, Anna began to wrestle not just with race but with disability; not just with racism but with ableism. If poor, black Americans were the most vulnerable members of society, she wrote in 2009, then poor, black, disabled Americans — men like D.J., born with cerebral palsy, raised by a single mother, seemingly unable to communicate — were the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. Voiceless in both fact and metaphor, she said, they were the ones ‘‘whom we push so far to the margins of our society that most of us, regardless of race, do not even notice when they fall off the edge.’’

By the time that warning made it into print, Anna had been working with D.J. for about a year. This was her mitzvah and her tikkun olam. She was helping to repair the world.

When D.J.’s brother finished his dissertation, he included a dedication to his family: ‘‘Mom, I stand in awe of your strength and grace,’’ he wrote. Wesley also put in a message to his little brother: ‘‘[D.J.], you never cease to amaze me.’’

Wesley graduated from high school in 1993, then enrolled at Rutgers. He was always very close to his brother, whom he sometimes calls ‘‘Baby Bubba.’’ By the time Wesley was named one of D.J.’s legal guardians, he had earned a master’s degree in history; in 2009, he was on track to get his Ph.D. and in one of Anna’s courses. During class, Anna showed part of a 2004 Oscar-­nominated documentary called ‘‘Autism Is a World,’’ narrated by Julianna Margulies and co-­produced by CNN. The film described a nonverbal girl with disabilities and an I.Q. of just 29 who went to college after learning to type using facilitated communication, or F.C. The girl reminded Wesley of D.J., and after class he went to Anna for advice: Could his brother also learn to use a keyboard? Anna said she had attended a three-day workshop on the technique the year before and maybe she could help.

One Saturday not long after, Wesley and P. took D.J. up to Anna’s office in Conklin Hall. In preparation for their visit, Anna had cut out pictures from magazines and drawn on index cards. ‘‘In which room would you find a stove?’’ she asked, laying out four cards showing a kitchen, a bedroom, a bathroom and a laundry room. ‘‘Please don’t be insulted,’’ she added quickly. ‘‘I assume you know the answers to these questions.’’

D.J. couldn’t name the pictures or gesture at them on his own. It seemed to Anna that he would try to point and then freeze up and lock his hands together. So she used the method that she learned during the workshop. First, she placed her hand beneath his elbow to stabilize his arm and found that, with this help, he could pick out the picture of the kitchen. Then she asked him to show her the president of the United States, and D.J. pointed — still with her support — to a photo of Barack Obama. Now she used her other hand to tuck his pinkie, ring and middle fingers lightly under hers, as if their hands were spooning, with just his index finger sticking out. From this position, she introduced a set of letter cards and finally a keyboard. ‘‘It was clear he knew the alphabet and could spell simple words,’’ she said later. ‘‘He was a fast learner.’’

P. took D.J. to Rutgers every other Saturday and then asked Anna over to her house for more facilitation. ‘‘I would get excited: ‘Did he do something?’ ’’ P. said. ‘‘I tried to contain myself, but [Anna] said I was distracting him.’’ At one point, Anna had to make P. leave the room.

That fall, P. took more than half a dozen mothers of children with disabilities — friends from her support group — to meet with Anna and learn about facilitated communication. (One soon began working with Anna.) ‘‘I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread,’’ P. said.

Wesley was enthusiastic, too. When he met other users of facilitated communication, he noticed that D.J. was among the very few who weren’t white and didn’t come from some degree of privilege. ‘‘I was proud,’’ he said in court. ‘‘Who wouldn’t be?’’ His brother ‘‘was the Jackie Robinson of F.C.’’

The method that Anna used with D.J., and with several other clients at the time, was devised some 40 years ago to help a girl with cerebral palsy named Anne McDonald. Born in 1961 to a family that ran a dry-­cleaning business in a railway town 60 miles north of Melbourne, Australia, she came out feet first, with signs of fetal distress. For the first hour of her life, she could not breathe on her own. At 3, she was given a diagnosis of spastic quadriplegia with severe mental retardation and sent to the St. Nicholas Hospital for children with profound disabilities.

Even as a teenager, McDonald was small enough to fit into a baby stroller and weighed less than 30 pounds. Her eyes were often crossed, and her arms, neck and tongue remained in constant motion. When Rosemary Crossley, then an assistant at the Mental Health Authority, first saw McDonald, she was bone thin and writhing on the floor. Neither McDonald nor any other child had toys or wheelchairs, Crossley has said, and they weren’t getting an education, either. ‘‘Just the floor and a cot,’’ is how she remembered it.

In 1974, Crossley selected McDonald and seven other children for a special play group. She called them ‘‘beanbaggers’’ — most were so physically disabled that they could sit only in beanbag chairs. Three years later, she turned the play group into a communication study. Her plan was to ask the kids to point at objects, photographs and words, and thus find a way for them to voice their basic needs. She started with McDonald: ‘‘ ‘Annie, I think I can teach you to talk,’ ’’ she recalls in ‘‘Annie’s Coming Out,’’ the memoir she wrote with McDonald. ‘‘ ‘Not with your mouth ... but with your hands, by pointing to pictures of things.’ ’’

The problem was that McDonald had a lot of trouble pointing. When she tried to move her arm, Crossley wrote, it would ‘‘shut up like a rabbit trap,’’ sometimes snapping back against her face. Crossley realized that she would have to keep it balanced. ‘‘I was acting as a responsive item of furniture, not moving her arm but simply facilitating her own movement.’’

The supported pointing worked brilliantly. Now, McDonald could pick out word-blocks and form sentences like ‘‘I want a book, please.’’ Just two weeks into this training, Crossley took out a magnetic board with letters on it to see if McDonald could spell things on her own. Less than a week later, McDonald pointed to the letters ‘I’ and ‘H’ and then to 11 more, producing ­‘‘IHATEFATROSIE.’’ ‘‘This is the first sentence Annie ever spelled,’’ Crossley wrote. ‘‘Annie had freed herself.’’

After a month, McDonald demonstrated a familiarity with local politics. In two months, she was doing fractions. It all happened so quickly that some of Crossley’s colleagues wondered if her assisted pointing might be a fraud. Perhaps Crossley had controlled the children’s hands herself, guiding them to shapes and letters in the way that people move the pointer on a Ouija board.

Crossley had the same concern. ‘‘What I did not know was whether I was subconsciously manipulating her,’’ she wrote, ‘‘or imagining her hand movements over the letters and making up sentences to fit what were really random twitchings.’’ But she became convinced that the method worked after McDonald started spelling things with other people — including references to private jokes that no one else could have known. How had she learned so much so fast? She had worked out the rudiments of language by watching television and overhearing nurses’ conversations. She had learned arithmetic by counting slats on the barriers that enclosed her cot.

Soon after McDonald turned 18, she went to court for the right to leave St. Nicholas. In a proceeding, she was shown an arbitrary pair of words — ‘‘string’’ and ‘‘quince’’ — while Crossley was not in the room. Then she had to spell them out with Crossley’s help. ‘‘String’’ and ‘‘quit,’’ she wrote. Not exactly right, but close enough. The judge accepted the method and ruled that McDonald was competent to make her own decisions. Addressing the press right after, she spelled: ‘‘Thank you. Free the still imprisoned!’’ McDonald went on to graduate from college and died at 49.

The philosophy that drove Crossley’s work, one of radical inclusion, was gaining traction in the world of special education. In 1984, the same year that ‘‘Annie’s Coming Out’’ was made into a movie, Anne Donnellan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, published a sort of manifesto for disability rights. An academic paper called ‘‘The Criterion of the Least Dangerous Assumption,’’ it advised teachers on how to treat disabled children: When you assume they will never function as adults, when you shunt them into special classes and give them toys meant for younger children, you make them victims of your meager expectations. It’s better to treat every child as if he or she has hidden talents, Donnellan warned, because if you do the opposite, what happens if you’re wrong?

Assuming competence was the founding principle of Crossley’s method. But her work would not become widely known until a Syracuse professor of education named Douglas Biklen visited Crossley’s Melbourne clinic in 1988. He described that trip — along with a second one a few months later — in a bombshell paper for The Harvard Educational Review in August 1990. The implications were enormous, Biklen wrote. Those who had been categorized as having among the ‘‘lowest’’ intellectual capacities could now tell the world they existed; they could say, as he put it, ‘‘We will reveal ourselves, we will show our creativity, when we feel appreciated, when we are supported.’’

With Biklen’s help, facilitated communication spread through the world of disability services with a near-­religious fervor. At Syracuse, he set up an institute that trained teachers, parents and social workers. Among its earliest disciples was Anna’s mother, Sandra. When she heard about the method, she set out for one of Biklen’s workshops on the night train. Back in Michigan, she had Anna serve as the videographer of her early sessions.

At the peak of F.C.’s popularity, a workshop could draw 1,000 people, says Christine Ashby, who now runs Biklen’s institute. By October 1991, the technique had made its way into this magazine, in an article that began with a boy in Syracuse who was thought to have an I.Q. of 37 until he started using facilitated communication; he received a standing ovation when he graduated from high school. Three months later, Diane Sawyer did an Emmy-­winning segment on the method for ‘‘Primetime Live’’ on ABC. ‘‘For decades, autism has been a dark mystery,’’ she told her viewers, ‘‘a disorder that seems to turn children in on themselves, against the world. Tonight, however, you are going to see something that has changed that. Call it a miracle. Call it an awakening.’’

Not everyone was convinced. Howard Shane, a speech pathologist and professor at Harvard Medical School, was at a conference in Stockholm in the summer of 1990 at which Crossley presented her data. He had been trying to help nonverbal people communicate for more than 15 years, using keyboards linked to voice synthesizers and other tools: Press a button, get a word. In Sweden, Crossley claimed that she had made stupendous breakthroughs just by squeezing a shoulder or cradling a hand.

‘‘It just didn’t fit with anything that I or anybody had ever seen before,’’ Shane says now. ‘‘Either she saw something that nobody saw, or there was something wrong with me, in that I was dismissing people as being retarded when all you had to do was just believe that they could do it.’’ He snorted as he recalled Crossley’s presentation: ‘‘We were sitting in the back of the room, and I turned to my friend and said, ‘This is the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.’ And then I said, ‘But what harm could it do?’ I actually said that to her. I said, ‘But what harm can it do?’ ’’

Shane got his first call from a district attorney a few months later. A nonverbal adult in Northampton, Mass., had accused someone of sexual assault while typing with her hand supported. The story turned out to be untrue, but it was not the only accusation of this kind. Facilitated communication arrived in the United States during a hysteria over child sexual abuse, fueled by memories ‘‘recovered’’ during hypnosis or elicited from children. By the end of 1994, some 60 users of facilitated communication had made claims of sexual abuse.

As these cases multiplied, Shane and others began to look more closely at whether facilitated communication could be trusted. When Betsy Wheaton, an autistic 16-year-old from Maine, typed out that her father ‘‘makes me hold his penissss,’’ Shane, brought in to evaluate her, arrived with a battery of tests. First, he showed Wheaton and her facilitator, a speech and language trainer named Janyce Boynton, a set of pictures — a shoe, a spoon, a ball — and asked Wheaton to identify them. In some trials, Wheaton was shown the same pictures as Boynton; in others, she was shown different ones that Boynton wouldn’t see. No matter which she saw, the results were the same: Wheaton spelled out whatever was on the pictures shown to Boynton.

Next, Shane started asking Wheaton for information that Boynton didn’t know — the color of her parents’ car, the names of her family pets. Wheaton pointed to the letter board with Boynton’s help, but her answers were inaccurate. For a final test, Shane took Wheaton into the hall and showed her a key and other things from his pocket. Back in the room, he asked her to name the objects she had seen. With Boynton supporting her arm, she failed to spell out anything at all.

The results of these experiments matched those from published studies that used a similar controlled approach — asking typers to name objects their facilitators either could or couldn’t see. In almost every case, it seemed that the messages nonverbal people typed were not their own. One early review of this research found just four subjects whose communications might be valid out of 126 people tested. A subsequent review of 19 studies of facilitated communication performed during the 1990s found zero validations across 183 tests.

It looked as if the technique had been debunked. Professional societies put out formal statements questioning or condemning its use. In late 1993, ‘‘Frontline’’ aired a special that told Betsy Wheaton’s story, among others, and suggested that facilitated communication was an elaborate display of what psychologists call the ideomotor effect, in which an external suggestion or a person’s beliefs or expectations trigger unconscious movement: The facilitator was guiding the typing, even if she didn’t know it. In early 1994, ‘‘60 Minutes’’ ran a similar exposé called ‘‘Less Than a Miracle.’’ Public funding for the technique in schools started to dry up. Attendance at Biklen’s workshops in Syracuse dropped sharply.

Even Anne McDonald’s story turned out to have a set of complicating facts. Before the ‘‘string’’ and ‘‘quince’’ test that won her case in court, she was subjected to a series of investigations that came to different, often contradictory conclusions. Cheryl Critchley, a freelance journalist, has documented several harrowing accusations made by McDonald and Crossley’s other typers. McDonald said the hospital superintendent had tried to smother her with a pillow, and another young woman said he had forced a noxious liquid down her throat.

The backlash against facilitated communication ‘‘was horrible,’’ says Anna’s mother, Sandra, who still acts as a facilitator with clients and testified in an F.C.-­related sexual-­abuse case in Michigan as recently as 2008. (She also traveled to Australia in 2005 to meet with Crossley and McDonald.) ‘‘In the early 1990s, people were so excited, and we were able to get a lot of people going on at least some communication. Then came the pushback, and a lot of schools said you can’t do it anymore and literally took away the only communication system that had ever worked for many of their kids.’’

D.J. is about five feet tall, with skinny arms and legs and the lolling head of a punch-drunk boxer. He has a tendency to rock from side to side and to bang his face against his knees; his nose looks as if it has been broken once or twice. When he is anxious or upset, he puts his hands in his mouth and bites them, leaving open sores. In a better mood, he likes to play with plastic coat hangers or scoot over to the refrigerator for a snack. D.J. loves to eat; he loves to be outside; he loves to look up at the ceiling lights.

Sitting at the keyboard, D.J. also seemed to have a lot to say. His messages were simple and misspelled at first, but his skill and fluency improved. Eventually he could hit a letter every second, and if Anna guessed the word before he finished typing, he would hit the ‘‘Y’’ key to confirm. Anna brought books for him to read, Maya Angelou and others, and discovered that he read like a savant — 10 pages every minute. (She turned the pages for him.) They discussed the possibility of his enrolling in a G.E.D. program.

As D.J. came into his own, Anna kept her mother posted on his progress. In the spring of 2010, Sandra asked if D.J. might like to give a paper for a panel she was organizing at a conference of the Society for Disability Studies in Philadelphia. The panel was on Article 21 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities, which lays out the right to freedom of expression and opinion. D.J. wasn’t sure he could do it, Anna said, but she convinced him he should try.

For the next six weeks, they worked together on his presentation — a one-page essay that D.J. wrote with Anna’s support and constant feedback over many sessions at his adult day program. In early June, D.J. traveled to the conference with his mother and brother, and then Wesley read D.J.’s paper to an audience of some 40 people. ‘‘The right to communication is the right to hope,’’ the essay said. ‘‘I am jumping for joy knowing I can talk, but don’t minimize how humiliating it can be to know people jump to the conclusion I am mentally disabled.’’ In Philadelphia, Anna and her mother typed with D.J., too, and introduced him to other users of facilitated communication. Two of D.J.’s fellow typers on the panel, Jacob Pratt and Hope Block, had just become engaged. They had been going on ‘‘supported dates’’ — flirting with each other through F.C., planning get-­togethers, negotiating intimacy — for about a year.

Anna found that her relationship with D.J. was getting deeper, too. All the time they spent working on the essay, all the books they read together and all their conversations had changed the mood between them. ‘‘I began to gradually be aware that I was having romantic feelings,’’ she would later testify. ‘‘I became aware of things when he wrote the essay. It wasn’t all that original — people who had had the same experience had said similar things — but with all the spelling mistakes, he had a way of putting things.’’

She had also grown more involved with D.J.’s family. When P. came down with walking pneumonia and needed urgent care, Anna showed up at the hospital. At one point, P. baked a pie for Anna’s family. ‘‘I could have called her Aunt Anna or Cousin Anna,’’ Wesley said during a deposition. ‘‘She was like family.’’ In October, P. went with Anna and D.J. to a second conference in Milwaukee. The paper that he gave there, read aloud by Anna’s father, ended up being published in a peer-­reviewed academic journal.

That fall, D.J. started sitting in on a 400-­level course in African-­American literature at Rutgers. A Rutgers undergraduate named Sheronda Jones, recruited by Anna, used F.C. to help him do his homework. ‘‘He pretty much read the books,’’ Jones remembered in a statement to the police. ‘‘I can’t tell you what he read. And he typed out the information.’’ She added, ‘‘I know because one of my roommates was in the class with him, and they pretty much wrote some of the same things.’’

A man who had been said to have the mental capacity of a toddler was now on the conference circuit and taking college classes. At last the world could get to know D.J. and understand his mind. ‘‘He’s an extremely ethical person — it’s one of the things that impressed me about him,’’ Anna said in court. ‘‘You know how you can meet somebody who’s extremely physically attractive, and then when you get to know them, they have such a horrible personality that they don’t really look attractive to you? It works the same way in reverse. If somebody has an interesting, engaging mind and good heart and a beautiful soul, that is transformative. It shows through, and you love the person. And so you love being close to them, and you love the body that they’re in, because that’s the body that they have.’’

Even as Anna came to feel this transformation, even as it seemed to her that D.J.’s world had opened up, her relationship with his family was not as stable as it seemed. One problem was that no matter how much progress D.J. made with Anna, his typing never worked with his mother or brother. They spent many hours training in F.C., but neither had success. Anna typed with D.J.; Anna’s mother typed with D.J.; Sheronda Jones typed with D.J. But somehow, P. and Wesley always failed.

Wesley remembered that he would take hold of D.J.’s arm, and they would type a single word together: the. Then nothing. Anna, he recalled, would tell him: ‘‘You have to keep practicing. You have to sit down and work with him and just continue at it. D.J. prefers to facilitate with some people more than others.’’ P. said that when she tried to grab D.J.’s hand, he would pull it away or scratch her. Anna told her to stop mothering him.

In January 2011, Wesley grew so frustrated that he went online to find the video about F.C. that Anna had shown in class two years before. He wanted to see how people helped the woman in the film. ‘‘I was looking for a model to pattern myself after,’’ he said during a deposition. But when he started searching, he came across a different film — not ‘‘Autism Is a World,’’ but the ‘‘Frontline’’ investigation from 1993.

Other things raised Wesley’s suspicions, too. Some of D.J.’s messages didn’t seem as if they came from him. D.J. typed with Anna that he didn’t like gospel music, but Wesley knew his brother loved to sway in church, doing what Wesley called the ‘‘Stevie Wonder dance.’’ D.J. also typed, through Anna, that he enjoyed red wine — especially from a label called Fat Bastard. But Wesley spent Communion Sundays with D.J. and said he never showed much interest in drinking wine. ‘‘It seemed very class-­based,’’ Wesley said. ‘‘It seemed very much of what she liked but not what [D.J.] liked.’’

While Wesley harbored private doubts, P. began to feel put off by Anna’s interventions. They quibbled over the clothes D.J. wore and the records he listened to, and they debated ­whether D.J. should find his own place to live. I’m his mother, P. said. Let him be a man, Anna told her.

In March 2011, Anna invited D.J. to Rutgers to give a presentation about his disabilities. Students asked him questions:

‘‘What are your hopes and dreams?’’

D.J. typed that he would like to go to college, become a writer and work in disability activism.

‘‘Would you like to be in a romantic relationship?’’

‘‘I want that more than anything,’’ D.J. answered. ‘‘But I don’t know if that’s possible for people with disabilities like mine.’’

That was the moment Anna knew she couldn’t keep her feelings to herself. ‘‘I wanted to put my arms around him and say: ‘You can have that. I love you,’ ’’ she later testified. A week later, at his afternoon day program, Anna finally told D.J. how she felt. ‘‘I love you, too,’’ he typed. She said she had known that for a long time, and he said he had known it, too. And then he typed, ‘‘So now what?’’

They went back and forth on this question. ‘‘He grilled me on how much I really loved him, how committed I was to him, how I felt about my husband,’’ Anna wrote in an account of their relationship that she compiled six months later at her lawyer’s request. D.J. wanted to know if she would someday marry him. ‘‘I said: ‘Please, I love you very much, but please don’t ask me that just now. I need time to think through everything.’ He said that he was sorry. He didn’t mean to push that hard. It was childish of him.’’

After many hours of discussion and several visits to the day program, Anna finally convinced D.J. that she meant all that she had been saying. ‘‘O.K., I believe you really do love me,’’ he typed. ‘‘But are you physically attracted to me?’’

‘‘That broke my heart all over again,’’ she said in court. ‘‘I said, ‘I’m in love with you the whole way.’ Then he said, ‘Kiss me,’ and I did. He said, ‘Kiss me again.’ I kissed him again.’’

D.J. typed, ‘‘Do you think it’s even possible with my cerebral palsy for us to make love?’’

They met the following Sunday at D.J.’s house, while his mother was at church. They tried to kiss while lying down on D.J.’s bed, on the theory that it would be easier, given his impairments. But D.J. kept sitting up, and then he lowered himself onto the floor. Anna offered him the keyboard and asked if anything was wrong. Nothing’s wrong, he typed, he was very happy, but also overwhelmed — he needed a minute. Anna said O.K., and D.J. scooted out into the hall. ‘‘Look, whatever we’re going to do, you set the pace,’’ she told him. ‘‘You call the shots. This is all about what feels right for you. I just love being close to you in whatever way works for you and for your body. No pressure.’’

A few minutes later she was naked.

‘‘I’ve dreamed about this,’’ he typed.

At his request, she said, she pushed down his pants, loosened his diaper and performed oral sex on him. They never finished — ‘‘I was close,’’ D.J. typed — but they had tickets for a disability-­related film festival at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They were going to see ‘‘Wretches & Jabberers,’’ a 2010 documentary about F.C. produced by Douglas Biklen, the founder of the Syracuse institute.

A week later, Anna recalled, the couple tried to have sex in Anna’s office at Conklin Hall, with condoms, a blanket and an exercise mat. It didn’t work, and they ended up just sitting on the floor together, Anna talking and D.J. typing. Anna asked him if he might want to see some pornography, ‘‘to see what things looked like and different positions people used and that sort of thing.’’ She said she wouldn’t want to pay for porn or watch anything offensive, but that she would be O.K. with finding free clips on the Internet that depicted couples engaging in mutually pleasurable intercourse. He demurred, typing out that in his view the women in porn are being exploited, and that, besides, Anna was more beautiful than any porn star, and he really wanted to be thinking only about her when they finally made love.

The following Sunday in her office, it finally happened. D.J. ‘‘was very happy with what was going on,’’ she said in court. If he needed to say something, he would bang the floor, and she would pause to set him up with the keyboard. ‘‘It was a few hours from getting undressed to afterglow,’’ she said. When they were finished, he typed: ‘‘I feel alive for the first time in my life.’’

It’s not that Anna didn’t know of F.C.’s checkered reputation. But like many in that insular and passionate community of users, she thought the method had been unfairly pushed aside. Anna knew it worked, firsthand.

She had watched her mother use F.C. for 20 years. In 2000, Sandra introduced her to an F.C. user with autism named Nick Pentzell. Anna was teaching at Temple University. He sat in on her classes. (She also typed with him herself.) At Rutgers, Newark, Anna worked regularly with several people other than D.J., including a nonverbal teenage boy named Zach DeMeo. Zach, now 22, has autism and lost his speech while a toddler. Like D.J., he met Anna through an older brother who was enrolled at Rutgers. Soon they were having weekly or biweekly sessions at Anna’s office. ‘‘It changed his life,’’ says Zach’s mother, Toni, a substitute teacher on Long Island. ‘‘She was so selfless and devoted. She saw us on weekends. She left her family to help my son.’’ Anna and Zach have been friends for six years, and they stayed in touch even as she prepared for trial. ‘‘She speaks to my son as an equal,’’ Toni says. ‘‘She treats him as a human being. If he told me he was in love with her, I would believe him.’’

As for D.J., once Anna decided that he could express himself — once he told her several things that she said she could not have figured out herself, like his nickname and his date of birth — then her mind was free of doubt. ‘‘I knew [D.J.] was the author of his typing,’’ she said in court. ‘‘Why would I question that?’’

Those who do raise doubts about F.C. tend to go too far, she wrote in a 2011 paper for Disability Studies Quarterly: ‘‘Although opponents of F.C. present themselves as engaging in scientific debate, some instances of continuing anti-­F.C. expression meet the criteria to count as hate speech.’’ She conceded that there were studies showing that the method didn’t work, but there were others that indicated just the opposite. The skeptics’ dismissal of F.C., she argued, their insistence that it never works, could be taken as a form of ableist oppression.

‘‘We just need to recognize that research does a thing,’’ Christine Ashby, the head of the institute in Syracuse, said at last year’s annual summer conference for typers and facilitators. ‘‘Research gives us a piece of information, but it’s very dangerous when that piece of information gets used to take away people’s way of gaining access to the world.’’",REAL
Terry Gross and the Art of Opening Up,"This morning’s interview was with Sarah Hepola, the author of a memoir of alcoholism, ‘‘Blackout: Remembering the Things I Drank to Forget.’’ I went into the control room to listen. ‘‘Terry will be with you in a second,’’ an engineer told Hepola, who was waiting in a studio in Dallas. As a practicality, Gross performs most of her interviews long distance.

The control room had an anticipatory backstage feel. Moments earlier, a director was gesturing like a conductor, asking an engineer to ‘‘Hit it!’’ with an audio clip. In high school, Gross wanted to be a lyricist; one of the things she loves about radio is that it has ‘‘just enough theater.’’ ‘‘Fresh Air’’ is intensely collaborative, and many staff members have been there for years, including the executive producer Danny Miller, who started as an intern in 1978.

‘‘Hello, is this Sarah? Hi, this is Terry Gross. I’ll be doing the interview with you today.’’ Gross’s voice is briskly warm, with a luster that conveys the pleasure she takes in it as an instrument. For years, she took singing lessons; she told her instructor that she wasn’t trying to become good at singing — ‘‘I just want to be inside a song, to the extent that I can be. To just have my body inside a song.’’ The goal was raptness in a form she loves.

‘‘If I ask you anything too personal — I know your book is personal, but say I cross a line, just tell me, and we’ll move on,’’ she said to Hepola. ‘‘And you can tell me anything on the record or off the record. O.K.? Swell.’’

I settled in to listen. Along a long panel of buttons in the front of the room was a white plastic square with a big red arrow under it and a label that said, TALK TO TERRY BUTTON.

‘‘My No. 1 fantasy of all time is to be interviewed by Terry Gross.’’

‘‘I have gone so far as to rehearse answers to specific questions. … ’’

‘‘Every single time I hear a Terry Gross interview, I wonder what it would be like for her to do some research on me and do an interview.’’

When I started doing ‘‘Terry Gross’’ Google searches, I was struck by how often this wish is expressed. Hepola told Gross, ‘‘This was just as wonderful as I’d dreamed it would be for 10 years,’’ and I wondered what her interview dream had been like.

‘‘I have this very specific memory of being in a coffee shop in the West Village and working on a section of my book about adolescence,’’ Hepola said to me on the phone. ‘‘And, bing! I heard Terry in my head. She was like: ‘This is amazing. No one has really ever talked about adolescence in the way that you’re talking about it right now.’ ’’ At that point, Hepola was early in her sobriety. Through Gross, who was often in her earbuds, she was finding her way back to the kind of close conversations she had once drunk her way to.

Matthew Weiner, the creator of ‘‘Mad Men,’’ has been among the most frequent guests on ‘‘Fresh Air.’’ He imagined being interviewed by Gross years before it first happened, and once it did, ‘‘you’re like: Oh, this is my fantasy of a conversation,’’ Weiner told me. ‘‘I’m not even talking about people hearing it. I’m talking about actually having the conversation.’’

‘‘Having the conversation’’ — that’s what’s compelling about the wish. It’s a wish not for recognition but for an experience. It’s a wish for Gross to locate your genius, even if that genius has not yet been expressed. It’s a wish to be seen as in a wish to be understood.

The interview wish is as old as the form itself. Journalistic interviews in the United States increasingly began to appear in the 1860s. Before that, when reporters talked to people, they typically didn’t quote them. Once interviewing started, it became a craze. It had its own practitioners, often women, who were thought to be better at drawing people out. Henry James’s journalists were almost all ‘‘interviewers,’’ and his characters, like Selah Tarrant in ‘‘The Bostonians,’’ crave their scrutiny: ‘‘The wish of his soul was that he might be interviewed,’’ James wrote.

At first the interview was regarded as a particularly American phenomenon — pushy, but fair too, because it involved the cooperation of the interviewee, not just a sneaky reporter. The practice shifted radically after World War II. Television gained popularity — the age of the broadcast interviewer began. And psychoanaly­sis — that other great innovation in opening people up — was being practiced more widely.

Gross’s interviews have often been compared to therapy. That’s in part because of her seemingly neutral stance, but also because of the feeling of safety she gives her interviewees. Once in a while, a guest confesses to Gross that he’s confiding something for the very first time. ‘‘I don’t know that I’ve said that to anyone,’’ the ‘‘Project Runway’’ host Tim Gunn told Gross in 2014, of spending time in a psychiatric hospital as an adolescent. Gross’s response was as affecting as Gunn’s story. She handles confessions quietly, acknowledging the weight of what’s been said without drawing undue attention to it.

Gross herself started seeing a therapist several years ago. ‘‘When she asks me a question that gets exactly to the heart of what I’m trying to say, but maybe haven’t articulated clearly, it just feels so good,’’ Gross told me. ‘‘My ideal as an interviewer is to be the person who gets it. Like somebody can tell you something really personal,’’ she continued, and ‘‘you can ask them something that can help them comfortably move to the next place and go deeper.’’ She went on: ‘‘Hearing someone speak really personally, and having that affirm your experience as a sexual person, or as a sick person, or just as a person trying to get through daily life, is really valuable. And I think that’s why we turn to literature, I think that’s why we turn to film, beyond the entertainment it gives us.’’

She loves interviewing artists, she told me, because they are ‘‘the people we designate to open up their lives for examination so we can understand better who we are.’’ They offer up their own stories as ‘‘what Updike called ‘specimen lives,’ ’’ she said. ‘‘Examples of what it’s like to be human.’’

Gross was born in 1951 in Brooklyn. She grew up in Sheepshead Bay, between Avenues X and Y. It was a new neighborhood, with postwar apartment buildings that went up on the site of an old racetrack. As a little girl, Gross loved realistic fiction (Beverly Cleary, the Betsy-Tacy series) and would retreat to the couch with a book when her family visited relatives.

Gross’s father helped run a family business selling materials to hatmakers. Her mother had worked as a secretary but quit after Gross’s older brother was born, and later Gross would seek the life outside the home that wasn’t available to her mother.

As a freshman at SUNY Buffalo, Gross wanted to write. But she was worried she wasn’t good enough to be great, and she struggled to find a subject. At the same time, she was shedding her ‘‘good girl’’ identity. She tried being a hippie — ‘‘I was too inhibited to be very convincing at it. And too Sheepshead Bay, probably’’ — and she tried drugs. One of the first times she dropped LSD, she determinedly brought along paper and pen: ‘‘I’m going to have a subject,’’ she recalls thinking. ‘‘All of my writerly inhibitions are going to open up, and my talent is going to be released!’’ LSD didn’t help her writing, but for Gross it was a beneficially ‘‘immersive experience.’’

In the first months after she graduated in 1972, Gross floundered. She had married, but would soon divorce; she was fired from a job teaching eighth grade after only six weeks (she couldn’t control the class). But then she discovered radio. One afternoon, about a year after she finished school, she was sitting in her house in Buffalo listening to ‘‘Womanpower,’’ a feminist program on WBFO, the university station. One of her roommates was a guest, and she came out as gay on the air. Gross was surprised by the revelation, but more so by the way her roommate had delivered it: sitting before a microphone in a radio studio.

Gross, who had wanted to do ‘‘something in media’’ but hadn’t known how to begin, was intrigued. Through her roommate, she learned there was an opening on ‘‘Womanpower,’’ and Gross started on the show as a volunteer. Just over a year later, she moved to a program called ‘‘This Is Radio.’’ The show’s superpower was a phone line that allowed the staff to call anywhere in New York State toll-free. Gross would scour the Village Voice classifieds for people who might be interesting — jazz musicians offering lessons, a tattoo artist — and call them up and interview them. During college Gross had shed some of her innate reserve, but ‘‘I still was just inhibitively shy,’’ she said. ‘‘With a microphone, I wasn’t shy.’’

In 1975, Gross moved to Philadelphia to take over ‘‘Fresh Air,’’ which was created by a former WBFO colleague (NPR began distributing it as a daily show in 1987). Gross says she was ‘‘always inquisitive,’’ and her curiosity vibrates on the surface of old tape. In a 1980 conversation that was rebroadcast in September, Gross, still in her 20s, called the horror-film maker Wes Craven. Craven was not yet famous — this was years before ‘‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’’ — but Gross had recently seen his slasher film ‘‘The Last House on the Left.’’ She was so disturbed by its sadism that she wanted to find out who made it. Craven told her he was bothered by a sense that America had become ‘‘immune to violence,’’ and he wanted to show the reality of it.

‘‘I really understand what you’re saying,’’ Gross told him, ‘‘and I know that the movies I grew up on, even, like, the World War II and World War I movies, people were killed without any blood ever coming out.’’ Her response indicated that she was not out to attack Craven but to explore his motivations.

‘‘You know, it went back to something that happened to me when I was a kid,’’ he ventured. ‘‘I don’t know whether you’d be interested in hearing it—’’

Of course she’d be interested in hearing it! We all would. What emerged was a textured and totally creepy story of a mail-order bow-and-arrow set and a rat that took too long to die.

Gross’s impulse to explore what provokes her — the impulse that drove her to pick up the landline and call Craven — underlies her 40 years of interviews. Ira Glass, who was my boss at ‘‘This American Life,’’ observes that Gross brings ‘‘real questions she personally has been wondering about’’ to the kind of interviews that tell us ‘‘what should we make of the latest news from Iraq or Syria’’ — as well as the good editorial sense of when to let an expert ‘‘march off in unplanned directions.’’ He adds: ‘‘There’ve been times when I’ve relistened, just to hear the order of the questions and to figure out what was planned and unplanned. Like a magician sitting in on another guy’s act for two nights so he can figure out the trick, to steal it.’’ Glass singles out Gross’s ‘‘great improviser’s performance chops. Not surprising that she loves jazz artists and stand-up comedians so much. She’s their journalist peer.’’

In June 2014, Gross interviewed Hillary Clinton, who was then promoting her memoir, ‘‘Hard Choices.’’ Gross interviews very few politicians because it is difficult to get them to speak candidly. When she does, she moves into a register that is authoritative but no less authentic. Gross noted that as a senator Clinton didn’t support gay marriage, but as secretary of state she emerged as an advocate for L.G.B.T. rights. ‘‘She’s on the international stage, where gay people are still being executed in some countries, or certainly imprisoned, and she’s coming out not only for lesbian and gay rights but she’s adding the T,’’ Gross said to me. ‘‘I thought that was brave and remarkable. But I wanted her to bridge the gap.’’

Gross framed the question by asking if there were things Clinton believed in personally but couldn’t come out and support as a politician — like gay marriage? ‘‘And I think she totally misinterpreted it as me trying to say, ‘You’re such a hypocrite.’ ’’

The exchange became rivetingly uncomfortable, with Clinton growing increasingly defensive as Gross asked whether her views on gay marriage had evolved, or whether she was responding to changes in American public opinion. Clinton was stubbornly evasive: ‘‘I said I’m an American, so we all evolved.’’ The back and forth continued:

Gross: So, that’s one for ‘‘you changed your mind’’? Clinton: You know, I really — I have to say, I think you are very persistent, but you are playing with my words and playing with what is such an important issue.

When the interview ended, Gross and her producers asked themselves, ‘‘Are we going to keep that in the edit?’’ Yes, they decided: ‘‘Maybe there’s not a really satisfactory, conclusive answer,’’ but ‘‘it felt like a real moment.’’ Gross went on: ‘‘Even if the real moment isn’t somebody being really honest and forthcoming and introspective, a real moment of friction, a real moment of tension, is still a real moment.’’

Occasionally the ‘‘real moments’’ can be awkward for Gross. In July, in an interview with the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, Gross began laughing in response to a story he told about being yelled at by a teacher. ‘‘See, it sounds like you’re laughing because, like, it’s funny if you’ve never been in the environment,’’ Coates said. Some on social media pegged Gross as a clueless white lady. But the exchange was constructive. Gross was simply reacting, and then listening as Coates explained his perception of her reaction. In doing so, he illuminated an experience of growing up in a culture of fear and violence.

On ‘‘Fresh Air,’’ we listen to Gross grapple with the most complex questions of existence — racial prejudice, faith, family, illness, morality, betrayal, gratitude. In 2011, when Maurice Sendak was 83, Gross called him at his home in Connecticut. What was meant to be a short conversation about his new book, ‘‘Bumble-Ardy,’’ became a meditation on his nearness to death. You feel Sendak looking over into it from his living room.

Sendak: Oh, God, there are so many beautiful things in this world which I will have to leave when I die, but I’m ready, I’m ready, I’m ready. … You know, I have to tell you something. Gross: Go ahead. Sendak: You are the only person I have ever dealt with in terms of being interviewed or talking who brings this out in me. There’s something very unique and special in you, which I so trust. When I heard that you were going to interview me or that you wanted to, I was really, really pleased.

Sendak is scratchy and emotional, and Gross is gentle with him. ‘‘And almost certainly, I’ll go before you go,’’ he tells her. ‘‘So I won’t have to miss you.’’

When Gross was growing up, she and her mother would take the subway to the department stores in Downtown Brooklyn twice a year, ‘‘once for your fall wardrobe and once for your spring.’’ After they shopped, they would have two sandwiches at Junior’s for lunch — corned beef and shrimp salad — and ‘‘split them half and half.’’ Years later, when Gross’s mother was living in Florida and sick with lung cancer, ‘‘I took her shopping, and I helped her on and off with her clothes. It might not sound like a big deal to other people, but it made me so sad.’’ She continued: ‘‘It made me so sad, the way the roles flipped.’’

Eventually her mother’s mind started to go, in part because of the chemotherapy. ‘‘As she lost some of her cognitive abilities, I thought of myself as having duets with her. I’d have these conversations where I knew that she knew the answers to the questions. I knew we were on safe territory,’’ she told me. ‘‘I knew my part, she knew her part and we could converse that way.’’

Gross and I were alone in the studio, a large room with sage green walls. Sunlight was filtered by screens, and the soundproofing sealed us off from the world. It was as if we had zipped ourselves inside a tent. We were talking about the deaths of Gross’s parents, and I asked about Sendak, in relation to something I’d been wondering about — the interplay between an interview and her private life. ‘‘I didn’t think of this until later,’’ Gross said. ‘‘But the interview that I had with him was in a way the conversation I never had with my parents.’’

She went on: ‘‘I try not to confuse the two. I try not to equate the interview with real life. But at the same time, there’s an intimacy in the interview — like, I’m telling you things that people I work with probably don’t know, because it doesn’t come up. I would tell them if they asked, but it’s just not a part of what you talk about in day-to-day work life necessarily.’’

We had plans for dinner, and down the hall, in her office, Gross collected her things. She wheeled a crate-size cart of books and papers out to the parking lot, then transferred the contents to her trunk. The steering wheel was hot, and Gross put on puffy black winter gloves with leopard-print lining to protect her hands. Then she drove unexpectedly fast down Old City’s narrow streets.

On a typical day, Gross is at the office from 8:45 to 5:45. She and her husband, Francis Davis, who is a music critic, will go out for dinner (not fancy places: ‘‘We like diners and delis’’), and then Gross will continue working at home, preparing for the next day’s interview in the living room. She clarifies her thoughts first thing in the morning in the shower. That’s when she asks herself: What do I care about? What in all of this research is meaningful? It’s important to be away from her notes when she does this. She emerges from the shower with her ‘‘major destination points.’’ Then she goes to her office and refers back to her notes — sheafs of facts; dog-eared, marked-up books — for the details. Then she does the interview. And then she is inundated by the other daily tasks of running a radio show. The next day, she does it all again. ‘‘And that’s been my whole adult life,’’ she told me. It’s part grind and part devotion. As a young woman, Gross wanted to find ‘‘a passion that could become my work.’’ She decided not to have children. ‘‘I do feel like I was part of the first generation that actually had a choice. Where we would not be seen as either tragic or lacking in some way for not having children.’’

The last time I visited Gross at the station, it was a Friday. She was wearing a loose denim jacket, and we were sitting across a table from each other, talking about weekend plans. ‘‘Friday nights and Saturday nights Francis and I usually spend alone together because the weeks are just so crazy and so hectic and so noisy, like I have so many people in my head’’ — she cupped her hands next to her ears like headphones. ‘‘You know what I mean?’’

‘‘Like in your ears,’’ I said, nodding. Sometimes, doing radio, your head falls to the pillow with someone’s voice still collected there.

Gross and Davis met in 1976 at a record store near the station. ‘‘As I was falling in love with him, I also fell in love with his writing,’’ Gross told me on another day. Davis is also devoted to his work — in the pre-laptop era, he would lug a huge typewriter on vacations. The two always try to have dinner together. When Gross was younger, and working late nights, ‘‘I would call him, and we’d kind of have dinner together, because I’d talk to him the whole time I was eating dinner. So we’d be having dinner together whether we were in the same room or not.’’

That weekend Gross had plans to see a four-and-a-half-hour opera, Rossini’s ‘‘William Tell.’’ She discovered opera only recently, and wishes she had found it when she was still taking singing lessons with an instructor, who died a few years ago. From him she learned about head tones and chest tones and how, when you’re singing, your voice ‘‘should resonate in the bones of your face.’’ She added: ‘‘When I was taking singing lessons, I felt like, No one’s having more pleasure in singing than I am. I sound horrible, but that doesn’t matter. I’m enjoying it.’’

Outside the window, Philadelphia tourists were gliding by on Segways. Across from me, Gross was serene. ‘‘I don’t know if it’s a function of age or temperament,’’ she said, ‘‘but I’m no longer seeking those major exclamatory notes of pleasure. I want a life that has pleasure contained within it.’’

After Gross and I talked, we went for her usual walk around the block. It was a hot evening, and the sun was blazing as we passed the fortress of the Federal Reserve. And at that moment, the conversation got very personal, for me. I wound up telling Gross a secret. While I hadn’t planned to do this, afterward I wondered whether some subconscious part of me had orchestrated it — whether, in some pathetic way, I was enacting my own interview wish.

As I was about to make the confession, I said something like, ‘‘O.K., I’ll tell you, because you’re Terry Gross,’’ which I immediately regretted. It was as if I was talking to Terry Gross the national interviewer. And maybe I was. I’ve projected, the same as any listener. But we had spent time together, and she was no longer just a character to me. I wanted to confide in her because I wanted to be close to her, even as I was aware that this, too, could be as reflective of the roles we were playing as of ‘‘reality.’’

We were on a walk of predetermined length, undertaken for professional reasons. There were implicit boundaries. And on that sidewalk, I felt as if I was getting an answer to my question about whether, and how, the intimacy of such moments carried over into the world outside the studio, for both Gross and her subjects. Because while I was here with Gross as a function of my work, I was speaking to her from the heart of my life. It felt heightened, in the way that reporting does, but also scary, in the way that vulnerability does.

All the time we walked, Gross was asking questions, and offering advice, which is different from on the radio. When we finished the walk, and I was leaving, I became nervously formal. When I reached to shake her hand, she very simply took mine in both of hers.

I felt so awkward for days after the exchange had happened. Was it going to ruin the ongoing interaction? What did she think of me? It spoke to something important in the piece, but it was self-indulgent. Was it even worth including?

Should You Be Allowed to Invest in a Lawsuit?,"Over the last century, many have come to see lawsuits as a means of expression, a political weapon and a powerful deterrent against those who might do wrong. And yet creating lawsuits is not the same as creating something like the Bug. Litigation is a zero-sum industry — every dollar in damages taken home by the winner, minus fees, must be wrung out of the loser. Litigation also helps shape legal precedent, defining the terms under which civil justice may be sought. It’s hard to imagine how billions in outside capital won’t wind up changing the justice system. The only question is how.

To help me understand what a quick coupler does, David Ridley, a straw-haired Miller mechanic in a jumpsuit, arranged a demonstration. Beside a chain-link fence near the Miller UK factory, he had set up a yellow Komatsu digging machine, of the scale favored by demolition crews and construction-minded toddlers. Attached to the end of its hydraulic arm was a digging bucket. Ridley picked up a sledgehammer and tapped a wrist-like joint, then slid out one of the two cylindrical pins holding the bucket in place. The pin’s chrome surface was coated with grease. He hoisted it onto his shoulder. It weighed about 100 pounds.

‘‘How many people want to be changing that all day?’’ Ridley asked.

Ridley then tapped out the other pin, climbed up into the Komatsu’s cab and revved the diesel engine up to a gentle hum. He swung the yellow arm over to the Bug and positioned it within the flanges so the four holes aligned. He connected some hydraulic hoses to deliver power to the Bug’s innards and tapped the two pins back in. Then, using the Bug-enhanced Komatsu, Ridley picked the bucket back up. Thanks to the Bug, it was an idiotproof process. A bright yellow safety latch tightened neatly over one of the pins. It took less than 10 seconds.

Before quick couplers, operators would waste 30 minutes or more each time they wanted to switch out a bucket or other tool. Miller’s first quick coupler, nicknamed the Magnificent Seven, came to market in the early 1990s, reducing that time to seven seconds. They also solved another problem. Previously, a construction company with three kinds of machines would need to buy three lines of buckets to match. Quick couplers soon created universal compatibility among product lines: A Komatsu bucket, for example, could now be slapped onto a Volvo machine.

Caterpillar soon took notice. Compared with Miller, Cat is a leviathan: It’s one of the 200 largest corporations in the world, with more than 100,000 employees. In 1997, according to legal filings from Miller, Cat approached a Miller executive at a trade show in Germany. The two companies began to talk about having Miller contract to supply Cat with a fully automatic coupler that the companies ultimately brought to market as the Pin Grabber Plus. Over the years, Cat (by Miller’s count) bought about 27,000 of these units for resale to its own customers, generating upward of $100 million in revenue. Each generation of couplers had to mesh perfectly with the specifications of Cat’s machines, so the companies’ engineers exchanged technical drawings, and their executives hobnobbed over dinners in North­umberland and Illinois. By 2006, Caterpillar was ordering about 10,000 Miller couplers a year. According to Miller, Caterpillar orders accounted for as much as 28 percent of its business and a larger share of its profits.

Then, in the midst of the 2008 downturn, Cat, according to Miller’s version of events, abruptly told Miller that its couplers would no longer be needed. Cat had designed its own coupler in-house. (Cat’s filings deny that its coupler used Miller’s proprietary technology and say that it was allowed to terminate its contract with Miller at any time.) Keith Miller, the company’s founder, was gutted. With the loss of his largest customer, Miller earnings swung from an eight-million-pound profit to a million-pound loss. Miller took on debt and dismissed more than half of its employees.

A year after Cat broke the news, Keith Miller saw its competing coupler for the first time. ‘‘It wasn’t just similar,’’ he told me. ‘‘It was a replica of ours.’’ Miller felt certain that the new Cat couplers made use of his company’s know-how. He sued Caterpillar for breach of contract, fraud and misappropriating trade secrets. But he quickly learned what it means to sue a company as large as Cat. Caterpillar’s lawyers made dozens of preliminary filings. They claimed that Miller had delivered ‘‘substandard’’ couplers and failed to address ‘‘continuity of supply’’ issues that it had repeatedly raised.

Miller’s lawyers quickly went through millions of pounds. To make it through the discovery phase of the suit would require millions more. Keith and his two siblings, who own the com­pany together, mortgaged their houses and signed personal guarantees on the company’s debt. But still they didn’t have enough money to see their case through to court. So a contact in London introduced them to Reed Oslan, a Chicago lawyer who specializes in litigation finance.

In the legal world, the Miller lawsuit is what is known as a ‘‘David and Goliath’’ case, in which a plaintiff is so outgunned financially that it wouldn’t be able to have its day in court without a lawyer willing to work on contingency or an infusion of investor cash. The Davids come in a variety of guises. Patricia Cohen, ex-wife of the billionaire hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen, got a reported $1.2 million war chest from a firm called Balance Point, which specializes in funding divorce cases like hers. In 2006, 16 years after their divorce, Patricia saw a ‘‘60 Minutes’’ report on her ex-husband’s business, which led her to file a lawsuit accusing Cohen of racketeering and fraud, claiming that he concealed $5.5 million during their legal proceedings. In 2014, after a string of findings and appeals, a federal judge dismissed the racketeering portion of Patricia’s claim, noting that the only difference between it and other family disputes was ‘‘the seemingly inexhaustible resources that each side has brought to bear,’’ but he allowed Patricia to continue her case against Steven for fraud and other claims. The litigious aftermath of the Cohen divorce, he noted, had persisted for twice as long as the Cohen marriage. Gerald Lefcourt, Patricia Cohen’s lawyer, said that outside financing was necessary for Patricia to challenge someone with the resources of her ex-husband. ‘‘The average person who has a good job making $100,000 a year is middle class, but totally shut out of the legal system,’’ he said. ‘‘You can’t fight a big case. How do you do it?’’

Terms of the deal between Miller UK and its funders have not been disclosed, but funders typically acquire the rights to 20 to 60 percent of all damages in hopes of recouping two or three times their original investment, sometimes more. This month, when Miller UK Ltd. v. Caterpillar Inc. is scheduled to reach trial in a federal court in Chicago, Miller’s lawyers will ask a jury to award Miller more than $100 million. ‘‘As the boss, I have to find a way forward,’’ Keith Miller said. ‘‘We’re just a little business from the northeast of England. Without litigation finance, we couldn’t take them on.’’

Despite the hypercapitalist spirit of its rise, litigation finance actually has its roots in antiquity. According to Max Radin, a historian of ancient city-states, members of Athenian political clubs would back each other in lawsuits against their rivals. Apollodorus, a wealthy banker’s son, bought shares of lawsuits and hired professional orators — some of the earliest lawyers in Western history — to write his court speeches. The Romans tolerated the practice in some cases until the sixth century, when it was banned by Emperor Anastasius. The Roman taboo on litigation finance, Radin writes, sprang from the idea that ‘‘a controversy properly concerned only the persons actually involved in the original transaction,’’ not self-interested meddlers. In medieval England, litigants could hire ‘‘champions’’ to represent them in ‘‘trial by battle.’’ By the late 13th century, these strongmen were being compared to prostitutes, and their prevalence hastened the movement of dispute resolution to the courtroom. During the Middle Ages, this concept of ‘‘champerty’’ — assisting another person’s lawsuit in exchange for a share of the proceeds — emerged as part of the larger ecclesiastical taboo against usury. Though the word was associated with feudal land grabs, Radin notes that in practice, champerty was used by rich lawyers ‘‘on behalf of propertied defendants.’’ In 1787, Jeremy Bentham, the political philosopher, mocked prohibitions on champerty as a holdover from feudal days, where courts were beholden to ‘‘the sword of a baron, stalking into court with a rabble of retainers at his heels.’’

Nevertheless, a vestigial squeamishness about investing in lawsuits made its way across the Atlantic. The first such disputes, early in the 20th century, were over contingency fees, the practice, now common, of lawyers taking on a case in exchange for a percentage of future damages. Unlike England, which still caps fees for winning solicitors, America was open to this kind of payment structure, in keeping with its frontier ethic toward credit and speculation. Twenty-eight states now explicitly permit champerty, as long as funders do not act out of malice, back frivolous lawsuits or exert too much control over trial strategy.

Hedge funds, banks and insurance companies have long been quietly funding the occasional lawsuit, but no major United States investment outfit in the commercial arena specialized in the practice until Juridica was founded in 2007. The industry’s early growth was driven in part by the recession, which made lawyers at big companies eager to hand off risk and also increased the demand among investors for opportunities that could pay off no matter what was happening in the world’s markets. Today the industry seems to have become a permanent part of the financial landscape, with shares of prominent funders trading every day on stock exchanges in London and Sydney.

Anthony Sebok, a professor at Cardozo Law who advises Burford, says he sees the practice as part of a broader trend toward the financialization of the law. ‘‘Why can’t I promise a stranger some piece of the game?’’ he asked me, paraphrasing Bentham’s writings. ‘‘Is there something icky about it, like I’m commodifying my rights? Bentham says these legal rights are our property. Why shouldn’t we be able to sell them?’’ Jonathan Molot, a professor at Georgetown Law who serves as Burford’s chief investment officer, has written that stock offerings by law firms could improve morale, lower rates and help lawyers focus on maximizing long-term profits. Like lawsuits, the firm itself should evolve into an asset. ‘‘It’s a mistake for lawyers to hunker down and say we’re different, we’re excluded, we’re not part of the economy,’’ he said.

But the interests of financiers and plaintiffs are not always so well aligned. Depending on the structure of the deal and the ultimate payout, plaintiffs sometimes walk away with a few crumbs after the funders and lawyers take their share. One such outcome happened in 2007, when Altitude Capital, a funder, invested $8 million in an intellectual-property suit filed by DeepNines, a small network security company, against McAfee, a much larger competitor. The case was settled for $25 million, but after expenses ($2.1 million), lawyers’ fees (roughly $11 million) and Altitude’s cut ($10 million), DeepNines took home $800,000, a little over 3 percent of its settlement. Then, Altitude questioned DeepNines’ math, arguing that the company shouldn’t have deducted its own expenses before calculating contingency fees. It sued its former partner for $5 million more, eventually dropping the suit in 2011.

This kind of falling out is unusual, but it shows the fundamental conflict that can occur. When it’s time to divvy up the prizes, allies can turn into competitors, and smaller, inexperienced plaintiffs can find themselves facing down a second Goliath — their former champion.

The Institute for Legal Reform, a Washington-based lobby affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce, argues that litigation finance will prompt courts to award damages so large that they hurt American businesses. Executives from Johnson & Johnson, FedEx, Dow Chemical and many other large companies have sat on its board. ‘‘We support the position taken by the Institute for Legal Reform,’’ said a spokeswoman for Caterpillar, who said she could not comment further on the Miller case because of the pending lawsuit.

Lisa Rickard, the institute’s president, calls litigation finance ‘‘the biggest single threat to the integrity of our justice system.’’ As evidence, she put me in touch with Howard Schrader, a lawyer for Ace Limited, a $35 billion insurance company engaged in a multifront legal battle over a grievance dating back to the Liberian Civil War of 1991. At its root was the question of whether a Liberian company run by Lebanese nationals was due an insurance settlement over a looted supermarket, or whether the damage fell under a war-risk exclusion in its insurance policy that ruled out ‘‘insurrection.’’ The plaintiff was a Liberian official, represented by a lawyer from the British Virgin Islands, who had found outside investors and sued in a Cayman Islands court to enforce a Liberian judgment. Schrader spent more than an hour speaking with me by phone, dutifully walking me through the case and peeling back mind-numbing layers of acquisitions, indemnity agreements, receiverships and jurisdictional disputes. To Rickard, the Ace Limited case was an example of buccaneering funders tracking down far-flung plaintiffs to pick at old wounds. I wasn’t so sure. On one hand, a giant Swiss insurance company felt it was being shaken down. On the other, a small business felt it was due something for paying years of premiums. I had trouble feeling too sorry for either.

In another long-running legal battle, which began in Ecuador and has since spread to several other jurisdictions, Steven Donziger, a Harvard Law School-educated lawyer, has pursued Chevron with an Ahab-like single-mindedness. He has donned the hats of advocate, adviser and ad hoc fund-raiser for some 30,000 indigenous Ecuadorians who live around the Lago Agrio area and claim that Texaco, which Chevron acquired, left contaminated waste pits around old oil-drilling sites on their land. In 2010, after the case had gone on for 19 years and Donziger’s team had gone through $7 million, Burford bought in. They invested $4 million, with another $11 million planned. In exchange for its support, Burford would receive 5.5 percent of the settlement, which could work out to a 100-to-1 jackpot should Chevron pay $27 billion in damages, an ambitious sum calculated by a court-appointed expert.

Chevron went on offense, digging up outtakes from a documentary in which Donziger extols the suit as an act of ‘‘brute force’’ and the purpose of plaintiffs’ law as ‘‘to make [expletive] money.’’ (Donziger has said that these excerpts are ‘‘grossly misleading or lacking in context.’’)

In September 2011, Burford sent Donziger a letter ending their relationship. They accused his team of ‘‘fraudulent conduct’’ and ‘‘deception,’’ citing Donziger’s communications with the supposedly impartial expert who had come up with the $27 billion settlement figure. Burford said that consultants working with Donziger’s team had ‘‘ghost written’’ the expert’s report and ‘‘worked very hard to cover that up.’’ Donziger, meanwhile, has continued his crusade against Chevron in Canada, Argentina and Brazil. ‘‘You cannot sustain this kind of case without money, and a lot of money,’’ Donziger said in 2010. You can imagine Chevron’s being more inclined to settle had Donziger taken a less ambitious approach. Considering that scenario, it’s arguable that Burford’s investment could have been part of what has kept those 30,000 Ecuadorians — Donziger’s clients — from receiving one penny in damages, more than 20 years after Texaco left their area. In 2014, a federal judge ruled that Donziger could not continue to pursue Chevron in the United States. Donziger has appealed and continues his foreign lawsuits. Chevron calls the case against the company ‘‘the legal fraud of the century.’’

Not long ago I had breakfast with Christopher Bogart, Burford’s C.E.O. He is in early middle age, and his well-tended appearance and subtly asymmetric eyeglasses signal prosperity. ‘‘We’ve done more than 100 deals,’’ he said, speaking of the Chevron case. ‘‘We haven’t had another one that’s gone that way.’’ Burford, Bogart told me, never anticipated a $27 billion payout. ‘‘We believed that Chevron would settle for much less than that,’’ he said, perhaps $1 billion, a more modest 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 win.

‘‘The case illustrates something that I think all lawyers know,’’ he continued. ‘‘You don’t always get all of the facts from your client.’’ His tone was somewhere between resignation and remorse, like a banker who had made a bad bet.

Of course, the transformation of legal disputes into deals didn’t begin with litigation finance. For years, observers of the legal profession have criticized how the market economy erodes its ethical obligations, pushing private advantage over public good and billable hours above all. Only the truly rich can afford to hire a professional who will zealously and exhaustively defend their interests. When litigation financiers talk about expanding access to justice and standing up for the little guy, they generally mean helping millionaires pursue claims against billionaires. In some ways, the rise of litigation finance is a symptom of what the American civil-justice system has become — a slow, expensive and complicated system for mediating corporate breakups. The judges in this system might talk like referees, but their function is moving toward that of accountants.

Keith Miller sometimes imagines his lawsuit as a movie, the heavy-equipment version of ‘‘Erin Brockovich.’’ For years, he claims, Caterpillar denied rumors that it was building its own version of the Bug, reassuring Miller of the prospects for their ongoing relationship up to the moment that Cat terminated the contract. Emails turned up during discovery by Miller’s legal team show Caterpillar employees’ strategizing about what to do if the information somehow leaked. To Keith Miller, the dispute over the quick coupler’s origin is about more than money.

‘‘All we want to do is set the record straight about what happened and why,’’ he told me.

An initial skirmish in Miller v. Caterpillar involved a major question for litigation finance as a whole — should plaintiffs be forced to disclose their funding arrangements, or are they entitled to keep these deals confidential? Lisa Rickard, from the Institute for Legal Reform, argues in favor of disclosure. ‘‘That helps the judge and the defendant understand who’s pulling the strings,’’ she told me.

Judge Jeffrey Cole, who is presiding over the Miller case, disagreed. He called champerty ‘‘a hoary doctrine’’ that time had ‘‘narrowed to a filament.’’ Many of the particulars of Miller’s financial dealings with its backers, Cole found, are irrelevant, as they ‘‘have nothing to do with the claims or defenses in the case.’’ Miller could keep the specifics of how it was financing its lawsuit confidential.

If Cole’s ruling is any indication, the day is approaching when lawsuits are something like the Bug itself — complicated, expensive and eminently transferable commodities. More and more lawyers will find themselves being paid by people whose interest in the outcome is speculative, not personal. Somewhat like mortgage banking, lawyering will involve serving as a buffer between the people who care and the people who manage the probabilities.

Like most entrepreneurs, Keith Miller is a bit of both. His feelings about Caterpillar’s treatment of the Bug haven’t stopped him from continuing to sell the company some of Miller’s smaller products. ‘‘We’re hand-to-mouth each month,’’ he says. ‘‘Quite frankly, we’re not in a position to turn anything down.’’ Could he ever imagine repairing Miller’s relationship with Cat? ‘‘I’d be delighted to do that,’’ he said. ‘‘So long as we’re reimbursed for our losses.’’",REAL
The Soft Evidence Behind the Hard Rhetoric of ‘Deterrence’,"Photo

In the small city of Rome, Ga., in 1986, a retired schoolteacher named Queen Madge White was strangled to death by a young man who broke into her home. After his girlfriend turned him in to the police, Timothy Foster confessed to the crime. Foster lived in a housing project a few blocks from his victim. He was 18 and black. She was 79 and white. Choosing the jury that would decide whether Foster deserved to be executed, the prosecutors sent home four potential black jurors. They gave reasons that they said were unrelated to race, as the Supreme Court requires, but that seem unconvincing. The prosecutors said they struck one black woman from the jury because, at 34, she was too close to Foster’s age. They said they excluded a black man because his wife worked at a hospital. But so did a white woman who was asked to sit on the jury, which, in the end, was entirely white.

In early November, the Supreme Court will hear Foster’s appeal, to address whether he should have a new trial because racial bias infected the selection of jurors — and ultimately their decision to vote for execution. Since then, the prosecutors’ notes for jury selection have come to light. The names of the black prospective jurors were marked with a B and highlighted in green. ‘‘If it comes down to having to pick one of the black jurors, Ms. Garrett might be O.K.,’’ an investigator for the prosecution wrote of the 34-year-old woman. Foster’s new lawyers say the prosecution wanted an all-white jury that would respond to its closing plea: to sentence him to death ‘‘to deter other people out there in the projects,’’ where 90 percent of the residents were black.

The prosecution’s use of ‘‘deter’’ before the jury was deliberate. Americans were familiar with the Cold War meaning of the word: to contain Soviet aggression. The prosecution invoked it to make an argument for containing crime, which was then on the rise in White’s neighborhood and across the country. As politicians competed to show their determination to protect the public, ‘‘deterrence’’ was positioned as the respectable rationale for cracking down on criminals. Proponents used the dry, dispassionate terms of economics to describe robbers, drug dealers and murderers as ‘‘perfectly rational men and women’’ responding to lenient sentencing that made the cost of committing crimes ‘‘shamelessly cheap,’’ as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas wrote in a Times Op-Ed article in 1993. Gramm, a Republican, used the language of deterrence to crusade for mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders: ‘‘When a potential criminal knows that if he is convicted he is certain to be sentenced, and his sentence is certain to be stiff, his cost-benefit calculus changes dramatically.’’

Today, the conversation about deterrence has become far more contested, because of the social and fiscal costs of mass incarceration. In October, the Justice Department announced it would free 6,000 nonviolent drug offenders who were behind bars, often because of the mandatory minimum sentences that Congress was eager to pass in Gramm’s day. Freeing prisoners has for decades been seen as politically perilous, but now there is increasing bipartisan agreement that lengthy sentences are used too fre­quently. Perhaps the country has hit a limit for ratcheting up punishment in the name of deterrence.

As it turns out, deterrence was not originally intended as an argument for harsh punishment. ‘‘Deter’’ comes from the Latin for ‘‘to frighten or discourage from.’’ ‘‘Deterrent’’ first appeared in English in 1829, in a book about punishment by the British philosopher Jeremy Bentham, the father of utilitarianism. He believed that a law’s success could be measured by whether ‘‘the desired effect is produced by the employment of the least possible suffering.” Punishment should be swift, certain and severe enough to achieve deterrence — but not more severe than necessary.

In the United States, the crime rate has fallen significantly since the early 1990s. But according to a 2014 review by the National Research Council, the threat of lengthy sentences has had little impact. Actually locking up more people does account for a modest portion of the drop in crime, the review found. But even ‘‘incapacitation’’ plays only a limited role in explaining the decline in crime of the last two decades. ‘‘If you keep throwing people in prison, you run out of the most dangerous guys, and you start suffering from diminishing marginal returns,’’ says Franklin Zimring, director of the criminal-justice-studies program at the University of California, Berkeley.",REAL
You’re Not Supposed to Understand the Federal Reserve,"Photo

Imagine if aliens in a spacecraft were studying the United States from above. Their conclusion, I expect, would be that the single most important decision these inscrutable humans make each year is whether to plant corn, soybeans or wheat. No decision, year after year, transforms more square miles of American land than the choice farmers make about which crops to grow. In some years, those aliens would see huge swaths of tight green rows of soybean; in others, more tall corn with yellow tufts; in others, an unusual abundance of wheat in, well, amber waves. Earlier this month, Rick Stern, who farms 1,500 acres in central New Jersey with his father, told me that he had just spent weeks making this very decision. He carefully studied the global market reports to learn about recent yields in Argentina and Brazil, America’s leading rivals for soybean exports. He grew up watching his father and grandfather face the same dilemma each fall, using as much information as they could scrape together.

But this year, there’s another variable that everyone is talking about — a factor that Stern doesn’t quite understand but knows will have a huge impact on the commercial grain business: whether, or when, the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Stern knows that the Federal Reserve is a powerful group of people who make decisions in Washington, but he doesn’t know exactly how it works. ‘‘That’s something I’ll never be privy to,’’ he told me, standing in a field of soybeans, in front of his enormous combine (‘‘It’s like a rocket ship with wheels,’’ said my son, amazed). ‘‘I just know their decision affects everybody.’’

Here’s what Stern does know: If the Fed raises rates, it would be bad for farmers like him. It would strengthen the dollar against the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, which in turn would mean that importers in China, Vietnam and the Middle East would buy more from South America and less from him. He also knows a rate increase would make it more expensive to borrow money to upgrade his equipment. He points out that his combine is 10 years old: If it broke down and he had to replace it, higher interest rates would make that enormous purchase significantly more costly to finance.

Over all, Stern has learned, a Fed rate increase — and there will possibly be one before the end of the year — will mean more acres of corn and fewer of soybeans, because American farmers won’t be able to rely as much on export markets to sell corn. It also means Stern will pay more attention to the few acres he has set aside for specialty crops, like watermelon, cantaloupe, tomatoes and hay. These he grows for local sale, so a stronger dollar won’t affect them. He just wishes the Fed would leave rates alone, and he can’t understand why they would even consider raising them. ‘‘It’s politics,’’ he says. ‘‘Most politicians forget who they are and why they went to Washington.’’

Senator Nelson Aldrich, who spearheaded the creation of the Fed in 1908, would probably have been thrilled — he might have audibly chuckled — to hear that Americans today have no idea how to influence the Fed’s decisions. Rick Stern sees the Fed as just another group of politicians, but in fact the Fed was exquisitely, painstakingly designed to resist the influence of politicians as much as possible, so as to avoid corruption by the lobbying that politicians constantly receive.

It’s almost as if the Fed were designed to confound explanation of it, precisely so the Rick Sterns of the world could never hope to influence it. Aristotle, in his ‘‘Poetics,’’ described a formula for emotionally engaging drama that screenwriters still consult to this day, with central characters and a plot that moves from a beginning through a climax to resolution. Presidential elections can be molded into this Aristotelian structure perfectly, as can many major news stories. The Fed, by contrast, seems more like somebody sat down with a copy of ‘‘Poetics’’ and carefully constructed its opposite. There is no beginning to Fed action; it’s always there, always acting, even when its action is to not make any changes. There is no natural climax. It’s just an ongoing conference between a group of economists. And it is never resolved. There is no single moment when the Fed is done.",REAL
Should I Set the Record Straight About a Suicide?,"My mother and I were very close. I moved her to a facility near me that could provide her with some support (meals, housecleaning) so that she could live with less stress because of a serious, irreparable heart condition. Years later she took me into her confidence, saying she could no longer tolerate the loss of focus, loss of memory, inability to think creatively and extreme fatigue her condition burdened her with. She felt it was better to die than to go on so impaired and had amassed enough pills to go peacefully in her sleep. I routinely called her every morning to wake her and to make sure she was still alive. She requested this because she said she did not want her body to lie in decay for days after her death. I regularly argued for the value of her life with her and was hopeful that she was just seeking solace. She wasn’t. She put herself into a coma and passed away a few days later.

My ethics question has to do with the knowledge of her death. She has a grandson and a step-granddaughter who would be crushed to discover she had taken her own life. My nephew worshiped her and is very fragile emotionally.

I know that suicide has a deep impact on families and can trigger copycat behavior years later. I do not want to put my family at risk, nor do I wish to destroy their memory of her. But the burden of this knowledge weighs heavily on me, and I feel a deep sadness and sense of guilt that I could not keep her from ending her own life prematurely. Name Withheld

I admire the way you handled the situation while your mother was alive, respecting her right to take this decision but continuing to make the case for her not doing so. It’s understandable that you’re saddened by your failure to persuade her; feeling guilty, though, is justified only if you did something wrong, and, given that she was mentally competent, there’s no reason to think you did. Now you face a further question about respecting her decisions. If you’re sure she didn’t want you to tell the rest of the family what really happened, this should weigh strongly with you. So should the fact that your family would be disturbed by the truth.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Yet there are considerations on the other sides of both these issues. Your mother may have spoken to you in confidence because she feared the family would interfere if you told them while she was alive. That may have given her some basis for denying them the information then. Still, the truth about how she died is an important truth about her life, and your family would be entitled to be upset if they discovered you had kept it from them now. Weighing these issues alone, I’d say you should figure out a way to tell them.

But you also raise worries about the effects of telling them. The literature on the impact of suicide is complicated, and it’s hard to find studies that address what the likely effects of discovering what happened might be. I’ve seen one study suggesting that euthanasia — when the death is chosen as a response to suffering — is less traumatic for the family than death from natural causes. Yet this may have to do with the fact that, with euthanasia, the family often has a chance to say goodbye. In your case, that didn’t happen.

Life isn’t just about happy and unhappy experiences, though. It’s also about facing up to and accepting the truth. I don’t know enough about your nephew’s mental condition to suggest what you might safely tell him. For the others, I’ll venture that the value of understanding what really happened outweighs the immediate pain this knowledge will bring. The decision you and your mother made to keep them out of the loop earlier may itself put a strain on family relations for a while. Still, while we’re thinking about consequences, consider this: Someday, other members of your family may face a situation like the one you faced with your mother. Maybe, with this knowledge, they’ll handle it as well as you did.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Bamba,"Photo

My son’s first word was ‘‘Mama.’’ His second was ‘‘Bamba.’’ It is among his favorite things, right up there with picture books, his blanket and the washing machine. The product was born nearly five decades before he was, when its manufacturer, Osem, swapped out the cheese it had been dusting on its corn puffs for peanut butter, a more kosher-friendly alternative. Quickly it became Israel’s national snack; now everyone eats Bamba there, from 9-month-olds — like my son — to 90-year-olds. Osem churns out one million bags a day in a country of eight million people. That’s what I hear, at least. I’ve never been. I first learned of Bamba through a study published in February in The New England Journal of Medicine.

One night last summer, around 3 a.m., I was reading on my iPhone while nursing, and I came across a study led by a pediatric allergy specialist named Gideon Lack. He had noticed that Israeli Jews were much less likely to be plagued by peanut allergies than their British counterparts, and he sought an environmental explanation. It didn’t take long for him to land at the high chair. Lack and his colleagues designed a longitudinal study, feeding small amounts of Bamba to babies at high risk for developing an allergy (and none to a control group) from the time they began eating finger foods until they turned 5, ulti­mately finding that the snack reduced their risk by 81 percent.

Upon reading this, I proceeded to do what any literal-minded new parent might do in the middle of the night: I opened the Amazon app and ordered Bamba in bulk. On an academic level, I understood that mixing peanut butter into my son’s applesauce would probably provide the same protective benefit — it’s not as if he’d know the difference — but on an emotional level, I wasn’t ready to give up the idea that a panacea for peanut allergies would arrive on my doorstep in two to three business days.

There are so many things to be concerned about as a new parent, but nothing induces quite the same brand of panic as peanuts. They’re the worst sort of villain — variably innocuous or deadly for wholly mysterious reasons. Today, about one in 50 American kids is allergic to them. What I couldn’t escape in the peanut study was the uncomfortable truth lurking beneath it: that well-intended parents might have caused, and have certainly worsened, the peanut menace. (Until as recently as 2008, parents were advised to avoid feeding peanuts to at-risk kids until age 3.) In doing everything they could to protect their children, they instead made their children more vulnerable.

The Hateful Eight: According to the F.D.A., more than 160 foods cause allergies, but the following eight account for 90 percent of all adverse reactions: Milk Eggs Fish Crustacean shellfish Tree nuts Peanuts Wheat Soybeans

It’s a dissonance that’s tough to square. Nothing is more unnerving than exposing your child to danger for his benefit, be it germs, shots, strangers, allergens or gravity. You have to steel your nerves, even when he looks at you with an expression of utter betrayal. What’s great about Bamba is that you get to skip all that; it’s an inocu­lation housed in a guilty pleasure.

When my 2.3-pound box of Bamba arrived, I opened a one-ounce packet, handed a puff to my toothless son and watched as he, exhibiting a level of hand-eye coordination theretofore unseen, ate it in thoughtful deliberation. Nothing happened. The next day, I gave him two puffs. Still nothing. The following day, we polished off the remainder of the bag. Today, whether we’re in the library or on an airplane, in a play group or at a picnic, if my son hears the crinkle of a Bamba bag, he will wave his little hands excitedly and dive for it.",REAL

Jerk Was Meant to Be Messed With,"Photo

‘‘Do you like spicy food?’’ Harold Dieterle asked, standing behind a folding table at the Star Island Yacht Club and Marina in Montauk, N.Y. There were small plates of smoked bluefish, heavily daubed in a Jamaican-style jerk sauce, and the question was fair warning to the people standing before him, participants in Redbone, a charity fishing tournament that takes place each year to raise money for research into a cure for cystic fibrosis.

Dieterle, the chef and an owner of two restaurants in Manhattan, is not known for a light hand with the spice jars. His food — vaguely Asian at Perilla, Thai at Kin Shop — can be fiery and immensely detailed: It resembles intricate music that’s played very, very loud. The jerk sauce adorning his bluefish at the buffet dinner that evening was no exception. Its heat towered above the dense smokiness of the fish, but lifted it as well, thanks to the thyme and allspice, the wisps of sweetness beneath the habanero heat. A deep note of caramelized sugar lay below, as well as a scent of rum.

‘‘You could serve it on chicken,’’ Dieterle told me. ‘‘It’s insane on ribs.’’ You could serve it on blocks of tofu, on squash, on tendrils of squid, on planks of fluke. And it seemed suddenly necessary to do so right away, to deliver the scents and flavors of endless summer heat throughout the predations of a Northeastern autumn and deep into winter.

Jerk sauce, a wet marinade that adorns chicken, pork and fish across Jamaica and the West Indies, has its roots in the cooking of the African diaspora in the Caribbean. In Jamaica, its excellence often derives from the interplay of the chiles, thyme and allspice with the source of the smoke over which the meat is cooked: pimentón, from the branches of the allspice tree.

Dieterle’s recipe, though, owes little to any of that. Instead, it comes from New York City. He developed it, he said, after eating the jerk cooking of his friend Jeff Allen — who himself had found inspiration in a recipe for Cornish game hens that the chef Brad Thompson contributed to Food & Wine in 2008. (That recipe, in turn, was a variation of one Thompson had learned from his Jamaican-born wife, Kerry-Ann Evans-Thompson. Excellence has many parents.)

When I got in touch with Allen, verbs like ‘‘doctored’’ and ‘‘experimented’’ studded his language. He had many spices on hand from the Market Spice Shop in Seattle — ancho, chipotle, habanero, red savanna — and he used them in his jerk. ‘‘A purist would cringe,’’ he said, ‘‘and there is no way you can call out the individual flavors of these chile powders, but I have convinced myself that they make a difference.’’",REAL
Judge John Hodgman on Bad Faith,"Photo

Tobias writes: My wife is Jewish by heritage; by rabbinical law, the children we plan to have will be Jewish as well. I would like them to go to Hebrew school. They would study a language and learn about their heritage and the Old Testament. My wife disagrees, because we are evangelical Christians. She thinks it would contradict our faith.

I think all religions should be afforded respect, which includes not treating your town’s Hebrew school like a Learning Annex course on the Talmud. It’s almost literal bad faith. That said, I guess you could ask the school if they were O.K. with your kids just ... auditing Judaism for a while. Who knows? Maybe your kids will have their own conversion experience, as you once did, and be born again in non-Jesus. It’s part of their family tradition, after all.",REAL
How to Catch a Baseball in the Stands,"Photo

‘‘Wear a glove,’’ says Zack Hample, who caught his first major-league ball as a 12-year-old at Shea Stadium in 1990 and has since collected 8,616 balls at 51 ballparks. Think of yourself as a way-out-there outfielder. Sometimes, Hample is on his feet the whole game, scampering back and forth in the bleachers from left field to right. Don’t stay in your ticketed seat unless you have to. Seek out designated standing areas or move to an aisle seat in a sparsely populated row. ‘‘Lateral mobility is key,’’ Hample says. In the off-season, he writes books about baseball and works at Argosy, his family’s Manhattan bookstore. During the season, he traverses the country as a so-called ball hawk, snagging balls that he stores in giant plastic barrels in his mother’s basement. (Highlights have included Alex Rodriguez’s 3,000th-career-hit ball and the first major-league home run hit by Mike Trout, the reigning American League M.V.P.)

Before the game, study the lineup, note the dominant hands of the starting batters and pitchers (‘‘the righty-lefty matchups,’’ in Hample’s words) and position yourself in the ballpark accord­ingly. Right-handed batters tend to hit foul balls to the right side of home plate and home runs over left field. The opposite is true of left-handed hitters.

The easiest balls come at batting practice before the game, when players hit more home runs and often toss balls into the stands while warming up. ‘‘They prefer to throw to little kids and attractive women,’’ Hample says. If neither describes you, increase your odds by dressing like a superfan. Hample carries a backpack containing paraphernalia for both teams and changes his hat and T-shirt to match those of whatever team is on the field.

Once you’re tracking a ball in flight, prepare to dive on the ground and ward off the flying elbows, shoves, scratches, ball snatching and name-calling. That ball in your grasp momentarily transforms you: You’re on the Jumbotron, players turn to look at you, tens of thousands of fellow spectators want what you have. ‘‘In your hand is the object at the center of the game,’’ Hample says. ‘‘You own it, and that’s tremendously exhilarating.’’",REAL
‘Halfway Down’,"Halfway down: the sight of a doe through the trees in the meadow. I stopped to stare at her staring at me. The silence arced between us like a wire in a current that equaled strangeness over time, and since her stare was wild — so charged with fear the moment froze on the line of sky and field, man and deer — she broke our stillness in her flight from me. I stood alone but double then as the man on the path and the memory of the man she carried with her beyond the meadow into the next meadow and the meadow after that where she returned my image to the field of her forgetting in which I roamed like a deer myself, remembering.",REAL

RE: NICKI MINAJ

Vanessa Grigoriadis profiled Nicki Minaj, the world’s biggest female rap superstar, who exercises her power by selling records, filling arenas and ending interviews once she deems a question disrespectful.

The story’s first sentence establishes that Minaj shall be evaluated for the next few thousand words as part of the archetype of ‘‘the female star — Beyoncé, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and, as always, Madonna.’’ ... This is a traditional way of thinking about female performers: mainly in the context of other female performers. Swift, Perry, Minaj et al. are, supposedly, calculated climbers who smile together for the cameras but secretly hunger to be the uncontested Queen of Pop. The warring-women stereotype has also often been called out as limiting and sexist, but it’s undeniable that stars themselves often play into it. ... (This phenomenon, of course, is just a result of human self-expression and competitive drive — not limited to women, or even to famous people.)

One of the many things that make Nicki Minaj fascinating is how she defies this paradigm. When she ‘‘throws shade’’ — at males or females or, more often, at culture more broadly — it’s not through innuendo in the style of Taylor Swift’s ‘‘Bad Blood’’ (maybe about Katy Perry). It’s through bracing and hilarious call-outs. ... This bluntness is not, as some people would suggest, artless or unthinking. It’s a trait of an art form that at its best is pointed and hyperreal and very memorable — hip-hop, not pop. Spencer Kornhaber, in a post for The Atlantic

Photo

For Grigoriadis, the pop-music scene is like a ‘‘national telenovela,’’ and she begins her feature rightfully likening Nicki Minaj’s recent clashes with Taylor Swift and Miley Cyrus ... to a ‘‘three-act revenge drama.’’ It’s a fair comparison, and of course there is a performative nature to any public dispute. It’s easy to simply dismiss it all as mere fodder for the drama-ravenous public, unless, of course, you’re a journalist, and your job is to work within the highs and lows of pop culture — to, for example, uncover the real issues of cultural appropriation being highlighted by a celebrity feud.

And Grigoriadis does this, to some degree. She lets Nicki Minaj address the ongoing issue with Cyrus, which re­sulted in the most quoted part of the interview so far: ‘‘... If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, bond with us, dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us. You shouldn’t not want to know that.’’ ... Minaj’s words go in one ear and out the other. Everything about the rest of the article proves that Grigoriadis has shown up, not to learn about or learn from the black woman at the center of piece, but to enjoy the fruits of this woman’s labor and cast judgment, even as she participates. Shannon M. Houston, in a post for Salon.com

Some have already questioned Nicki Minaj’s dismissal of Grigoriadis and calling back attention to Cyrus’s assessment that Minaj is ‘‘not too kind.’’ I loathe this juvenile retort. Kindness is wonderful, but what you receive from another is often a direct result of what you throw out there first. Nicki Minaj does not get the respect she deserves inside and outside of hip-hop. Why would you expect her to walk around with a big smile on her face among those speaking down to her? ... Her temperament shouldn’t change until her treatment does. Michael Arceneaux, in a post for VH1.com

RE: IDENTITY

Wesley Morris wrote about the breakdown this year of our strictly held identities in pop culture.

Photo

We’ve begun to realize on a culturewide basis that many of the descriptors we’ve used to define ourselves are entirely arbitrary. ... But at the same time, those descriptors retain their power to oppress. And if the identity that others assign you retains its oppressive power, then this loss of identity can feel more disempowering than anything else. What’s the benefit of everyone else’s being able to be more fluid about their sexuality if you still get beaten up in real life in your small town for being gay? Where’s the liberation in the deconstruction of race if you still can’t hail a cab?

Online, you’re another I.P. address; offline, you’re still trapped in your identity — or, more accurately, the part of your identity that others perceive. The result is the curious dichotomy that Morris discusses: ‘‘the way your online profile can diverge from your real-life identity, yes, but also the way you can choose a self or a self can choose you.’’ It’s telling that the way we choose a self online these days seems to rely more and more on a repudiation of the homogenizing power of the Internet.

A Slacker of Jakarta,"Seeing her son failing to fulfill his faithful obligation to God, my mother did not hesitate to wake me. I am almost 40, but in her eyes I am like an 8-year-old. ‘‘Look at the time! Get up, child, you have almost missed subh prayers!’’

With anybody else, I would have gotten angry. But I couldn’t do that with my mother. Instead, with my eyes still half closed and my head feeling heavy, I gave her a big smile and staggered off to the bathroom to do my morning ablutions. My mother sat herself down in my work chair, feeding the baby and making sure that I said my prayers. Like a guardian angel.

So be it. My father was an imam, responsible for giving a sermon at the mosque every Friday, and after he died, my mother became a sort of protector of our family’s faith. She reminded her six children not only to pray but also to pay zakat (tithes), fast during Ramadan and buy a goat or a cow to sacrifice on Eid al-Adha.

In general I was happy that she lived closer to us, and my 5-year-old daughter was delighted. If there was no food left in the house, I could go to my mother and in a boyish voice ask her to cook me some fried rice. If I felt as if I was coming down with a slight fever, I could even lie down in her lap, and she would gently stroke my hair. But her presence did disrupt my secular lifestyle, and it wasn’t just the business about praying five times a day.

One morning very soon after she arrived, I was on my way to work when I was stricken with a desperate panic. It was actually a trivial problem: There were some six-packs of beer and two bottles of wine in our fridge. But I knew that if my mother discovered them, I would be finished! Muslims are not supposed to drink alcohol of any kind. My mother most likely wouldn’t get angry or make a scene; she wasn’t that kind of person, but she would certainly be sad — at the very least thinking that I had become a drunk, if not that I had completely lost my faith — and the idea of seeing her sad terrified me more than seeing her angry.

Luckily, I fixed the problem before she had the chance to open our fridge. I didn’t want to drink all my alcohol in one night, but I also didn’t want to throw it away, so what I did was take the labels off the wine bottles. If she asked about them, I could say that they were some special Korean sauces, or make up something else that she wouldn’t know anything about. For the beer, I found a safe hiding place: the trunk of my car. For days I drove those six-packs around with me wherever I went, forced to drink warm beer in the hot Jakarta weather, until I had an even smarter idea: I moved them to my office refrigerator.

My efforts to keep up appearances were successful, until one day, when my mother, my daughter and my wife were all together in the front room of my house. All of a sudden, my daughter asked, ‘‘Grandma, is it true that people who don’t pray will go to hell?’’

My mother, with complete certainty, of course replied, “Yes.”

Then my daughter continued, ‘‘Well, I’ve never seen Daddy pray.’’

The room fell silent. I wanted to laugh at the absurdity of the situation, but I didn’t have the nerve to do so in front of my mother, who had turned to me with a look that demanded an explanation. Instead, I felt my face turn pale.",REAL
Shrimp Boy’s Day in Court,"But at dawn on March 26, 2014, while Shrimp Boy, Lo and her daughter were asleep in her home, law-enforcement officers broke down the front door, semiautomatic weapons drawn. ‘‘That didn’t scare me,’’ Shrimp Boy said. ‘‘What really scared me was worrying about Alicia and her daughter and the two dogs. They never had that kind of thing around.’’ To minimize the havoc — it was a school day — Shrimp Boy cooperated, and as he lay on the living-room floor in handcuffs, with more than a dozen people standing above him, he thought back through his recent activities. ‘‘I didn’t sell no drugs,’’ he recalled thinking. ‘‘I didn’t have no gun. I didn’t have no money.’’ Then, he said: ‘‘I kind of laughed. What I did is O.K.! I’m a changed man!’’

On Nov. 2, in Judge Charles Breyer’s courtroom at the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, Shrimp Boy, who is 55, is scheduled to stand trial on 140 counts, including racketeering, money laundering, conspiracy and trafficking in contraband cigarettes. Between 2008 and 2014, the F.B.I. ran a sting called Operation Whitesuit. Confidential informants infiltrated San Francisco’s Chinatown and presented Shrimp Boy, who the government claims was back in the gang business, with opportunities to participate in crimes, including drug trafficking and murder for hire. Shrimp Boy claims he abstained.

Shrimp Boy and his lead lawyer, J. Tony Serra, are both characters from a bygone San Francisco. Shrimp Boy describes Serra, who is 80, as ‘‘an old, very old wizard.’’ Earlier in his career, in 1979, Serra successfully defended the Black Panther Party co-founder Huey Newton against the charge of murdering a prostitute. He has also represented members of the Hells Angels, Earth First! and the Symbionese Liberation Army, the revolutionary group that kidnapped Patty Hearst. His office is filled with threadbare furniture and Grateful Dead posters, as well as posters featuring the work of his younger brother, the sculptor Richard Serra. They have been estranged for almost 40 years, since their mother committed suicide by walking into the Pacific Ocean.

‘‘I’m just so happy I’m not dead,’’ Serra, who has thinning white hair and less than a full set of teeth, told me on a recent Sunday morning at his office. He wore a tie-dye T-shirt that looked new. Within 10 minutes of my arrival, Serra described Shrimp Boy to me as ‘‘beautiful.’’ When I asked what he meant, he said: ‘‘Every time I go to talk to Shrimp Boy, it’s like being in the presence of a holy man. He’s soft and gentle and considerate and empathetic.’’ For Serra, representing Shrimp Boy is an honor and a privilege. ‘‘This is the type of case that any politically inclined lawyer — this is your holy grail,’’ he said. ‘‘This is a government-created crime. This is a five-year and probably $3 million investigation.’’ He concluded: ‘‘I’m just delighted to take on the goddamn case.’’

Serra grew up in a working-class family near San Francisco’s Ocean Beach. After playing football as an undergraduate at Stanford, he tried to become an expat writer in Morocco, but at that point he had never smoked a cigarette and was put off by the heroin and the opium. He returned to San Francisco, discovered the Haight and took a vow of poverty. He graduated from law school at U.C. Berkeley in 1961 and has worked almost exclusively pro bono since. Among Serra’s many strong beliefs is that nostalgia is a scourge — ‘‘the first sign of death,’’ he says. Still, it bears noting that one of the biggest cases of his early career also involved Chinatown. Serra exonerated, in a retrial, a Korean-American man convicted of the 1973 murder of a Chinatown gang leader. That case formed the basis of the 1989 movie ‘‘True Believer,’’ with James Woods starring as a character modeled on Serra.

Serra himself has served two prison terms, as a tax resister — four months in 1974 and 10 months in 2005. He would be happy to serve a third, should anyone care to arrest him. He loves life on the inside — ‘‘It’s like locking a doctor who likes to practice medicine in a hospital,’’ he once said. Less felicitous, to Serra, is contemporary, gilded San Francisco. (‘‘Look out the window! Do you see the common man?’’) Serra has no bank account, no credit card and no cellphone. ‘‘My DNA is nonmaterialistic,’’ he explained. He abhors what he perceives as the extravagance of American law enforcement after Sept. 11: As part of the sting, F.B.I. informants ate meals with Shrimp Boy at the Four Seasons, the Fairmont and the Ritz, according to a co-defendant’s filing.

A few weeks after Shrimp Boy’s arrest last March, Serra held a news conference. ‘‘These undercover agents sought to induce him, sought to involve him, sought to catch him in some overt act that represented criminal activity,’’ Serra told the journalists and friends of Shrimp Boy — many of whom were wearing ‘‘Free Shrimp Boy’’ T-shirts. ‘‘My client’s not a gangster.’’ The F.B.I., he said, ‘‘didn’t stop, you know, abort criminal activity that my client participated in.’’ Serra pointed to a picture of Shrimp Boy, who is 5-foot-4, nearly wrinkle-free and almost always smiling. ‘‘You saw a person,’’ Serra continued, ‘‘who is wholly dedicated to the Chinese culture. To love. Education. We represent an exemplary human being.’’ He paused to clarify for those familiar with the Shrimp Boy of the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, a man who was convicted of racketeering, drug trafficking, arson, armed robbery and attempted murder. ‘‘I’m not talking before he went to prison,’’ Serra said. ‘‘I’m talking after he got out.’’

In Shrimp Boy’s pretrial defense, Serra, along with his co-counsel, Curtis Briggs, a former small-time criminal, has employed a legal strategy right out of the Merry Prankster handbook: Stand out, be aggressive and fight authority every step of the way. Serra, Briggs and other members of the team have accused the F.B.I. of racial profiling — setting a dragnet over Chinatown to catch Chinese people breaking the law. They have also demanded that Shrimp Boy’s case be dismissed on the grounds of selective prosecution: They argued in a motion that the same series of wiretaps that led to Shrimp Boy’s indictment also revealed that Mayor Ed Lee of San Francisco laundered campaign money. (The mayor’s office did not return calls and emails but has publicly denied this.) Judge Breyer ruled against the motion, but the local press ran with the story, which was largely the point.

Serra is cynical about many things. He believes that ‘‘law is class struggle.’’ He believes that judges ‘‘are not referees, they are bullies,’’ and that they make decisions ‘‘based on their own moral perspective.’’ But Serra still believes in juries, believes they are ‘‘the last avenue to the common mentality, and there is something beautiful in the American mentality.’’ He sincerely believes that a jury will hear Shrimp Boy’s story and let him go. ‘‘We have a person who did have an epiphany,’’ he said about Shrimp Boy’s decision to go straight and live a normal life, a person who didn’t succumb to the government’s yearslong campaign to lure him back into crime.

The prosecution, on the other hand, argues that Shrimp Boy was employing a classic strategy: ‘‘He did not have to get his hands dirty committing crimes and could insulate himself — although he did it poorly in the end — from the crimes being committed around him,’’ the government wrote in a filing. ‘‘The jury should be permitted to understand that Chow’s techniques were taught to him by his prior dai los.’’ (Dai lo is the Cantonese term for big brother, or mob boss.) Still, Serra is confident. To win this case, and any case, he said, ‘‘You have to show you have the moral high ground — that you have transcended the conflict as defined by the prosecution.’’ He paused, then added: ‘‘I have the Buddha here.’’

The visiting room of San Francisco County Jail No. 4 is on the seventh floor of the Hall of Justice, at 850 Bryant Street, across from Aladdin Bail Bonds and one block from Mint, a yoga, Pilates and barre-class studio. On weekend mornings, families wait in a concrete stairwell between the sixth and seventh floors. Over the past six months, I often joined the line. Each time, after a guard unlocked the door, I found Shrimp Boy among other inmates, sitting on a stool behind soundproof glass, waving me over to take a seat on the other side and pick up the phone. He started each conversation with: ‘‘Hello. How are you?’’ His face was far more relaxed than I expected, and his black plastic-framed glasses hung from the collar of his orange county-jail sweatshirt. He has soft hands and a shiny bald head. From our talks, both in jail and over the phone, and from his unpublished memoir, I learned the story of his life, at least according to Shrimp Boy; there are no public records of many of the details.

Slide Show

Kwok Cheung Chow was born in Hong Kong, where his grandmother nicknamed him Ha Jai, or Shrimp Boy. His father owned a successful barbershop, but when Shrimp Boy was 8, his father lost his business because of gambling debts. Shrimp Boy, his four brothers, his grandmother and his parents all moved from their nice apartment above the barbershop to a one-room shack with no running water. A year later, that shanty burned down, and Shrimp Boy’s family moved to a home with only two beds. Every night, Shrimp Boy fought to sleep next to his grandmother. He liked to hold onto her ear, for comfort, the way a child might cling to a stuffed animal.

When Shrimp Boy was 9, he told me, a local tough noticed his scrappiness and bravado — Shrimp Boy often puffed up his tiny body and told people he had won fights even when he lost. The tough took him on as a protégé, teaching him the ancient Chinese gang code of loyalty, trust, honor, dignity and respect, as well as the value of keeping a knife tucked in the waistband of your pants. Before long, Shrimp Boy says, he was working for his mentor, as a courier transporting small bags of heroin. Shortly after, Shrimp Boy showed up to watch his mentor in a fight. When the brawl started going badly, Shrimp Boy pulled out a huge, squared-off watermelon knife and leapt into the action. He whacked the blade, twice, on his mentor’s opponent’s head. Blood, exposed bone. This was the first significant violence of Shrimp Boy’s life. He became a local gang hero, which he really liked.

In 1976, when Shrimp Boy was 16, his parents moved the family to San Francisco. By then, he says, he was already an accomplished hoodlum — experienced in juvenile detention, practiced in not squealing to the police. Shrimp Boy carried with him to America a letter of recommendation, a to-whom-it-may-concern note from his Hong Kong gang leader. Shrimp Boy gave the letter to an elder in Chinatown, who introduced him around.

Instead of going to school, he applied his considerable ambition to climbing the tong ranks. The tongs were started by Chinese immigrants who came to California in the mid-1800s, for the Gold Rush and to work on the railroad. The immigrants experienced terrible discrimination. In 1856, the Californian Committee on Mines and Mining Interests declared the Chinese ‘‘a disgusting scab upon the fair face of society — a putrefying sore upon the body politic.’’ The Chinese looked to their own community for help. ‘‘No matter what you need, you go to the tong,” says Ko-lin Chin, a professor at the Rutgers School of Criminal Justice, describing 1800s San Francisco. ‘‘If a Chinese man dies and he doesn’t want to be buried in the United States, the tongs help ship the body back to China. If you need a notice read in English. If you need a loan.’’ The tongs also provided extralegal amenities, like prostitution, opium and gambling dens. To this day, tongs serve a range of roles, and they have spread to Chinatowns nationwide. Some tongs focus on extortion, others on scholarship funds. ‘‘It depends on the leadership,’’ says Chin, who notes that many tongs have a street gang, if not a connection to organized crime.

When Shrimp Boy was 17, he was dropped by a Hop Sing Tong lieutenant at a home in suburban Hillsborough. The tong, he says, had been hired by La Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian mafia, to land the resident of the house in the hospital for three months. Dressed in bell bottoms, a jeans jacket and platform shoes, he grabbed a two-by-four that happened to be propped by the front door. He beat the man brutally and left the house two minutes later. The next day, in a Chinatown restaurant, a tong boss gave Shrimp Boy a slice of custard pie and an envelope containing $3,000.

Shrimp Boy’s first arrest and conviction came a year later, in 1978. He was charged with armed robbery after he held up a gambling den and was sentenced to 11 years. At San Quentin, he beat a man with a food tray — Shrimp Boy told me that he used it like a tennis racket: ‘‘backhand, forehand, backhand, forehand’’ — and landed himself in solitary. A prison psychologist told Shrimp Boy he needed a vocation outside of crime. He studied to become a deep-sea welder, but a prison riot broke out, and he couldn’t complete his training. So he started dealing heroin in prison instead.

Upon his release, in 1985, Shrimp Boy took a bus to San Francisco. At a Vietnamese noodle shop, he tried to motivate himself to buy the Chinese newspaper and look for a real job. But then he noticed some girls outside. Pretty classy for hookers, Shrimp Boy thought. Within an hour, he was talking with them about how much money they made through their pimps and whether they would rather work for him. He rented a big Victorian house, and within a matter of months, Shrimp Boy says, his escort business was producing more cash than he could handle. He started rolling profits into a variety of enterprises: cocaine distribution, fencing stolen weapons, Rolexes, jewelry and pills. Shrimp Boy talks about that stage of his life as normal people often talk about college: Crazy time! Learned a lot! Needed to grow up and move on.

The first time Shrimp Boy tried to go straight, he says, was in 1989. He wanted to make his mother proud. She gave him a ritual bath with grapefruit leaves, to cleanse his spirit. Shrimp Boy found work at the Lucky market in Daly City, bagging groceries for $4.50 an hour. He worked hard and was promoted to janitorial staff at $7.25 — but then, he says, a member of the San Francisco Police Department’s gang task force called his boss, who became suspicious, and Shrimp Boy left his job. Next he found employment as a bodyguard, a slippery slope. One night he was working in a casino in Oakland, looking sharp and professional in his sleeveless undershirt and double-breasted suit, and before Shrimp Boy knew it he was walking around Stow Lake, in Golden Gate Park, with Peter Chong, a leader of a Hong Kong gang called Wo Hop To, talking about uniting the East Coast and West Coast heroin trades.

In April 1992, Shrimp Boy flew to New York to meet with gang leaders in Chinatown. Soon after, documents show, he was arrested and charged with 48 counts, among them RICO activities (the acronym refers to charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act), conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine, murder for hire, cocaine possession, arson, unlicensed firearm sales and transfers and a slew of interstate-commerce crimes — so many charges that the government split the case into two trials. Chong, meanwhile, fled to Hong Kong.

Shrimp Boy’s credo was: Never cooperate with the government. If you do, you have to debrief, or snitch — outlaw suicide. But to Shrimp Boy’s dismay, by the time the first of his two cases reached trial, in 1995, many of his associates had ratted him out. In his first trial, he was found guilty on six counts; he was later sentenced to 24 years. (The second trial ended in a hung jury.) Once incarcerated at California’s Federal Correctional Institute, Dublin, Shrimp Boy says, he reached out to his tong to evaluate the loyalty of his underlings. He found that they had turned on him. Shortly after, Chong, who had been extradited to the United States, betrayed Shrimp Boy as well — or so Shrimp Boy claims — by hiring away the attorney who represented Shrimp Boy in the second trial.

Shrimp Boy’s world crumbled: A gangster without a code or crew is just a lone felon. In 2000, in a prison conference room, Shrimp Boy says, he accepted a plea deal and decided to give up the underworld. Documents show that the government promised him a new life under the witness-protection program, an S visa (residence for a witness who assists law enforcement) and release on time served. In exchange, Shrimp Boy would testify against Chong. (Chong served time for racketeering and was released in 2008.) Shrimp Boy describes this act of testifying — aiding the United States attorney, selling out his onetime partner and the only set of values he had ever known — as the hardest experience of his life.

The 137-page affidavit of Special Agent Emmanuel Pascua, the document that led to Shrimp Boy’s most recent arrest, is a great read for a legal filing — drama, comedy, classical Greek tragedy, all right there on paper. It recounts the story of Operation Whitesuit, laying out the case against ‘‘Kwok Cheung Chow, a.k.a. Raymond Chow, a.k.a. Shrimp Boy, a.k.a. Ha Jai, hereinafter Chow,’’ along with 25 other Bay Area residents, including State Senator Leland Yee. (Yee and three other defendants pleaded guilty in July.) The F.B.I.’s most prominent informant is identified only as UCE (undercover employee) 4599. He posed as an East Coast emissary from La Cosa Nostra looking to make a name for himself on the West Coast. UCE 4599 met Shrimp Boy in May 2010. For the next four years, he ingratiated himself into Shrimp Boy’s world.

As Shrimp Boy explained to me over our many visits and phone calls, after he cut his deal with the federal government, things did not go as planned. Shrimp Boy was released on time served, but the government did not deliver the S visa or a new identity through witness protection. Instead, Shrimp Boy claims, the F.B.I. dropped him with an ankle monitor back in San Francisco — as bait to catch other criminals, he believes. At the time, he said, he had no real friends (who’s loyal to a snitch?), no legal means of earning money, no faith in gangsterism. Even if he had wanted to pursue organized crime, life was passing him by. ‘‘The new generation is about crime in the computer,’’ Shrimp Boy said — credit-card fraud, identity theft, cyber extortion. ‘‘I don’t even know how to use the computer.’’ Rudderless, Shrimp Boy lived with his brother and his brother’s girlfriend, who complained about how much toilet paper he used. He started having panic attacks. He visited a psychiatrist, who prescribed Ambien and sent him home.

Shrimp Boy says that at that point he ‘‘wanted to be part of society.’’ Toward that end, he started volunteering with gang-prevention organizations, telling high-school students to steer clear of trouble. As Shrimp Boy explains, ‘‘You get a gun, and then you want a bigger gun, and then you want a bigger gun. It’s human nature.’’ By 2007, Shrimp Boy was talking to dozens of community groups a year, including Asian-American studies classes at San Francisco State University. In 2009, he volunteered to organize San Francisco’s city-funded Chinatown Night Market — although when news of his involvement came to light, the city decided to skip the night market altogether that year. In 2012, Shrimp Boy spoke about his life to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, at the request of Steven Ford, a lieutenant with the city’s police department. During these years, Shrimp Boy acknowledges, he also rebuilt his network in Chinatown. In 2006, the Ghee Kung Tong’s leader, known as the dragonhead, was murdered, and Shrimp Boy ascended to that role, though he claims he was assiduously clean.

The affidavit of Special Agent Pascua indicates that during the years of Operation Whitesuit, Shrimp Boy was working on ‘‘a potential book deal and movie proposition regarding his life,’’ which would have allowed him to support himself legally. He was also dating Lo. When the two met in 2008, Lo told me, she considered herself to be ‘‘not such a good Chinese person.’’ She and Shrimp Boy fell in love and began a cultural exchange. Shrimp Boy took Lo to the tong, showed her how to bow down at the shrines and pay proper respects. Lo took Shrimp Boy to art openings, nice restaurants and the gay-pride parade.

During the time that Shrimp Boy was dragonhead, the affidavit also indicates, tong members sold drugs, contraband and illegal firearms; distributed drugs; and laundered money. Shrimp Boy deliberately maintained some distance from the crimes. As the affidavit reads, ‘‘Chow did not want to know anything because he would not be guilty if he did not know anything.’’

Shrimp Boy presented himself to UCE 4599 in mature, upstanding terms: ‘‘a judge within his organization’’; an esteemed elder dedicating his life to promoting ‘‘grand ideas’’; a tough guy who ‘‘could move hundreds of kilos of drugs if he wanted to,’’ but did not.

To a reader of the affidavit, Shrimp Boy comes across as a man who likes the idea of being normal, who even makes moves in that direction, but who has a fuzzy understanding of the concept. At one point, after UCE 4599 closed a deal to sell stolen cigarettes to China, he thanked Shrimp Boy.

‘‘I never did anything,’’ Shrimp Boy said.

‘‘Well, I did,’’ said Shrimp Boy’s driver, George Nieh, who was standing there. UCE 4599 gave Nieh $5,000.

Another time, UCE 4599 thanked Shrimp Boy for the opportunity to work with Nieh on a separate transaction, and he slipped an envelope containing $2,000 into Shrimp Boy’s pocket. ‘‘No, no, I didn’t give you the opportunity,’’ Shrimp Boy said. ‘‘You make your own opportunity.’’ He further protested: ‘‘Damn, that is bribery money, dude — that’s not good.’’ He did not give the money back.

At moments in the affidavit, the relationship between Shrimp Boy and UCE 4599 comes across as intimate, close to tender. Shrimp Boy whispered in UCE 4599’s ear in a karaoke bar. He told UCE 4599 that he loved him. But Shrimp Boy also said to UCE 4599 that ‘‘if anything happened to him, the person who did it would pay a tremendous price, and their life would disappear.’’

During the 19 months since his arrest, Shrimp Boy has been jogging in place in his cell, meditating and thinking about good and evil, whether he has lived a decent life. ‘‘Everybody has to grow up,’’ he told me. ‘‘I have to grow up more than most.’’ If he gets out, Shrimp Boy says, he will take care of his parents. He will pay taxes. Lo is not sure what their relationship will be when he gets out, but she still visits Shrimp Boy every weekend and attends his court hearings. ‘‘I love him so much,’’ she told me. But she needs a responsible adult in her life, a real partner, one who can read a grocery list and help fill out school forms.

‘‘I know I caused the trouble,’’ Shrimp Boy says. ‘‘I would do anything to fix it.’’ He has many regrets. Chief among them is that he never had children. ‘‘I didn’t see that when I was younger,’’ he told me. ‘‘The guy staying home, spending most of his time with his family — I envy the man like that. I don’t have anything. I’m 55, and I’m still in a county jail.’’

Serra is eager for the courtroom drama to start. He described defending a client before a jury as ‘‘like an acid experience. You merge — it’s like shooting someone up into your veins.’’ He continues to see Shrimp Boy as ‘‘transparent, courageous, spiritual.’’ But the road to the Nov. 2 court date has been uneven. On Sept. 9, six of Shrimp Boy’s co-defendants pleaded guilty, including George Nieh. Those pleas cleared the way for Shrimp Boy to go to trial alone, which Serra thinks is to his advantage. Less auspicious, the United States attorneys recently informed the court that they have evidence linking Shrimp Boy to the murders of a tong leader and a lieutenant. The prosecution noted in a court filing that it will use the fact that Shrimp Boy ‘‘greenlighted’’ murder to highlight ‘‘the true nature of the enterprise run by Chow and his associates.’’ After all, the prosecution reminded the court, sanctioning an enemy’s death is not standard at ‘‘the Moose Lodge or the local Rotary Club or legitimate tongs.’’

Still, most days, Shrimp Boy remains upbeat. ‘‘I’m a good man, I’m a regular man,’’ he tells himself. When he is feeling down, he listens to the Operation Whitesuit recordings and feels better hearing himself refuse the many criminal offers. ‘‘So many times I’m sitting here, I done something wrong!’’ he said. ‘‘Old temptations and addictions, I didn’t fall for that. Wow. I turned down a lot of opportunity.’’

He is especially proud of his discipline. ‘‘It’s like they baked me this cake, this delicious cake, and tried to get me to eat it, even rubbed it in my face,’’ he said. ‘‘But I didn’t eat it. I stuck to my diet.’’",REAL
What Do We Really Know About Osama bin Laden’s Death?,"His method in those books was to combine exhaustive reporting with vivid storytelling. It helps that Bowden tends to write about historical events a long time after they take place. People are typically eager to sit down with him, and they are usually able to speak freely. One interview subject leads to another, who leads to another, and so on. It’s a process that can take years.

The bin Laden book proved to be a very different sort of undertaking. Bowden was trying to tell the story just months after it happened. And only a small number of people — a handful of senior administration and military officials and the Navy SEALs who carried out the operation — had been privy to the events of that evening. There was virtually no paper trail for Bowden to follow; the government had classified all the documents relating to the raid, including the record of the C.I.A.’s search for bin Laden. Bowden had to request interviews through official administration channels and hope for the best.

His book, ‘‘The Finish,’’ was published in the fall of 2012, and the story it tells is one that is by now familiar. The C.I.A., working in the shadows for many years, had identified a courier whom agency officers eventually traced to a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Agents studied this compound for months via distant satellite cameras but couldn’t be certain that bin Laden was inside. If he was — a 55/45 percent proposition, Obama said later — the president did not want to let him slip away. The safe play was to reduce the compound to dust with a bomb or missiles, but this would risk civilian casualties and also make it impossible to verify the kill with any certainty. Obama instead sent in a team of 23 Navy SEALs in two Black Hawk helicopters. The whole mission almost fell apart when one of the helicopters had to crash-land near an animal pen inside the compound. But the SEALs adapted on the fly and were soon making their assault, breaching gates and doors with C-4 charges and, eventually, killing their target. Before leaving, they blew up the damaged Black Hawk. As they flew off, a giant fire raged inside the compound. The Pakistani government was none the wiser until the SEALs were long gone.

This irresistible story would be told in many different forms in the months and years that followed. Bowden’s was one of several books, but there were also countless newspaper articles, magazine features, television news programs and ultimately the 2012 movie ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty,’’ which billed itself as the narrative of ‘‘the Greatest Manhunt in History.’’ In this sense, the killing of bin Laden was not only a victory for the U.S. military but also for the American storytelling machine, which kicked into high gear pretty much the moment the terrorist leader’s dead body hit the floor.

Last spring, Bowden got another unexpected call on his cellphone. He was on his way home to Pennsylvania from a meeting in New York with his publisher about his next book, the story of the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War. On the other end of the line was Seymour Hersh, the investigative reporter.

Hersh was calling to ask about the photographs of bin Laden’s burial at sea — carried out, the U.S. government said, in accordance with Islamic custom — that Bowden had described in detail at the end of ‘‘The Finish,’’ as well as in an adaptation from the book that appeared in Vanity Fair. ‘‘One frame shows the body wrapped in a weighted shroud,’’ Bowden had written. ‘‘The next shows it lying diagonally on a chute, feet overboard. In the next frame, the body is hitting the water. In the next it is visible just below the surface, ripples spreading outward. In the last frame there are only circular ripples on the surface. The mortal remains of Osama bin Laden were gone for good.’’

Hersh wanted to know: Had Bowden actually seen those photos?

Bowden told Hersh that he had not. He explained that they were described to him by someone who had.

Hersh said the photographs didn’t exist. Indeed, he went on, the entire narrative of how the United States hunted down and killed bin Laden was a fabrication. He told Bowden that he was getting ready to publish the real story of what happened in Abbottabad.

Bowden said he found Hersh’s claims hard to believe. Hersh tried to sympathize. ‘‘Nobody likes to get played,’’ he said, adding that he meant no offense.

‘‘I said, ‘No offense taken,’ ’’ Bowden recalled. ‘‘I told him that he was, after all, Seymour Hersh, and that he ought to do whatever he thought best. But that in this case, I feared he was mistaken.’’

It’s hard to overstate the degree to which the killing of Osama bin Laden transformed American politics. From a purely practical standpoint, it enabled Obama to recast himself as a bold leader, as opposed to an overly cautious one, in advance of his 2012 re-election campaign. This had an undeniable impact on the outcome of that election. (‘‘Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive,’’ Joe Biden was fond of boasting on the campaign trail.) Strategically, the death of bin Laden allowed Obama to declare victory over Al Qaeda, giving him the cover he needed to begin phasing U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. And it almost single-handedly redeemed the C.I.A., turning a decade-long failure of intelligence into one of the greatest triumphs in the history of the agency.

But bin Laden’s death had an even greater effect on the American psyche. Symbolically, it brought a badly wanted moment of moral clarity, of unambiguous American valor, to a murky war defined by ethical compromise and even at times by collective shame. It completed the historical arc of the 9/11 attacks. The ghastly image of collapsing towers that had been fixed in our collective minds for years was dislodged by one of Obama and his senior advisers huddled tensely around a table in the White House Situation Room, watching closely as justice was finally brought to the perpetrator.

The first dramatic reconstruction of the raid itself — ‘‘Getting bin Laden: What Happened That Night in Abbottabad’’ — was written by a freelancer named Nicholas Schmidle and published in The New Yorker just three months after the operation. The son of a Marine general, Schmidle spent a couple of years in Pakistan and has written on counterterrorism for many publications, including this magazine. His New Yorker story was a cinematic account of military daring, sweeping but also granular in its detail, from the ‘‘metallic cough of rounds being chambered’’ inside the two Black Hawks as the SEALs approached the compound, to the mud that ‘‘sucked at their boots’’ when they hit the ground. One of the SEALs who shot bin Laden, Matt Bissonnette, added a more personal dimension to the story a year later in a best-selling book, ‘‘No Easy Day.’’ Bowden focused on Washington, taking readers inside the White House as the president navigated what would become a defining moment of his presidency. And then there was ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty,’’ which chronicled the often barbaric C.I.A. interrogations that the agency said helped lead the United States to bin Laden’s compound.

The official narrative of the hunt for and killing of bin Laden at first seemed like a clear portrait, but in effect it was more like a composite sketch from multiple perspectives: the Pentagon, the White House and the C.I.A. And when you studied that sketch a little more closely, not everything looked quite right. Almost immediately, the administration had to correct some of the most significant details of the raid. Bin Laden had not been ‘‘engaged in a firefight,’’ as the deputy national-security adviser, John Brennan, initially told reporters; he’d been unarmed. Nor had he used one of his wives as a human shield. The president and his senior advisers hadn’t been watching a ‘‘live feed’’ of the raid in the Situation Room; the operation had not been captured on helmet-cams. But there were also some more unsettling questions about how the whole story had been constructed. Schmidle acknowledged after his article was published that he had never actually spoken with any of the 23 SEALs. Some details of Bissonnette’s account of the raid contradicted those of another ex-SEAL, Robert O’Neill, who claimed in Esquire and on Fox News to have fired the fatal bullet. Public officials with security clearances told reporters that the torture scenes that were so realistically depicted in ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty’’ had not in fact played any role in helping us find bin Laden.

Then there was the sheer improbability of the story, which asked us to believe that Obama sent 23 SEALs on a seemingly suicidal mission, invading Pakistani air space without air or ground cover, fast-roping into a compound that, if it even contained bin Laden, by all rights should have been heavily guarded. And according to the official line, all of this was done without any sort of cooperation or even assurances from the Pakistani military or intelligence service. How likely was that? Abbottabad is basically a garrison town; the conspicuously large bin Laden compound — three stories, encircled by an 18-foot-high concrete wall topped with barbed wire — was less than two miles from Pakistan’s equivalent of West Point. And what about the local police? Were they really unaware that an enormous American helicopter had crash-landed in their neighborhood? And why were we learning so much about a covert raid by a secret special-operations unit in the first place?

American history is filled with war stories that subsequently unraveled. Consider the Bush administration’s false claims about Saddam Hussein’s supposed arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Or the imagined attack on a U.S. vessel in the Gulf of Tonkin. During the Bay of Pigs, the government inflated the number of fighters it dispatched to Cuba in hopes of encouraging local citizens to rise up and join them. When the operation failed, the government quickly deflated the number, claiming that it hadn’t been an invasion at all but rather a modest attempt to deliver supplies to local guerrillas. More recently, the Army reported that the ex-N.F.L. safety Pat Tillman was killed by enemy fire, rather than acknowledging that he was accidentally shot in the head by a machine-gunner from his own unit.

These false stories couldn’t have reached the public without the help of the media. Reporters don’t just find facts; they look for narratives. And an appealing narrative can exert a powerful gravitational pull that winds up bending facts in its direction. During the Iraq war, reporters informed us that a mob of jubilant Iraqis toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square. Never mind that there were so few local people trying to pull the statue down that they needed the help of a U.S. military crane. Reporters also built Pvt. Jessica Lynch into a war hero who had resisted her captors during an ambush in Iraq, when in fact her weapon had jammed and she remained in her Humvee. In an Op-Ed essay in The Times about the Lynch story in 2003, it was Bowden himself who explained this phenomenon as ‘‘the tendency to weave what little we know into a familiar shape — often one resembling the narrative arc of a film.’’

Was the story of Osama bin Laden’s death yet another example of American mythmaking? Had Bowden and, for that matter, all of us been seduced by a narrative that was manufactured expressly for our benefit? Or were these questions themselves just paranoid?

‘‘The story stunk from Day 1,’’ Hersh told me. It was a miserably hot summer day in Washington, and we were sitting in his office, a two-room suite in an anonymous office complex near Dupont Circle, where Hersh works alone. There’s no nameplate on the door; the walls of the anteroom are crowded with journalism awards. ‘‘I have a lot of fun here,’’ he said, amid the clutter of cardboard boxes and precariously stacked books. ‘‘I can do whatever I want.’’

Within days of the bin Laden raid, Hersh told me, ‘‘I knew there was a big story there.’’ He spent the next four years, on and off, trying to get it. What he wound up publishing, this May in The London Review of Books, was no incremental effort to poke a few holes in the administration’s story. It was a 10,000-word refutation of the entire official narrative, sourced largely to a retired U.S. senior intelligence official, with corroboration from two ‘‘longtime consultants to the Special Operations Command.’’ Hersh confidently walked readers through an alternate version of all the familiar plot points in a dispassionate, just-the-facts tone, turning a story of patient perseverance, careful planning and derring-do into one of luck (good and bad), damage control and opportunism.

Hersh, who is 78, was reluctant to cooperate when I told him that I was interested in writing about his article. (‘‘I’ve gotta bunch of problems with your request,’’ his first email to me began.) He wanted me to follow up on his reporting instead and suggested that I might start by looking into Pakistan’s radar system, which he said was far too sophisticated to allow two U.S. helicopters to enter the country’s airspace undetected. (‘‘Those dimwitted third-world guys just can’t get anything right,’’ he wrote sarcastically, meaning of course the Pakistanis would have been aware of two military helicopters flying into the heart of their country.) Hersh, who worked at The New York Times for seven years in the 1970s, didn’t think the paper would allow me to take his claims seriously. ‘‘If you did so,’’ he wrote, ‘‘you better be sure not to let your wife start the car for the next few months.’’ But after a little prodding, he relented and spent the better part of a day with me, describing his reporting as thoroughly as he felt he could without compromising his sources.

Hersh’s most consequential claim was about how bin Laden was found in the first place. It was not years of painstaking intelligence-gathering, he wrote, that led the United States to the courier and, ultimately, to bin Laden. Instead, the location was revealed by a ‘‘walk-in’’ — a retired Pakistani intelligence officer who was after the $25 million reward that the United States had promised anyone who helped locate him. For that matter, bin Laden was hardly ‘‘in hiding’’ at all; his compound in Abbottabad was actually a safe house, maintained by the Pakistani intelligence service. When the United States confronted Pakistani intelligence officials with this information, Hersh wrote, they eventually acknowledged it was true and even conceded to provide a DNA sample to prove it.

According to Hersh’s version, then, the daring raid wasn’t especially daring. The Pakistanis allowed the U.S. helicopters into their airspace and cleared out the guards at the compound before the SEALs arrived. Hersh’s sources told him the United States and Pakistani intelligence officials agreed that Obama would wait a week before announcing that bin Laden had been killed in a ‘‘drone strike somewhere in the mountains on the Pakistan/Afghanistan border.’’ But the president was forced to go public right away, because the crash and subsequent destruction of the Black Hawk — among the rare facts in the official story that Hersh does not dispute — were going to make it impossible to keep the operation under wraps.

As if those assertions weren’t significant enough, Hersh went on to make some even wilder claims. He wrote, for instance, that bin Laden had not been given a proper Islamic burial at sea; the SEALs threw his remains out of their helicopter. He claimed not just that the Pakistanis had seized bin Laden in 2006, but that Saudi Arabia had paid for his upkeep in the years that followed, and that the United States had instructed Pakistan to arrest an innocent man who was a sometime C.I.A. asset as the fall guy for the major in the Pakistani Army who had collected bin Laden’s DNA sample.

What was perhaps most shocking of all, though, was that this elaborate narrative was being unspooled not by some basement autodidact but by one of America’s greatest investigative reporters, the man who exposed the massacre of hundreds of Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai (1969), who revealed a clandestine C.I.A. program to spy on antiwar dissidents (1974) and who detailed the shocking story of the abuses at Abu Ghraib (2004). Could the bin Laden article be another major Hersh scoop?

‘‘It’s always possible,’’ Bowden told me. ‘‘But given the sheer number of people I talked to from different parts of government, for a lie to have been that carefully orchestrated and sustained to me gets into faked-moon-landing territory.’’ Other reporters have been less generous still. ‘‘What’s true in the story isn’t new, and what’s new in the story isn’t true,’’ said Peter Bergen of CNN, who wrote his own best-selling account of the hunting and killing of bin Laden, ‘‘Manhunt.’’ And government officials were least receptive of all. Josh Earnest, then the White House spokesman, said Hersh’s ‘‘story is riddled with inaccuracies and outright falsehoods.’’ Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said it was ‘‘largely a fabrication.’’ (There were ‘‘too many inaccuracies to even bother going through them line by line.’’) The administration pretty much left it at that, though some of Hersh’s critics have pointed to classified documents made public by Edward Snowden revealing a long history of C.I.A. surveillance of the Abbottabad compound as proof that its location hadn’t simply been revealed by a walk-in.

This sort of reception is nothing new for Hersh. A Pentagon spokesman at the time of Abu Ghraib, Lawrence Di Rita, described one of his many (now unchallenged) articles for The New Yorker on the scandal as ‘‘the most hysterical piece of journalist malpractice I have ever observed.’’ Still, Hersh got worked up in some of the interviews he gave after the publication of the bin Laden piece. ‘‘I don’t care if you don’t like my story!’’ he told a public-radio host during one grilling. ‘‘I don’t care!’’ But with time, his petulance cooled into a kind of amusement. ‘‘High-camp’’ was one adjective he used to describe the administration’s version of the events.

At one point in our conversation, I reminded Hersh that I wasn’t going to offer a definitive judgment on what happened. I didn’t want to reinterview the administration officials who had already given their accounts of the events to other journalists. I saw this as more of a media story, a case study in how constructed narratives become accepted truth. This felt like a cop-out to him, as he explained in a long email the next day. He said that I was sidestepping the real issue, that I was ‘‘turning this into a ‘he-said, she-said’ dilemma,’’ instead of coming to my own conclusion about whose version was right. It was then that he introduced an even more disturbing notion: What if no one’s version could be trusted?

‘‘Of course there is no reason for you or any other journalist to take what was said to me by unnamed sources at face value,’’ Hersh wrote. ‘‘But it is my view that there also is no reason for journalists to take at face value what a White House or administration spokesman said on or off the record in the aftermath or during a crisis.’’

For those in and around the news business, the fact that Hersh’s report appeared in The London Review of Books and not The New Yorker, his usual outlet, was a story in its own right, one that hasn’t been told in full before. (Editors and reporters may not be as secretive as intelligence officials, but they like to keep a tight lid on their operational details, too.)

A week or so after the raid, Hersh called The New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick. In 2009, Hersh wrote a story for the magazine about the growing concern among U.S. officials that Pakistan’s large nuclear arsenal could fall into the hands of extremists inside the country’s military. Now he let Remnick know that two of his sources — one in Pakistan, the other in Washington — were telling him something else: The administration was lying about the bin Laden operation.

One of The New Yorker’s staff writers, Dexter Filkins, was already planning a trip to Pakistan for a different assignment. It is rare, but not unprecedented, for The New Yorker to run double-bylined articles, and the magazine decided to pursue one. It paired Filkins with Hersh, asking Filkins to report the Pakistani side — in particular, the notion that Pakistan had secretly cooperated with the United States — while Hersh would keep following leads from Washington. But Filkins, who covered Afghanistan and Pakistan for The Times before moving to The New Yorker, spent about a week running the tip by sources inside the Pakistani government and military with little success.

‘‘It wasn’t even that I was getting angry denials,’’ Filkins told me. ‘‘I was getting blank stares.’’ Filkins said the mood on the ground completely contradicted Hersh’s claim; the Pakistani military seemed humiliated about having been kept in the dark by the Americans. Remnick told him to move on. He ended up writing about a Pakistani journalist who was murdered, probably by the country’s intelligence service, the I.S.I., after detailing the links between Islamist militants and the Pakistani military.

In the meantime, The New Yorker published Schmidle’s account of the bin Laden raid, and, soon after, brought Schmidle on as a staff writer. (In an email, Schmidle told me his subsequent reporting has only confirmed his initial account. Regarding the possibility ‘‘that some inside the Pakistani military or intelligence services knew that bin Laden was living in that house, I think it’s entirely plausible, though I’ve not seen any proof,’’ he wrote.)

Hersh plowed ahead by himself, working his sources, trying to flesh out his counternarrative. Three years later he sent a draft to The New Yorker. After reading it a few times, Remnick told Hersh that he didn’t think he had the story nailed down. He suggested that Hersh continue his reporting and see where it took him. Instead, Hersh gave the story to The London Review of Books.

Hersh has never been on The New Yorker’s staff, preferring to remain a freelancer. But he has strong ties to the magazine. He published his first article there in 1971 and has written hundreds of thousands of words for the magazine since then, including, most recently, an essay about visiting My Lai with his family that was published only weeks before his London Review of Books article on bin Laden. (His son Joshua, now a reporter for Buzzfeed, was a New Yorker fact-checker for many years.) Remnick has published some of Hersh’s most provocative articles and, for that matter, plenty of other major national-security stories that the government would have preferred to keep buried.

But the bin Laden report wasn’t the first one by Hersh that Remnick rejected because he considered the sourcing too thin. In 2013 and 2014, he passed on two Hersh articles about a deadly sarin gas attack in Syria, each of which claimed the attack was not launched by the Assad regime, the presumed culprit, but by Syrian rebels, in collaboration with the Turkish government. Those articles also landed in The London Review of Books. Like the bin Laden article, each was widely questioned upon publication, with critics arguing that the once-legendary reporter was increasingly favoring provocation over rigor. (Hersh still stands by both stories.)

The media would certainly have treated Hersh’s bin Laden story differently if it had been published in The New Yorker, which is highly regarded for its thorough review process. But Hersh insists that the L.R.B. was just as thorough, if not more so. His editor, Christian Lorentzen, told me that three fact-checkers worked on the bin Laden article, and he also spoke directly to Hersh’s key sources, including the retired American intelligence official identified in the article as the ‘‘major U.S. source for the account.’’

Even if the fact-checking process at The London Review of Books was as thorough as Hersh and the magazine say, we are still left trusting his unnamed sources. Should we? Hersh’s first Abu Ghraib article was based on an internal Army report, but many of the most important revelations in his work come from mid­level bureaucrats, ambassadors, C.I.A. station chiefs and four-star generals whose identities are known to only his editors and fact-checkers. The promise of anonymity is an essential tool for reporters. It changed the course of history (in Watergate, most prominently) and helped make Hersh’s illustrious career. But it also invariably leaves doubts about the motivation of the sources and thus their credibility.

Slide Show

Hersh’s instincts — to him, every story stinks from Day 1 — have served him well. But there are inherent perils in making a career of digging up the government’s deepest secrets. National-security reporters are almost never present at the events in question, and they are usually working without photos or documents, too. Their hardest facts consist almost entirely of what (unnamed) people say. It is a bedrock value of journalism that reporters must never get facts wrong, but faithfully reproducing what people tell you is just the beginning. You have to also decide which facts and which voices to include and how best to assemble this material into an accurate, coherent narrative: a story. In making these judgments, even the best might miss a nuance or choose the wrong fact or facts to emphasize. As Steve Coll, a New Yorker staff writer and the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, told me, ‘‘You’d want an investigative reporter’s reputation to not be 100 percent right all of the time, but to be mostly right, to be directionally right.’’

Hersh may have been the first journalist to write that a secret informant had steered the United States to bin Laden’s compound, but he was by no means the only one who had heard this rumor. Coll was another. ‘‘In my case, it was described to me as a specific Pakistani officer in the intelligence service,’’ Coll, the author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the C.I.A. and Afghanistan, told me one afternoon in his office at Columbia. ‘‘I even had a name that I’ve been working on for four years.’’

Intuitively, the notion of a walk-in makes sense. Secret informants have led the United States to virtually every high-value terrorist target tracked to Pakistan, including Ramzi Yousef, the first World Trade Center bomber, and Mir Aimal Kansi, who killed two C.I.A. employees in an attack on Langley in 1993. ‘‘The idea that the C.I.A. stitched this together, and torture worked and they found the car and they found the courier, then they found the license plate and they followed it to the house — that had always seemed to those of us on the beat like it was very elaborate,’’ Coll said.

But Coll has never been able to confirm the tipper story. The closest he came was a conversation with an American intelligence officer who had worked with the man said to have been the informant. ‘‘I said, ‘Do you know this guy?’ ’’ Coll recalled. ‘‘He said: ‘Yeah, I do know him. I used to work very closely with him.’ I said, ‘Is this bio that I’ve been given accurate?’ He said, ‘Yeah, it’s accurate.’ I said, ‘I’ve been told he took the $25 million and is in witness protection.’ He paused, and he said, ‘Hmm, that’s the sort of thing he would do.’ ’’

From the beginning, it seemed hard to believe that high-level Pakistani officials weren’t aware of bin Laden’s presence in their country; several U.S. officials even publicly said as much in the aftermath of the raid. Pakistan conducted its own secret investigation into the matter, which was leaked to Al Jazeera in 2013. The Abbottabad Commission Report, as it was known, found no evidence that Pakistan was harboring bin Laden. Instead, it concluded that the world’s most wanted man was able to move freely around the country for nine years because of widespread incompetence among military and intelligence authorities.

The most detailed exploration of the question of Pakistani complicity in sheltering bin Laden appeared in this magazine in March 2014. It came from a book written by a Times correspondent, Carlotta Gall, who reported that a source inside the I.S.I. told her that Pakistan’s intelligence service ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden. ‘‘The desk was wholly deniable by virtually everyone at the I.S.I. — such is how supersecret intelligence units operate — but the top military bosses knew about it, I was told,’’ Gall wrote.

More controversial is Hersh’s claim that Pakistan knew in advance about the SEAL team raid and allowed it to proceed, even helped facilitate it. This is the starkest departure from the standard story as it was reported previously. Logically, it would require us to accept that the U.S. government trusted the Pakistanis to help it kill bin Laden, and that the humiliation that Pakistan’s military and intelligence reportedly felt in the aftermath of the raid was either a ruse or the product of some even deeper U.S.-Pakistani intrigue. Is there any evidence to support this claim or, really, anything we can latch onto beyond Hersh’s unnamed sources?

Eleven days after the raid, an unbylined story appeared on GlobalPost, an American website specializing in foreign reporting. The dateline was Abbottabad; the story was headlined: ‘‘Bin Laden Raid: Neighbors Say Pakistan Knew.’’ A half-dozen people who lived near bin Laden’s compound told the reporter that plainclothes security personnel — ‘‘either Pakistani intelligence or military officers’’ — knocked on their doors a couple of hours before the raid and instructed them to turn the lights off and remain indoors until further notice. Some local people also told the reporter that they were directed not to speak to the media, especially the foreign media.

When I contacted the chief executive of GlobalPost, Philip Balboni, he told me he considered trying to aggressively publicize this narrative when he first posted it. ‘‘[B]ut that would have required resources that we did not possess at the time, and the information against it was so overwhelming that even we had to wonder if our sources were right,’’ he wrote me in an email.

Balboni put me in touch with the reporter, Aamir Latif, a 41-year-old Pakistani journalist. Latif, a former foreign correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, told me that he traveled to Abbottabad the day after bin Laden was killed and reported there for a couple of days. I asked him if he still believed that there was some level of Pakistani awareness of the raid. ‘‘Not awareness,’’ he answered instantly. ‘‘There was coordination and cooperation.’’

Latif, who kept his name off the original post because of the sensitivity of the subject in Pakistan, said that people in the area told him that they heard the U.S. helicopters and that surely the Pakistani military had, too: ‘‘The whole country was awake, only the Pakistani Army was asleep? What does that suggest to you?’’ Gall has also written that bin Laden’s neighbors heard the explosions at the compound and contacted the local police, but that army commanders told the police to stand down and leave the response to the military. The SEALs were on the ground for 40 minutes, but the Pakistani Army didn’t arrive until after they had left.

Gall’s best guess (and she emphasizes that it is just a guess) is that the United States alerted Pakistan to the bin Laden operation at the 11th hour. ‘‘I have no proof, but the more I think about it and the more I talk to Pakistani friends, the more I think it’s probably true that Kayani and Pasha were in on it,’’ Gall told me, referring to Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who was then the chief of the army staff, and Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, then the director general of the I.S.I. As for killing bin Laden, she said: ‘‘The scenario I imagine is that the Americans watched him and tracked him and never told the Pakistanis because they didn’t trust them, but when they decided to go ahead with the raid, I think they might have gone to Kayani and Pasha and said, ‘We’re going in, and don’t you dare shoot down our helicopters or else.’ ’’ (I should note that not every national-­security reporter, including some at The Times, agrees with Gall about the likelihood of high-level Pakistani complicity in either harboring bin Laden or helping kill him.)

Following Gall’s scenario to its logical conclusion, Pakistan would have faced an unappealing choice after the raid: acknowledge that it had cooperated and risk angering hard-liners for betraying bin Laden and abetting a U.S. military operation on Pakistani soil, or plead ignorance and incompetence.

‘‘The Pakistanis often fall back on, ‘We were incompetent,’ ’’ Gall said. ‘‘They don’t want their countrymen to know what they’re playing at. They fear there will be a backlash.’’

Where does the official bin Laden story stand now? For many, it exists in a kind of liminal state, floating somewhere between fact and mythology. The writing of history is a process, and this story still seems to have a long way to go before the government’s narrative can be accepted as true, or rejected as false.

‘‘It’s all sort of hokey, the whole thing,’’ Robert Baer, a longtime C.I.A. case officer in the Middle East (and the inspiration for the George Clooney character in the movie ‘‘Syriana’’) told me of the government’s version of the events. ‘‘I’ve never seen a White House take that kind of risk. Did the president just wake up one morning and say, ‘Let’s put my presidency on the line right before an election?’ This guy is too smart to put 23 SEALs in harm’s way in a Hollywood-like assassination. He’s too smart.’’ Still, none of Baer’s old friends inside or outside the agency have challenged the administration’s account.

Over time, many of Hersh’s claims could be proved right. What then? We may be justifiably outraged. Pakistan, our putative ally in the war on terror and the beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer aid, would have provided refuge to our greatest enemy — the author of the very act that prompted us to invade Afghanistan. The audacious raid on bin Laden’s compound, our greatest victory in the war on terror, would have been little more than ‘‘a turkey shoot’’ (Hersh’s phrase). Above all, our government would have lied to us.

But should we really be shocked by such a revelation? After all, it would barely register on a scale of government secrecy and deception that includes, in recent years alone, the N.S.A.’s covert wiretapping program and the C.I.A.’s off-the-books network of ‘‘black site’’ prisons. ‘‘White House public-affairs people are not historians, they are not scholars, they are not even journalists,’’ Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, told me. ‘‘They are representing a political entity inside the United States government. Telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth is not their job, and even if it were their job, they would not necessarily be able to do it.’’

Hersh’s version doesn’t require us to believe in the possibility of a governmentwide conspiracy. Myths can be projected through an uncoordinated effort with a variety of people really just doing their jobs. Of course, when enough people are obscuring the truth, the results can seem, well, conspiratorial. Hersh is fond of pointing out that thousands of government employees and contractors presumably knew about the N.S.A.’s wiretapping, but only one, Edward Snowden, came forward.

We can go a step further: The more sensitive the subject, the more likely the government will be to feed us untruths. Consider our relationship with Pakistan, which Obama clearly had on his mind in the aftermath of the raid. In his address to the nation, Obama expressed his gratitude: ‘‘Over the years, I’ve repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was. That is what we’ve done. But it’s important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.’’

Either the line in Obama’s statement wasn’t truthful or the administration’s subsequent disavowal of it wasn’t. But in either case, it’s hard to imagine that telling the whole truth was more important to Obama, or should have been more important, than managing America’s relationship with this unstable ally.

There’s simply no reason to expect the whole truth from the government about the killing of bin Laden. If a tipper led the United States to his compound in Abbottabad, the administration could never say so without putting that individual’s life at risk and making it virtually impossible for the C.I.A. to recruit informants in the future. If Pakistan didn’t want us to acknowledge its cooperation with the raid, we wouldn’t, for fear of igniting the militant backlash Gall mentioned. Hersh himself has written — in The New Yorker — that there is a credible danger of extremists inside Pakistan’s military staging a coup and taking control of its large stockpile of nuclear weapons.

Reporters like to think of themselves as empiricists, but journalism is a soft science. Absent documentation, the grail of national-security reporting, they are only as good as their sources and their deductive reasoning. But what happens when different sources offer different accounts and deductive reasoning can be used to advance any number of contradictory arguments? How do we square Latif’s reporting in Abbottabad and Baer’s skepticism with the official story that Bowden and many others heard?

‘‘As a reporter in this world,’’ Bowden told me, ‘‘you have to always allow for the possibility that you are being lied to, you hope for good reason.’’

We may already know far more about the bin Laden raid than we were ever supposed to. In his 2014 memoir ‘‘Duty,’’ the former secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, wrote that everyone who gathered in the White House Situation Room on the night of the raid had agreed to ‘‘keep mum on the details.’’ ‘‘That commitment lasted about five hours,’’ he added, pointing his finger directly at the White House and the C.I.A: ‘‘They just couldn’t wait to brag and to claim credit.’’

The problem is that amid all of this bragging, it became impossible to know what was true and what wasn’t. Recall ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty,’’ which grossed $130 million at the box office and was in many ways the dominant narrative of the killing of bin Laden. The filmmakers, in numerous interviews, went out of their way to promote their access to government and military sources: The opening credits announced that the film was based on ‘‘firsthand accounts of actual events.’’ And, as a trove of documents made public via the Freedom of Information Act amply demonstrated, the C.I.A. eagerly cooperated with the filmmakers, arranging for the writer and director to meet with numerous analysts and officers who were identified as being involved in the hunt for bin Laden. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, has described the film as ‘‘the first rough cut of history.’’

This was a story that was so good it didn’t need to be fictionalized, or so it seemed. It began with a series of C.I.A.-led torture sessions, which the movie suggested provided the crucial break in the hunt for bin Laden. Only they didn’t, at least according to a report conducted over the course of many years by the Senate Intelligence Committee (and others with access to classified information). Senator Dianne Feinstein, who oversaw the report as the committee’s chairwoman, said she walked out of a screening of the film. ‘‘I couldn’t handle it,’’ she said. ‘‘Because it’s so false.’’ The filmmakers’ intent had presumably been to tell a nuanced story — the ugly truth of how we found bin Laden — but in so doing, they seem to have perpetuated a lie.

It’s not that the truth about bin Laden’s death is unknowable; it’s that we don’t know it. And we can’t necessarily console ourselves with the hope that we will have more answers any time soon; to this day, the final volume of the C.I.A.’s official history of the Bay of Pigs remains classified. We don’t know what happened more than a half-century ago, much less in 2011.

There are different ways to control a narrative. There’s the old-fashioned way: Classify documents that you don’t want seen and, as Gates said, ‘‘keep mum on the details.’’ But there’s also the more modern, social-media-savvy approach: Tell the story you want them to believe. Silence is one way to keep a secret. Talking is another. And they are not mutually exclusive.

‘‘I love the notion that the government isn’t riddled with secrecy,’’ Hersh told me toward the end of our long day together. ‘‘Are you kidding me? They keep more secrets than you can possibly think. There’s stuff going on right now that I know about — amazing stuff that’s going on. I’ll write about it when I can. There’s stuff going out right now, amazing stuff in the Middle East. Are you kidding me? Of course there is. Of course there is.’’",REAL
Stone-Faced Ghosts of the Confederacy,"In front of nearly every courthouse or at the main intersection of nearly every town in the South, you will find a Confederate memorial. From the late 19th century to the early 20th, the icon of choice was not a fountain or an obelisk but a young man in the prime of courage. He is Johnny Reb, staring attentively ahead, at something. One of the few acts at Appomattox that moves so many white Southerners to emotion was the generosity of permitting Gen. Robert E. Lee and his officers to depart with their side arms. It was technically a gallant gesture but arguably Grant’s unconscious acknowledgment of what we now know: that the war didn’t end but would merely be engaged on other battlefields: Klan terrorism, Jim Crow, redlining, housing covenants, voting ­rights restrictions. The most nuanced expression of this unending war can be seen in these stone faces. They do not appear ‘‘at ease’’ (when a soldier can look around); Johnny nearly always has a weapon, eternally ready for the next command.

Building these memorials was the work of the Ladies’ Memorial Associations. Being largely widows’ work, it happened under the radar, so hardly anyone noticed how the taciturn faces of these statues replaced the surly cry of the Confederate soldier, famous for his war whoop, the Rebel Yell. All the noisy arguments for white superiority were replaced by sober talk of states’ rights and the majesty of our Constitution. These faces are the beginning of the most impressive revision of American history in American history.

They also enlarged the boundaries of the Confederacy. Kentucky provided far more Union soldiers to the fight than Confederates. But according to the state’s historic preservation office, monuments specifically dedicated to the Confederacy number 64. The union? 11. And Kentucky is now popularly thought of as situated in the heart of Dixie.

After moving to Virginia in 2011, the photographer Michael Mergen noticed legions of these statues. ‘‘I thought of the idea of portraits,’’ he says. From June to August — motivated by the church shooting in Charleston, S.C., and the gunman’s love of the Confederate battle flag — he photographed nearly 100 of them. All were different, yet similar in their effect of reclaiming the public image of manhood: the stylish mustache, the strong jaw and, of course, the sharp hat. As more famous effigies are reconsidered — Jefferson Davis in Austin, Tex., Nathan Bedford Forrest in Memphis — these truculent defenders of slavery remain at their posts, the serene sentinels of our parks and greenswards, at rest but never at ease.

The Melancholy Mystery of Lullabies,"The first run of the Lullaby Project came about when Cabaniss, who had been working with the pediatrics unit at Jacobi Medical Center, met the staff of the obstetrics department and asked where they could use the most help. Pregnant teenagers, the nurses said. Young, expectant mothers were under tremendous stress and needed to be motivated to attend their medical appointments. They needed a sense of community, and they needed ways to understand the reality of what was happening to them. Cabaniss created a lullaby-writing project as an optional part of the wellness visits. ‘‘The songs became a way to imagine these children that were on their way,’’ he said.

Musical Connections now runs seven lullaby projects a year, two with groups of mothers from New York’s homeless shelters, two with mothers in hospitals, two with teenage mothers and one at the Rikers Island women’s correctional facility, where inmates have their infant children with them until they are a year old. The project usually spans three sessions: one for drafting lullabies, one for recording them in a professional studio and a third session to share the songs with the group.

The Lullaby Project mothers each have their own struggles, but they are also simply new mothers. Of all the faulty universals out there, that of being a new mother — with all the physical sameness that generally entails — is one of the most illuminating, one of the least wrong. When the Lullaby Project hosted a free public concert of four created lullabies in Portland, more than 350 people attended.

One of the oldest known lullabies is a 5,000-year-old Babylonian song. Its lyrics seem to come to us from around the corner. The words, as translated by the archaeomusicologist Richard Dumbrill, are:

Little baby in the dark house,

You have seen the sun rise.

Why are you crying?

Why are you screaming?

You have disturbed the house god. Who has disturbed me? says the house god.

It is the baby who has disturbed you.

Who scared me? says the house god.

The baby has disturbed you, the baby has scared you.

Making noises like a drunkard who cannot sit still on his stool.

He has disturbed your sleep. Call the baby now, says the house god.

What I love about this lullaby is that the baby scares and rivals the god. Both are trying to sleep; both have been disturbed; both have been frightened. This parallelism makes it seem as if they are one and the same: The baby is the house god, the house god is the baby. We, as singers of the song, seem ambivalent about the god’s powers, about the baby’s powers. In the lyrics, we point blame at the baby, but by singing at all, we are appeasing the baby, obeying its cries.

What, really, is a lullaby? We can define it functionally — a song used to lull a child to sleep. In this sense, the distinctive burden of a lullaby is to be interesting enough to capture a child’s attention, but not interesting enough to keep the child awake, which is perhaps why most of the songs we think of as lullabies have a 6/8 meter and are confined to about five notes. Studies on babies in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) show that premature infants prefer lullabylike songs to other music — their heart rates and breathing steady, their feeding patterns improve and they are more likely, when hearing lullabies regularly over time, to gain the weight they need. It has even been shown that preemies in NICUs who have lullabies sung to them during venipuncture sessions have significantly lower pain scores following the prick. Babies seem to recognize the voices of their parents more readily than anyone else's. The maternal voice in particular, which a fetus begins to hear around 25 weeks into a pregnancy, is uniquely comforting.

The effects of lullabies on the bond between mother and child, and on feelings of well-being in both, may be more difficult to quantify than respiratory rate or weight gain — so many important things are difficult to name, much less quantify — but they seem just as fundamental. At a recent session, 10 mothers and a mother to be were gathered, along with Cabaniss and six other Carnegie musicians, in the sunny den room of Siena House, a shelter in the Bronx for homeless mothers. Most of the mothers’ babies were present, some just a few weeks old. The babies were resting in portable car seats or nestled in their mothers’ arms. On the floor, a toddler boy held a Casio keyboard on his lap; a little girl held a toy boombox.

The room felt almost too convivial for anything as elusive and dreamy as a lullaby to show up. Then Cabaniss plucked a note on his mbira (a board instrument that is sometimes called a thumb piano), and the room sang the note together. Then everyone sang two shifting notes, before returning to a single note. The communal singing at first felt quite awkward, then pretty normal, then oddly powerful, and by the end of the collective hum, I don’t think I was the only person in the room who had that ‘‘aligned’’ feeling I more commonly associate with having my shoulders rubbed or hearing Ravel’s ‘‘Boléro.’’ Afterward, there was a curious absence of any fussing sounds from the babies.

I have yet to be told of a baby who does not have what seems to the average adult an extravagant and almost unnatural sensitivity to music. (‘‘He was just crying and crying, and I felt desperate, and then, I swear to you, I put on Ornette Coleman/Rihanna/Pandora/bluegrass/whatever, and he/she became calm/quiet/happy/rapt.’’ I have heard this, and probably said this, in countless Mad Libs variations.) But for that baby, it’s never just any music; it’s specific sounds. For example, one of the assorted humblings of becoming a parent is discovering which songs you actually know the words to. When I had a newborn I found that the main song that came to me, unbidden, was ‘‘Cotton Fields,’’ as sung by Creedence Clearwater Revival — a song I hadn’t heard for years and years. I like that song well enough, and I knew it as a child, but I did feel a little bit self-conscious hearing myself, a Jewish girl from Oklahoma, singing a remake of a Lead Belly version of a tune whose lyrics suggest it may have been a slave song to my distinctly fortunate baby. But if I tried to switch songs on her, she would immediately cry. She had chosen her lullaby.

Most parents find themselves singing whatever song happens to come to them; the songs are not deliberately chosen, which may be why many of the women at Siena House that afternoon felt blocked as they tried to write lullabies. One mother, Juanita, who had joined the group late, was almost too overwhelmed with new-mother emotion to come up with any words. ‘‘I don’t know anything about music,’’ she kept saying. Her baby was less than two months old, and though her friend kept offering to take him, she insisted on holding him. Cabaniss came around to try to be of help putting the song together. Juanita said, ‘‘All I can think to say is ‘God gave me an angel.’ You don’t understand, but this baby is a miracle baby.’’ Juanita explained the particular physical difficulties of her pregnancy. ‘‘I’ve got nothing for the song,’’ she said. ‘‘But I want to try.’’ She and Cabaniss eventually put together a simple four-line song, with the fourth line a repetition of the third: ‘‘God gave me an angel/He gave me you for a reason/You changed my life/You changed my life.’’ The tune was simple and clear.

Since childhood I’ve felt anxious about singing any song with the word ‘‘God’’ in it. Unless I was attending a friend’s church, I never sang it — and even then, I would mumble. Call it innate superstition. Or not wanting to disturb the house gods. I wouldn’t even sing ‘‘He’s Got the Whole World in His Hands.’’ And yet: After that first lullaby session, and for weeks afterward, I found, in idle moments, that I was humming Juanita’s lullaby. Which has now entered the limited canon of songs my child finds acceptable.

The lullaby my father sang most often to me was ‘‘Goodnight, Irene.’’ He would sing the chorus, but then he didn’t quite know the verse, it seemed to me, because the rhyme scheme was off. (‘‘Sometimes I live in the city, sometimes I live in the country,’’ he would sing, and then he would repeat the chorus.) I can remember well his tuneless voice — part of what is so moving to me about lullabies is that they are usually sung by people who ‘‘can’t sing’’ — and I remember that sometimes I would just pretend to be asleep, because I would feel guilty, knowing that I wasn’t anywhere near asleep, and that he was trying to help me.

Only when I was a teenager did I hear a recorded version of ‘‘Goodnight, Irene.’’ It was sung by Nat King Cole, and the chorus was as I remembered it, but the verses were different. And yet I recognized which verse my father was singing inaccurately: ‘‘Sometimes I live in the country/Sometimes I live in town/Sometimes I have a great notion/To jump in the river and drown.’’ I don’t think my father was regularly thinking about jumping in a river and drowning. I also don’t think he was consciously bowdlerizing the song to make it more ‘‘appropriate’’ for me. Now that I’m older, I suspect that while singing a lullaby to me he must also have sometimes been singing to himself, or daydreaming, or playing over the day in his mind, or replaying an argument from work. Occasionally, singing must have even functioned as a kind of whistling in the dark for him, for whatever it was that had been worrying him. And in that sense, the hidden darkness of the song, which a part of him must have registered, probably helped him, the way that speaking a dark feeling can. A couple of times I have sung ‘‘Goodnight, Irene’’ to my daughter, and first her lip quivered and then she began to sob. I have often thought that lullabies, whatever their words, mostly just communicate ‘‘I love you.’’ But after my attempts at ‘‘Goodnight, Irene,’’ I started to think that no matter what we try to hide or show in a lullaby, other meanings make their own way through.

If the primary function of lullabies is to lull a baby to sleep, another function is to let the singer speak. Maybe this is one reason the lyrics of lullabies are often so unsettled and dark. One way a mother might bond with a newborn is by sharing her joy; another way is by sharing her grief or frustration. We see this in songs across time. A 200-year-old Arabic lullaby still sung today goes:

I am a stranger, and my neighbors are strangers;

I have no friends in this world.

Winter night and the husband is absent.

And an old Spanish lullaby from Asturias, written down by the poet Federico García Lorca, goes:

This little boy clinging so

Is from a lover, Vitorio,

May God, who gave, end my woe,

Take this Vitorio clinging so.

We assume the sound of these songs is sweet, as no lullaby endures without being effective at putting babies to sleep. Think of ‘‘Rock-a-bye Baby,’’ the way it tenderly describes an infant and its cradle falling to the ground: The singer gets to speak a fear, the baby gets to rest; the singer tries to accommodate herself to a possible loss that has for most of human history been rela­tively common, and the baby gets attentive care. In the Arabic and Spanish lullabies, the singers get to say something to the one being — their new burden, their new love — who can’t and won’t judge or discipline them for saying it. When even relatively happy, well-supported people become the primary caretaker of a very small person, they tend to find themselves eddied out from the world of adults. They are never alone — there is always that tiny person — and yet they are often lonely. Old songs let us feel the fellowship of these other people, across space and time, also holding babies in dark rooms. In 1928, when Lorca gave a lecture in Madrid about the Spanish lullabies he had for years been collecting, he spoke of a woman he had heard singing a sad lullaby, saying that ‘‘a living tradition worked in her, and she faithfully executed its commands, as though listening to the ancient, imperious voices echoing in her blood.’’ After hearing her sing, he said, he ‘‘tried to collect lullabies from every corner of Spain; wishing to know how my countrywomen lull their children to sleep, and after a while I gained the impression that Spain utilizes its saddest melodies and most melancholy texts to tinge her children’s first slumber.’’ He also noted that the woman he heard singing the sad song, upon approach, looked happy.

Most of the American lullabies that have come down to us through the years are also sad. The bough has broken; darling Clementine is lost; even my sunshine, my only sunshine, has, you will learn if you exit the chorus and enter the next verse, gone away. (My daughter sings ‘‘You Are My Sunshine’’ with the custom lyric ‘‘when skies are great,’’ and I can’t sing her the main verses without crying, and so naturally, I don’t sing them at all.) The sadness in those traditional songs, once noticed, is nearly unbearable, which may be why so many people just sing the choruses, leaving the main sentiment ‘‘forgotten.’’ Still, it can seem strange that these are the songs we have wanted, for so many years, to keep singing to one another. It’s almost as if the songs are trying to work some magic — as if by singing we're saying, Sadness has already touched this house, no need to come by again.

Almost all the songs written at the Siena House had the characteristic of benedictions; they were less wardings-off of evil than conjurings of good. This may have been in part because the mothers were in the unusually difficult situation of living in a shelter with a young child. Two of the women had partners who were in prison; almost all of them said their primary goal as mothers was that their babies’ childhoods not resemble their own. Music and parenting share a substructure of repetition with variation: Somehow we are at once unconsciously trying to re-enact our childhoods with our children and also trying to defeat them. None of the women remembered having songs sung to them.

For ‘‘The Man Who Knew Too Much,’’ Hitchcock could have chosen any existing song. Instead, he sought out an original one for the film, the still-famous ‘‘Que Sera, Sera.’’ The song is a curious choice. In the film, Day sings:

When I was just a little boy

I asked my mother, What will I be?

Will I be handsome?

Will I be rich?

Here’s what she said to me. Que sera, sera

Whatever will be, will be.

The future’s not ours to see.

Que sera, sera.

What will be, will be.

Is the song telling the child that he has no control over his fate? Or is it simply saying that he can’t know for sure, that wondering is of no use? The catchy tune is cheerful and assuring, and never strays from an expected melody line — in keeping with the bright fatalism of the lyrics. But the fatalist streak puts the song in tension with the film’s plot, since the plot is full of decisions that feel as if they will affect the family’s future, maybe catastrophically. In trying to protect their child from the murder scene in the market and the ensuing police inquiry, the McKennas unwittingly hand him over to the kidnappers; then they have to decide whether to heed the captors’ insistence that they tell no one and whether to work with Scotland Yard. They have the power to make decisions, but it’s a maddeningly minor power. Things turn out O.K., repeatedly, but only through a shift of milli­meters, though a nudging of luck.

Public-health efforts aimed at infants also have to accommodate some fatalism into their outlooks. Lives are improved a little bit here, a little bit there, sometimes predictably, sometimes less so. Each family finds themselves in a set of norms, like the McKennas do. All new human beings arrive vulnerable to circumstances over which they had no influence, but which, in turn, have enormous influence on them. To try to help infants is to try to push norms in directions that seem promising.

All the mothers I met through the Lullaby Project mentioned that they spoke often to their children, to expose them to as many words as possible — a clear response to the public-health campaign around the importance of babies’ and young children’s hearing a large number of words. Lullabies also slow down language, and in doing so probably make it easier for a baby to follow. The director of the Institute for Neuro-Physiological Pyschology in England, Sally Goddard Blythe, tells a story of how one of her sons, who had a hearing problem diagnosed at 18 months and who went on to have troubles with reading and speaking at school, showed rapid improvement after he joined a cathedral choir when he was 8. The head of the choir told Blythe that he often saw swift language advancement in children after they joined the choir. ‘‘Research on lullabies is harder, but there is plenty of research of the effects of music on reading and maths,’’ Blythe notes. Music is above all a good in and of itself, but studies suggest that sustained musical training develops skills essential to reading, spatial reasoning and, to some extent, the learning of secondary languages.

Much of the value of lullabies is most likely private, as the singing itself is. (When do most adults sing? Almost never, save maybe at a church service, or alone, alongside a pop tune.) Martha Kempe, who helps facilitate participation in a Lullaby Project in Maine, explains: ‘‘To try and teach directly about an abstract thing like bonding — well, that doesn’t always really work, to just talk about it. This is a way to learn about bonding that isn’t abstract.’’

There was a certain ultraviolet feeling that accompanied my observing women in the Lullaby Project — women I didn’t know — as they put together words for their babies. After all, lullabies are like secrets. To hear one not directed at you, and not sung by you, is like listening in on a daydream. A YouTube post of an elephant caretaker singing the elephant Faa Mai to sleep at the Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand, has more than 2.5 million viewings.

On the song-sharing afternoon at Siena House, the mothers listened to a Spanish song by a mother named Charlenys, who had written about waiting for morning with her baby, who had gastric reflux and was often up much of the night. After the song was played, a Hispanic mother who had participated in the project a year earlier described how she connected with the song. Then she addressed Charlenys directly, in Spanish. But before she made it through her first sentence, she began to cry. Music is so often a shortcut through time, making old emotions quickly present again. The words may or may not be specifically evocative on their own, however sincere. But then, when a parent sings to the small semi-stranger whom she loves, the emotion somehow comes through.

The evening after the first lullaby session, back when my child used only about five words, one of the most common ones was ‘‘More?’’ — always with that question mark, her inflection already lilting up like that of the normals, the adult women, around her. If I were to estimate, I would say that 87 percent of the time what she wanted more of was milk, though she couldn’t yet verbally specify. But one evening, after I had given her milk, and sung her this and that, and stroked her forehead, and then sat there waiting with all the tension of the end of a Dickens chapter for her to fall asleep — I was desperate for a space of time without her, even though I loved her — she said, More? And then, again, More? But she refused milk. Eventually, maybe with some frustration, and somewhat foolishly, considering that she knew almost no words, I asked her: ‘‘More what? More of what?’’ And then, I swear to you, for the first time ever, she put two words together: “More song?”",REAL
Do Politicians’ ‘Thoughts and Prayers’ Mean Anything?,"It is a bit of a stretch — if not highly dubious — to suggest that sending ‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ amounts to ‘‘reflection’’ of any sort, appropriate or otherwise. But as with many shared media spectacles, Twitter makes it easy. ‘‘My thoughts and prayers are with all impacted by the Oregon shooting,’’ Chelsea Clinton tweeted the day after the president’s ‘‘thoughts and prayers are not enough’’ declaration (earning a special demerit for using ‘‘impact’’ as a verb). This came two days before she would again be tweeting that her ‘‘thoughts and prayers tonight are with all in South Carolina’’ as heavy rains swamped the state. (As a general rule, early-­primary states receive a disproportionate amount of thoughts and prayers.) I shouldn’t pick on Clinton, though; she is very much a product of the easy-­connection ethos that was associated with — and to some degree perfected by — her father. Bill Clinton had a great knack for using his presidency as a mass empathy pulpit. He pioneered a language of cheap consolation (‘‘I feel your pain’’) that would later be supercharged by the social-­media tools that democratized the exercise of sending out thoughtful and prayerful wishes. The reflexive act is a little like flipping light switches that don’t do anything. Sometimes, for some reason, you are moved to push them up and down as you walk by. You don’t think about it, and nothing happens, but maybe you feel you’ve done something.

People were not always so generous with their thoughts and prayers. A contributor to Wordwizard, an online discussion group on language and usage, traced a building evolution of the phrase to the 19th century. There were scattered invocations of the phrase in the 1800s — including one attributed to Queen Victoria, as she addressed the Grenadier Guards before they headed off to Egypt (‘‘My thoughts and prayers go with you,’’ declared her majesty). But thoughts and prayers were not often joined in public utterance until well into the 20th cen­tury. ‘‘My thoughts and prayers are with the delegates of my governments who are gathered in conference today,’’ King George said in a message to the Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa, according to a New York Times account from 1932. ‘‘Our thoughts and prayers are with our young men who are fighting in Korea,’’ President Harry Truman said in a speech in 1950, while former President Dwight Eisenhower said ‘‘our thoughts and prayers are with them’’ after the deaths of three Apollo astronauts at Cape Canaveral in 1967. Gov. Ronald Reagan of California sent a handwritten condolence note to ‘‘Mrs. Robt. Kennedy,’’ reassuring her that ‘‘our thoughts and prayers are with you’’ after her husband was assassinated in Los Angeles.

The term’s saturation curve dates to the turn of the 21st century. Numerous ‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ pronouncements followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, both in public statements and in paid advertisements. ‘‘Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with those who have suffered the devastating loss of a loved one,’’ read a display ad from Morgan Stanley that appeared in The New York Times. Two years later, in the midst of the battle over the life of Terri Schiavo, the Florida patient and cause célèbre, Gov. Jeb Bush declared, ‘‘My thoughts and prayers remain with Terri and those who love her.’’ After Dick Cheney accidentally shot his hunting buddy, Harry Whittington, in 2006, the vice president mostly refrained from public comment, except to state that his ‘‘thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittington and his family.’’

It’s hard to settle on why ‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ is objectionable. Maybe it’s just the aggressive passivity of the phrase. I’ve seen it included on compilations of ‘‘things not to say’’ that people enduring difficult times sometimes assemble. In an article about his battle with cancer in his This Life column for The Times, the author and social commentator Bruce Feiler listed ‘‘My thoughts and prayers are with you’’ as a big no-no. ‘‘In my experience, some people think about you, which is nice,’’ Feiler wrote. ‘‘Others pray for you, which is equally comforting. But the majority of people who say they’re sending ‘thoughts and prayers’ are just falling back on a mindless cliché.’’

To send ‘‘thoughts’’ would seem to be a deadened way of saying ‘‘I’ve been, or will be, thinking about you’’ (which would sound nicer), just as a generic announcement of ‘‘prayers’’ is a neutered version of ‘‘I’m praying for you.’’ After the mass shooting this summer that killed nine in a church in Charleston, S.C., Lindsey Graham gave a statement that, by enlivening the words and adding heart, made all the difference. ‘‘To the families of the victims, please know that you are being prayed for and loved by so many in the community and across the nation. I pray that God will provide you healing in the coming days.’’

When I discussed ‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ with astute media consumers, it elicited smirks and sneers. ‘‘It takes a couple of traditional pieties — ‘in our thoughts’ and ‘in our prayers’ — and combines them to somehow make the underlying sentiments even emptier, along Hallmark lines,’’ said Bob Garfield, a co-host of WNYC’s ‘‘On the Media’’ and the Slate podcast about language called ‘‘Lexicon Valley.’’ ‘‘When uttered by civilians, it’s mechanical enough,’’ Garfield said. ‘‘When uttered by elected officials, it has all the emotional resonance of a Miranda warning.’’

Herewith, then, a simple, practical adaptation of Miranda: You have a right to your thoughts and prayers — and to remain silent about them.",REAL
How Do I Handle a Claim of Sexual Assault by a Close Friend?,"Whether this should be brought before the authorities, however, is fundamentally her choice to make. It’s her story. She’s the one who would have to face the burden of testifying, the public exposure of her life and all the other consequences. I’m not even sure that the person who told you about this should have told you; it depends on what the victim’s expectations were. Gossip about sexual assaults — as opposed to serious discussion of what to do about them — can be one of the harms that surround them.

Because you’re not close to the victim, you’re not in a good position to help her think about her decisions. (If you were, you might ask her to consider whether she should do something about what happened to prevent it from happening to someone else.) But you are in a good position to talk to your friend who, it seems, carried out the assault. It sounds as if you’ve discussed difficult issues with him before. That’s a good basis for trying this one. You can help him think it through responsibly. Because, as you say, alcohol was involved, he might not be aware of how awful the episode was for the woman involved; he may not take it seriously enough.

You could help him see that what he did was wrong; and probably, if your other friend’s account is correct, criminal. You could also help him decide what he should do about it. Here we enter very difficult territory. I’ve explained why you shouldn’t file a report. Might the same considerations apply to him? (Not that it’s likely he would want to, were you to propose it.) Mightn’t it seem to her like a noxious power move to go to the authorities without consulting her first? And can he consult her without imposing himself on a woman who has every reason to want never to see him again?

On the other hand, a straightforward letter expressing deep remorse for what he did might be welcome. And maybe the woman who knows you both can help figure out if it would be. (Of course, your friend might balk at the legal risk.) It’s a hard call. The main point is that the victim here has the right to control the agenda.

You could help him, meanwhile, to make sure he never does anything like this again. That’s especially important, because this is, you say, the extreme end of a spectrum of troubling behavior.

There are, in other words, forward-looking and backward-looking concerns: the challenge of facing up to a past wrong and the challenge of making sure he doesn’t repeat it. Both are morally important. Don’t be surprised, however, if he doesn’t welcome your intervention. And, if he doesn’t, then without the consent of the victim, there’s not much else you can do, except, of course, decide to keep him out of your life.

Recently, a close family friend revealed to many of her friends and family that she caught her husband cheating. She also revealed that she caught him last year and at least once before, many years ago, early on in their marriage. She also informed us that against the repeated and explicit wishes of her friends and family, she is going to remain married, as they have small children together. Before these unfortunate events, she was notorious for incessantly updating her social-media accounts with pictures of her children and her family, with captions painting a portrait of how wonderful their lives were together.

Since these events, her online updates of this nature seem to have increased. It looks like an unconscious attempt to convince both the world and herself that all is well. Do I have an ethical obligation to inform her of how her behavior is perceived by myself and others, either to spare her from embarrassment or alert her to our concern about her mental state? Is there anything to be said on the children’s behalf? She is immortalizing their lives on Facebook without their consent, and they may one day learn of these events and really come to dislike what is now permanently online. Name Withheld

Wait — there are people who parade an idealized version of their lives on social media? While I’m processing this, let’s take up the question of who is responsible for what in actual life. You say that your friend has declined to get divorced ‘‘against the repeated and explicit wishes of her friends and family.’’ Once you’ve delivered your advice, though, what you all wish for is neither here nor there. What matters is what’s good for her, her children, maybe even her straying husband. It’s her marriage, her life. For better or worse, she’s in charge.

Back in the digital realm, meanwhile, wouldn’t your judgment against parents who post pictures of their little kids ‘‘without their consent’’ apply to most parents on Facebook? You may think she should represent her life with spare and somber realism and have the decency to use the Diane Arbus filter on her Instagram pics. She may find comfort in curating the high points of her days. And, because some self-prettification is the Facebook norm, you don’t really want to jump on people who do the normal amount of it. I guess she would be exceeding any reasonable interpretation of the norm if people who learned of her difficulties were justified in feeling seriously deceived. I’m not sure, from what you say, if that’s the case here.

The main problem with her social-­media strategy — assuming you and your friends are typical — is that it isn’t working. What should you do about this? Some people think ethics is all about duties. I don’t think we have a general moral obligation to tell people that they’re making asses of themselves. (In the age of social media, that could provide millions with a full-time job.) But ethics isn’t just about the stern strictures of duty. It is also about helping people you care about make better choices: being a good friend. And it’s about being considerate and helpful and honest: being a good person. You know this, because you’ve already offered her advice about her marriage. So go ahead and break the news to her gently. Just be sure that you’re motivated by kindness, not annoyance. They can sometimes be confused.

And maybe technology will come to the rescue. Facebook may soon get a Dislike button.",REAL
Memories of Things Unseen,"A few weeks ago, at an exhibition at the FotoMuseum in Antwerp, Belgium, I walked past a large color photograph of a forest. It was an exhibition about landscape in general, organized to give the visitor the feeling of a hike through mountainous terrain. The photograph of the forest was near the entrance of the exhibition, and I had walked past it without stopping because it seemed to be simply another big photo, of which there are so many in museums these days. But after going through the exhibition, I decided to double back. This time around, I took a good look at the large photograph, which was more than 16 feet wide, and found that there was more to it than size. The leaves were odd, simplified. I read the caption. What the photograph (titled ‘‘Clearing’’) showed was not a forest, but a model of a forest. The German artist Thomas Demand had constructed this model from paper and set it in a steel frame 50 feet wide. Two hundred and seventy thousand leaves had been individually cut. The model was illuminated by a powerful lamp, to mimic shafts of sunlight falling through the trees.

The immense labor involved in creating ‘‘Clearing’’ was part of what made it now interesting to me. But more eerie was the knowledge that Demand had destroyed the model. All that remained was the photo. It was orphaned from its source, and that source would be remembered by only this one angle, this single point of view, under precisely these lighting conditions. The photograph gave us a memory of something we had never seen. Demand had done this intentionally, but ‘‘Clearing’’ reminded me of other photographs that were inadvertent records of artworks subsequently lost to war or fire. This was the fate, for instance, of Vincent van Gogh’s ‘‘The Painter on the Road to Tarascon’’ (1888), which was believed to have been lost to Allied attacks on Magdeburg in 1945, late in the Second World War, and Gustave Courbet’s ‘‘The Stone Breakers’’ (1849), which was incinerated during the firebombing of Dresden the same year. Each now exists only as a photograph.

Photography is inescapably a memorial art. It selects, out of the flow of time, a moment to be preserved, with the moments before and after falling away like sheer cliffs. At a dinner party earlier this year, I was in conversation with someone who asked me to define photography. I suggested that it is about retention: not only the ability to make an image directly out of the interaction between light and the tangible world, but also the possibility of saving that image. A shadow thrown onto a wall is not photography. But if the wall is photo­sensitive and the shadow remains after the body has moved on, that is photography. Human creativity, since the beginning of art, has found ways to double the visible world. What photography did was to give the world a way to double its own appearance: The photograph results directly from what is, from the light that travels from a body through an aperture onto a surface.

But when the photograph outlives the body — when people die, scenes change, trees grow or are chopped down — it becomes a memorial. And when the thing photographed is a work of art or architecture that has been destroyed, this effect is amplified even further. A painting, sculpture or temple, as a record of both human skill and emotion, is already a site of memory; when its only remaining trace is a photograph, that photograph becomes a memorial to a memory. Such a photograph is shadowed by its vanished ancestor.

I visited the Metropolitan Museum in early August this year, at a time when the destruction of artifacts in Iraq and Syria was prominent in the news, to look at the museum’s collection of works from the ancient Middle East. Next to a selection of second-and-third-century Syrian gravestones (many of them fresh with the pain of loss and inscribed with the names of the dead and the word ‘‘Alas!’’), there was an old photograph reproduced from a book of the Temple of Bel, an important archaeological complex in Palmyra. About a week later, the iconoclastic fanatics of ISIS blew up this very temple. The photograph was unchanged; it was still there on the wall of Room 406 at the Met, but it was now filled up with the loss of what it depicted. The Roman-era columns of the temple still stand in rows in the grainy image — ravaged by time, but standing. In life, they’re gone.

The Institute for Digital Archaeology, a joint project of Harvard and Oxford Universities, uses sophisticated imaging techniques to aid conservation, epigraphy, archaeology and art history. One of the institute’s current efforts, the Million Image Database Project, involves photographing artifacts that are at risk of being destroyed for military or religious reasons, a bleak necessity in a world in which the beauty or importance of an object does not guarantee its safety. The goal of the project is to distribute up to 5,000 modified cameras, to professionals and to amateurs, and use them to capture a million 3-D images by the end of 2015. Already, more than a thousand cameras have been distributed, and the 3-D data from them are being received (though the directors of the project, to protect their associates on the ground, are leaving a lag of several months before they make the images publicly available). In the event of some of the objects being destroyed, the detailed visual record could be enough to facilitate a reconstruction. Photography is used to ward off total oblivion, the way that the photographs of Courbet’s ‘‘The Stone Breakers’’ and van Gogh’s ‘‘The Painter on the Road to Tarascon’’ accidentally made the lost paintings visible to future generations.

But memory has a menacing side. Our own appearances and faces are now stored and saved in hundreds, thousands, of photographs: photographs made by ourselves, photographs made by others. Our faces are becoming not only unforgettable but inescapable. There is so much documentation of each life, each scene and event, that the effect of this incessant visual notation becomes difficult to distinguish from surveillance. And in fact, much of the intent behind the collection of these images is indeed surveillance: The government retains our images in order to fight terrorism, and corporations harvest everything they can about us in order to sell us things.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Mack’s Earplugs,"Photo

I’m resigned to the fact that there will forever exist some unremarkable sensory experiences that nevertheless overwhelm me: the smell of Coca-Cola, a wet straw wrapper on a diner counter, live music in any place at all. These processing difficulties compound with the pace of technology and city life — phone-screen brightness upon headphone static upon subway-car jostling upon the chatter between my own ears. Taking it all in feels unwieldy, so I search out ways to take in just some of it.

Mack’s Soft Foam Earplugs are the filter for modernity that only an earlier version of modernity could have produced. Manufactured from emphatically unnatural urethane foam, this hearing-protection aid has little in common with contemporary fair-trade-and-high-fiber solutions for modern life, and instead embodies all the qualities of a turn-of-the-century novelty like the Tootsie Roll: uncomplicated, compulsively artificial, on sale for only a few cents. Available in a range of penny-candy colors, a plastic jar of 50 pairs of earplugs costs less than $9, so I indulge freely in the thoroughly modern luxury of surplus. You can keep your headphones and earbuds; I scatter these neon nubs in my desk drawers and tote bags to enjoy the relief of silence on demand.

To use Mack’s Soft Foam Earplugs, you roll them like boogers between your thumb and forefinger and stuff them in your ears. As the foam expands, creating a seal between your brain and the world, you’ll experience the sensation of falling into a dreamland, where everything is the same as before except thrillingly dampened. Stock up on reading material and philosophical concerns, for the world is your sanctuary now. Con­sider the fleetingness of existence while you treat Times Square like your living room. Unpack Judith Butler in a crowded bar. With an earful of foam, rush hours become office hours, but quieter still.

What? The National Institutes of Health says that prolonged exposure to noise at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss. For those unfamiliar with decibel levels, the N.I.H. offers this handy conversion chart: • 0-30db: Whispering • 40-75db: Dishwasher • 85db: City traffic • 90db: Lawn mower • 95db: Motorcycle • 100db: Power tools • 105db: Personal stereo at maximum volume • 110db: Concert speakers • 120db: Ambulance siren • 140db: Jet engine • 150db: Shotgun

I first came to earplugs as a poseur in a punk scene in suburban Pennsylvania. I didn’t care for live music even then, but I’ve always appreciated a cul­­ti­vated tough-guy facade, and so I aspired to be like the bad boy in the mosh pit with the earplugs. To wear earplugs at the Y.M.C.A. teen center in Doylestown, Pa., was to suggest you went so hard, at so many shows, that your reckless lifestyle demanded some small nod to caution, lest you flame out too soon from tinnitus. I don’t go to punk shows anymore, but I arguably go hard in the pit of life, and so I still carry earplugs wherever I go.

If anything, it should be regarded as a power move to hack apart reality and reassemble the experience according to your own terms.",REAL
Curry for Comfort,"Photo

Meera Sodha was 18, at college and eating with friends at a curry house in London, one of the dozens that crowd Brick Lane in the city’s East End. She had grown up in Lincolnshire, three hours to the north, the daughter of Indians who came to Britain from Uganda in 1972, when Idi Amin ordered all Asians to leave his nation or be killed. The food she grew up eating, she told me a few weeks ago, was fresh and simple, Indian food of the sort that her ancestors cooked for hundreds of years.

Sodha is now 33. But recalling that evening in Brick Lane still causes her voice to rise a little in indignation. The food that was in front of her was a far distance from fresh and simple. ‘‘It was awful,’’ she said. ‘‘It was baby food. My brown face went ashen.’’

She went home and called her mother, asked for some recipes and started to cook. And she kept cooking, looking over the shoulders of relatives, recording for the first time recipes that had been passed down only as stories, woman to woman, for generations.

It took more than a decade to assemble, but Sodha’s ‘‘Made in India: Recipes From an Indian Family Kitchen’’ was published in Britain last year, where it sold very well. Just released in the United States, it offers a terrific introduction to the world of Sodha’s past and present cooking: dead-simple family food absolutely packed with flavor.

Photo

Take as an example the simple chicken curry that Sodha’s mother made in Lincolnshire, her ‘‘ultimate comfort food,’’ in Sodha’s words. It is marvelous accompanied by her aunt Harsha’s naan, a soft and pillowy flatbread that is the curry’s natural and best companion, with or without a mound of basmati rice on the side. The recipes are unpretentious and were immediately promoted by my family of critics into must-makes for the monthly dinner rotation, new staples for a season of chill and damp.

That very much includes the naan. It takes but a few minutes to assemble the dough, which rises unattended in about an hour, or a little more in drafty Northeastern kitchens. And the business of cutting it and rolling out rounds of bread afterward, then cooking the things one by one in a hot skillet, is light work after the very first naan is complete — assembly-line cooking of the very best sort. The result is crackly on the outside, singed by the heat, yielding to tenderness within, with a faint tang of yogurt, exactly the sort of thing you’d love to dip in a pool of curry again and again. Make the recipe two or three times, and you’ll never buy naan again.",REAL
One Suicide (Assisted) Almost Becomes Two,"For me, it has always been clear: Life is worth it only if you want it. And my mom didn’t. So I started talking to her. I wanted to lead my mom from her belief that suicide is a sin to my own view: that suicide is a sovereign right every person has. But for my mom, religion was company, comfort. It would be wrong of me to try to convince her of something different. So I was just trying to lead her to the notion of a compassionate God, a merciful one.

One day, when I opened the door, I heard her crying, alone, in her bed. I went to her, and she told me, sobbing: ‘‘No, this blindness. ... I don’t want to continue living like this.’’ So I said: ‘‘Tell me what you want. I’ll do anything.’’ Then she said, ‘‘Get whatever you need.’’

She went to pray. I saw her kneeling by the bed, and I knew it was time. After she came back, we hugged, we cried for a bit.

She went with me to the kitchen, and I prepared the cocktail in the blender, mixing the sleeping pills and morphine with yogurt in a mug I still have.

We went to the bedroom. She smoked a cigarette and asked me to keep my brother company. She told me what clothes she wanted for her wake, and that she wanted a lot of people at her funeral. She was calm. She finished her cigarette and drank the potion. Within 10 minutes she was deeply asleep. She started to breathe very heavily with some snoring, and then, at one point, it just ended. I knew that she had jumped the wall.

Now it was my turn. I’d decided that I’d take the cocktail, too. She had no idea. She wouldn’t have allowed it. But my mother had become my reason for living, and I couldn’t imagine her absence. I wasn’t willing to endure that loneliness. Everything pointed toward an end.

I was with her for an hour or so, whispering things to her ear. I wrote my brother a letter, I listened to music, I went for a walk. Then I prepared the cocktail.

I adjusted a plastic bag on my forehead with some rubber bands. If you want to be certain it’s going to work, you count two minutes after taking the medicine and then pull down the bag. So you fall asleep, and then the asphyxia comes. You aren’t conscious anymore.

I wore the plastic bag as a hat and went straight to bed. I hugged my mom, thinking I was going to lie face up and then pull down the bag. But no. I hugged her, and that was it. I collapsed.

My brother found us the next day. Three days later I woke up in the hospital. My mom was already buried. And there were homicide charges. That same night they transferred me to jail.

I had really tough days there, but I was satisfied that my mom was at rest. My brother sent me a letter in jail, telling me that he would never abandon me, that he was there for me. After the shock had faded, he agreed it was for the best. He told me, ‘‘I am so glad the old lady is at peace.’’

I was in jail for five months. Finally the judge determined that what happened was an assisted suicide, not a homicide; but for me to be charged for that in Colombia, my brother would have to press charges, and because he wouldn’t do it, the case was dropped.

Tammy Baldwin Has One Thing in Common With Trump,"Photo

You’re currently stumping for Hillary Clinton in Iowa: the first openly gay senator campaigning in the middle of the American heartland for the woman who could be the first female president. Do you think that the Midwest sometimes moves more quickly than the rest of the country on progressive issues? Absolutely. Wisconsin was the first state to enact a gay civil rights law, in 1982, offering protections against discrimination in employment, public accommodations and education. It was signed into law by a Republican governor, believe it or not.

Why do you think the heartland has this political tradition? We honor a hard week’s work, you know, and that’s how you’ll be judged.

You have said there’s less ego when female lawmakers get together than in mixed company. Is that simply because they’re women? Or is it because of the kind of women who wind up in Congress? A little of both. When I think of the personal narratives of my colleagues, many of them came to public life to fix something that was of great concern to them personally, or to their immediate family or community. For them, it wasn’t about ego to begin with.

Much of the modern history of the L.G.B.T. civil rights movement has coincided with your time in Congress. Have you seen any legislators change their minds on gay rights issues? In the House, I did a lot of sitting down with Republicans to talk about these bills. Often there was a real sort of intimacy in those conversations. People talked about gay brothers, or a child who was gay, lesbian or transgender. I can’t tell you how many of those stories I accumulated. I think I moved a number of my colleagues, and I think it at least caused a lot of internal conflict for those I didn’t move.",REAL

How to Find Truffles,"Photo

‘‘Hunt at night,’’ Matteo Gatti says. During white truffle season (mid-September through December), Gatti and his fungus-sniffing dogs walk the Italian countryside from midnight until morning, seven days a week. In the daytime, other truffle hunters crowd the landscape crying, ‘‘Cerca, cerca!’’ (‘‘search’’) to their excitable dog packs. ‘‘When the sun is out, there are too many other smells in the forest,’’ says Gatti, 44. Always wear a headlamp and attach LED lights to your dogs’ collars — ‘‘that way you can see where the dog goes when he is deep in the bushes.’’

Don’t leave the digging to your dog; even a trained one will mar the delicate lumps. Once a dog indicates it has detected the earthy funk of a mature truffle, use the small, trowel-like tool that Italians call a vanghetto to unearth it. The first truffles to mature — at which point their scent becomes detectable by dogs — will be near the surface, but as winter progresses you will need to dig deeper to find ripe specimens.

On a good night, Gatti might find $5,000 worth of the mottled, cream-colored fungi, which are prized for their rich flavor and scarcity. Unless you plan to eat them all yourself, sell your truffles immediately. Once disinterred, they rapidly lose water weight. In Italy, brokers are currently paying about $185 to $195 an ounce for the highest-quality finds. Last year, Gatti dug up a 4.16-pound white truffle near his home in Umbria that later sold at Sotheby’s for $61,250. But don’t do this for the money. ‘‘The truffle is a passion,’’ Gatti says, ‘‘and you need that passion to find them.’’

If the sun comes up and you’re empty-handed, or if you find yourself exhausted after months of graveyard-shift hours, remember that at least you have a dog to work with. Men like Gatti’s grandfather relied on the snouts of unruly and insubordinate hogs. ‘‘Pigs just want to eat the truffles,’’ Gatti says. ‘‘Dogs are much easier to work with.’’ He owns six lagotto romagnolos, the preferred canine breed for the job. ‘‘If you are just starting out, get an expert dog,’’ he says. ‘‘A dog can teach its owner to find truffles.’’",REAL

RE: TRUMP

Mark Leibovich profiled Donald Trump, the presidential hopeful whom the mainstream media refused to take seriously until he ­started dominating polls.

The Democratic National Committee should name a room after Donald Trump, who probably has no chance of winning the presidency but has been effective in convincing the American people that his fellow Republican contenders also have no chance. Trump’s observations about his opponents have turned former front-­runners into former candidates, and his commentaries have created lasting damage to their reputations. Because the American people can’t vote for ‘‘none of the above,’’ Trump is the next-best thing. Paul Feiner, Greenburgh, N.Y.

Donald Trump stands for hatred of the worst kind. I choose to believe that America is a nation that has been fighting for tolerance and, hopefully, kindness toward every person in this world. This country was built on ‘‘pulling yourself up’’ from whatever circumstances you happened to be born into. I choose to believe in an America that can appreciate plain common sense in this erratic world we all struggle to live in. Sharon Emes, Benicia, Calif.

Every person who has ever put fingers to keyboard has a take on what Donald Trump’s rise in the 2016 presidential race means. (I’ve had about four different ones.) But occasionally, out of this sea of takes emerges one that is both original and insightful.

Which brings me to Mark Leibovich’s profile of Trump in The New York Times Magazine. There’s a bunch of great stuff in there — including Leibovich’s admission that he was fearful of writing a big Trump article because he assumed the real estate magnate would flame out quickly. But one sentence really stood out to me as explaining something fundamental to Trump’s appeal. Here it is: ‘‘There is a certain prosperity-­­theology aspect to Trump’s appeal, the idea that you follow a minister because he is rich and has his own plane and implicitly and sometimes explicitly promises that you, too, will be rich.’’",REAL
The Year We Obsessed Over Identity,"What started this flux? For more than a decade, we’ve lived with personal technologies — video games and social-media platforms — that have helped us create alternate or auxiliary personae. We’ve also spent a dozen years in the daily grip of makeover shows, in which a team of experts transforms your personal style, your home, your body, your spouse. There are TV competitions for the best fashion design, body painting, drag queen. Some forms of cosmetic alteration have become perfectly normal, and there are shows for that, too. Our reinventions feel gleeful and liberating — and tied to an essentially American optimism. After centuries of women living alongside men, and of the races living adjacent to one another, even if only notionally, our rigidly enforced gender and racial lines are finally breaking down. There’s a sense of fluidity and permissiveness and a smashing of binaries. We’re all becoming one another. Well, we are. And we’re not.

In June, the story of a woman named Rachel Dolezal began its viral spread through the news. She had recently been appointed president of the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. in Spokane, Wash. She had been married to a black man, had two black sons and was, by most accounts, a black woman. Her white biological parents begged to differ. The ensuing scandal resurrected questions about the nature of identity — what compelled Dolezal to darken her skin, perm her hair and pass in reverse? She might not have been biologically black, but she seemed well past feeling spiritually white.

Some people called her ‘‘transracial.’’ Others found insult in her masquerade, particularly when the country’s attention was being drawn, day after day, to how dangerous it can be to have black skin. The identities of the black men and women killed by white police officers and civilians, under an assortment of violent circumstances, remain fixed.

But there was something oddly compelling about Dolezal, too. She represented — dementedly but also earnestly — a longing to transcend our historical past and racialized present. This is a country founded on independence and yet comfortable with racial domination, a country that has forever been trying to legislate the lines between whiteness and nonwhiteness, between borrowing and genocidal theft. We’ve wanted to think we’re better than a history we can’t seem to stop repeating. Dolezal’s unwavering certainty that she was black was a measure of how seriously she believed in integration: It was as if she had arrived in a future that hadn’t yet caught up to her.

It wasn’t so long ago that many Americans felt they were living in that future. Barack Obama’s election was the dynamite that broke open the country. It was a moment. It was the moment. Obama was biological proof of some kind of progress — the product of an interracial relationship, the kind that was outlawed in some states as recently as 1967 but was normalized. He seemed to absolve us of original sin and take us past this stupid, dangerous race stuff. What if suddenly anything was possible? What if we could be and do whatever and whoever we wanted? In that moment, the country was changing. We were changing.

Slide Show

Before Obama ran for president, when we tended to talk about racial identity, we did so as the defense of a settlement. Black was understood to be black, nontransferably. Negro intellectuals — Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray and James Baldwin, for starters — debated strategies for equality and tolerance. Some of them asserted that to be black was also to be American, even if America begged to differ. For most of those many decades, blackness stood in opposition to whiteness, which folded its arms and said that was black people’s problem. But Obama became everybody’s problem. He was black. He was white. He was hope. He was apocalypse. And he brought a lot of anxiety into weird relief. We had never really had a white president until we had a black one.

This radical hope, triggered by Obama, ushered in a period of bi- and transracial art — art that probed the possibility that we really had transcended race, but also ridiculed this hope with an acid humor. During Obama's past year in office, those works of art have taken on an even darker, more troubled tone as we keep looking around and seeing how little has really changed.

When the Dolezal story broke, I was partway through Nell Zink’s ‘‘Mislaid,’’ one of the four new satirical novels of race I read this year — Jess Row’s ‘‘Your Face in Mine,’’ Paul Beatty’s ‘‘The Sellout’’ and Mat Johnson’s ‘‘Loving Day’’ were the others. (I also read Fran Ross’s long-lost, recently reissued ‘‘Oreo.’’) But Zink’s was the only one that felt like an energy reading of Dolezal. Zink’s white heroine, Peggy, has run off with her daughter, Mireille, and decided to take the birth certificate of a dead black girl named Karen Brown and use it for Mireille, while changing her own name to Meg.

The next year, Karen was 4 years old going on 5 and still blond. Nonetheless registering her for first grade as a black 6-year-old was easy as pie. Maybe you have to be from the South to get your head around blond black people. Virginia was settled before slavery began, and it was diverse. There were tawny black people with hazel eyes. Black people with auburn hair, skin like butter and eyes of deep blue-green. Blond, blue-eyed black people resembling a recent chairman of the N.A.A.C.P.

Zink’s marveling description of what blackness looks like implies that it could welcome anyone. She draws a phenotypic loophole through which a sympathetic impostor or a straight-up cynic can pass.

Each of these books wrestles with the fact of race while trying to present it as mutable, constructed, obscuring. In Beatty’s novel, a young black farmer in modern Los Angeles reluctantly takes on a vulgar former TV minstrel star as his slave. Blackness, according to this book, is as much a scam as it is a cultural identity; the undercurrents of tragedy keep lapping at the harbor of farce. Row’s novel is also a satire, but an eerily calm one in which a white man has ‘‘racial reassignment’’ surgery and becomes black. Row, who like Zink is white, takes guilt to an astounding allegorical extreme: The surest cure for white oppression is to eliminate whiteness. Whatever else is going on with Dolezal psychologically, you can read into her proud reassignment a sense of shame.

But racial transgression works the other way too. ‘‘Hamilton’’ is a musical biography about the very white, very dead Alexander Hamilton, in which most of the cast is ‘‘other,’’ including Lin-Manuel Miranda, the show’s Nuyorican creator and star. Some of its audacity stems from the baldness of its political project: In changing the races of the founding fathers from white to brown, it pushes back against the currents of racial appropriation. It also infuses the traditional melodies of the American musical with so many genres of hip-hop and R & B, sometimes in a single number, that the songs themselves become something new. Political debates are staged as rap battles. Daveed Diggs’s Thomas Jefferson becomes the best good thing that never happened at the Source Awards. Artistically, Miranda has created a great night out. Racially, the show tags the entertainment industry status quo with color. It’s obviously musical theater. But damn if it’s not graffiti too.

Naturally, this new era has also agitated a segment of the populace that is determined to scrub the walls. That, presumably, is where Donald Trump comes in: as the presidential candidate for anyone freaked out by the idea of a show like ‘‘Hamilton.’’ Trump is the pathogenic version of Obama, filling his supporters with hope based on a promise to rid the country of change. This incarnation of Trump appeared not long after Obama’s election, determined to disprove the new president’s American citizenship. On Trump’s behalf, an entire wing of conservatism — the so-called birthers — devoted itself to the removal of a mask that Obama was never wearing. Part of Trump’s appeal is his illusion of authenticity. His blustering candor has currency in a landscape of android candidates. Yet his magnetism resides in paranoia, the fear that since Obama’s election ushered in this shifting, unstable climate of identity, the country has been falling apart.

It’s a paranoia that pop culture captured first: In the last six years, Hollywood has provided a glut of disaster spectacles, armageddon scenarios and White House sackings. But the USA Network’s ‘‘Mr. Robot,’’ which ended its first season last month, might have gotten at that sense of social collapse best. Created by Sam Esmail, an Egyptian-American, the show pits technology against the economy and its unstable protagonist against himself. The plot concerns a group of anarchist hackers conspiring to topple a corporation; with it go the stability of world markets and everybody’s financial debt. But it’s also a mystery about the identity of its protagonist, a mentally ill, morphine-addicted hacker named Elliot. We think he’s obeying the commands of the show’s title character, the head of a hacktivist outfit, but it turns out that he has been commanding himself all along. Significant parts of this world are figments of his delusion. Elliot is at least two people. Some of the dark excitement of this show is that he might be even more.

‘‘Mr. Robot’’ is worst-of-times TV, reflecting a mood of menacing instability. Over the course of its 10 episodes, almost no one was who they appeared to be. A straight married man seemed to think nothing of his sleeping with a gay work underling (and neither did his wife). A character who seemed, to my eyes at least, to be a transgender woman at some point appeared as a conventional man. Was that a coming out? A going in? Both? This isn’t a show I watched for what was going to happen but for who people were going to turn into, or who they wanted to turn out to be. It’s a show about the way your online profile can diverge from your real-life identity, yes, but also the way you can choose a self or a self can choose you.

There’s also the choice to ignore the matter of identity — until, of course, it starts to aggravate your complacency. Not far into the flap over Dolezal, another alarming story took over the news, a story that challenged the myths white America tells itself about progress. This story was about Atticus Finch, the protagonist of Harper Lee’s 1960 classic, ‘‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’’ Atticus single-handedly fought racism in the fictitious Alabama town of Maycomb, and he became a window through which we could see a version of tolerance, someone holy enough to put on stained glass or money. But in ‘‘Go Set a Watchman,’’ the sequel to ‘‘To Kill a Mockingbird,’’ published in July, Atticus was given a scandalous status update: He had been aged into a racist.

I can’t recall the last time the attitudes of a single fictional character led the national news. But there was bigoted old Atticus, on the front pages, being discussed on cable. One of the most iconic white antiracists had grown fond of white supremacy. It raised an uncomfortable question: If you had identified with the original Atticus Finch, did his Archie Bunkerization make a racist out of you too? The public hand-wringing was a perverse refreshment because, even if only for a few days, it left white people dwelling on race as intensely as nonwhite people. This new Atticus was a betrayal of white liberal idealism, feeding a suspicion that that idealism was less than absolute — that it could suddenly, randomly turn against the people it purported to help.

It was almost as if Lee knew, in 1957, about the mood of the country in 2015 — about the way a series of dead black men and women would further cleave apart the country; about the massacre of nine black churchgoers by a young white supremacist in a South Carolina church, and the ensuing debate over the Confederate flag; about the fear of inevitable, inexorable racial, gender and sexual evolution; about the perceived threats to straight-white-male primacy by Latino immigrants, proliferating Spanish, same-sex marriage, female bosses and a black president.

The yearning to transcend race keeps coming up against the bedrock cultural matter of separateness. But the tectonic plates of the culture keep pushing against one another with greater, earthquaking force. The best show in our era about that quake — about the instability of identity and the choosing of a self — has been ‘‘Key & Peele.’’ For five seasons, in scores of sketches, two biracial men, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, became different women and different men of different ethnicities, personalities and body types. They were two of the best actors on television, hailing from somewhere between the lawlessness of improv comedy and the high-impact emotionalism of Anna Deavere Smith’s one-woman, zillion-character plays. ‘‘Key & Peele’’ granted nearly every caricature a soul.

The show started as a commentary on the hilarious absurdity of race, but it never fully escaped the pernicious reality of racism. The longer it ran, the more melancholy it became, the more it seethed. In the final episode, its anger caught up with its fancifulness and cheek, exploding in an old-timey musical number called ‘‘Negrotown,’’ which opens with a black man (Key) being arrested by a white cop one night while walking down a dark alleyway. He says he’s innocent of any wrongdoing and asks why he’s being arrested, intensifying the cop’s anger. Entering the police cruiser, he hits his head on the car door. Suddenly, a homeless man (Peele) arrives on the scene and offers to take the black guy off the cop’s hands. The cop gratefully acquiesces.

Taking the disoriented man by the hand, the homeless guy leads him through an alley door. They find themselves on the threshold of a sunny neighborhood. The homeless guy is now dressed in a three-piece suit the color of pink grapefruit meat, and he begins to sing in a camped-up, zero-calorie Paul Robeson baritone about this new place, ‘‘where there ain’t no pain, ain’t no sorrow.’’ Black people in bright clothes are dancing in the streets, singing in giddy verse about the special virtues of their town: You can get a cab to pick you up, have a loan application approved, even wear a hoodie without getting shot. Plus: ‘‘There’s no stupid-ass white folks touching your hair or stealing your culture, claiming it’s theirs.’’

But it’s clear from the start that the ‘‘neighborhood’’ is a studio backlot, and the dancers are costumed in the colors of Skittles, and their dancing involves a lot of grinning and spinning and stretching out their arms — shuffling. Black freedom looks like a white 1940s Hollywood director’s idea of it. At the end of the number, the dancers stand frozen with their arms raised in a black-power salute, as if waiting for someone to yell ‘‘cut.’’ No one does.

The dream melts away, and we’re back with the guy being arrested, passed out on the ground. The cop starts shoving him into the cruiser. ‘‘I thought I was going to Negrotown,’’ he says.

‘‘Oh, you are,’’ the cop replies, as the piano riff from the song starts to play and the car drives off.

The show left us with a dream of Edenic self-containment as the key to black contentment — a stunning contradiction of all its previous sketches. It was a rebuke to both racial integration and ghettoization. It split me open. I cried with laughter at the joke of this obviously fake place as a kind of heaven. I cried with sadness, because if you’re in Negrotown, you’re also in a special ring of hell.

The bitterness of the sketch made me wonder if being black in America is the one identity that won’t ever mutate. I’m someone who believes himself to have complete individual autonomy, someone who feels free. But I also know some of that autonomy is limited, illusory, conditional. I live knowing that whatever my blackness means to me can be at odds with what it means to certain white observers, at any moment. So I live with two identities: mine and others’ perceptions of it. So much of blackness evolving has been limited to whiteness allowing it to evolve, without white people accepting that they are in the position of granting permission. Allowing. If that symbiotic dynamic is going to change, white people will need to become more conscious that they, too, can be perceived.

It could be that living with recycled conflict is part of the national DNA. Yet it’s also in our natures to keep trying to change, to discover ourselves. In ‘‘Far From the Tree,’’ Andrew Solomon’s landmark 2012 book about parenting and how children differentiate themselves, he makes a distinction between vertical and horizontal identity. The former is defined by traits you share with your parents, through genes and norms; the latter is defined by traits and values you don’t share with them, sometimes because of genetic mutation, sometimes through the choice of a different social world. The emotional tension in the book’s scores of stories arises from the absence of love for or empathy toward someone with a pronounced or extreme horizontal identity — homosexuality or autism or severe disability. Solomon is writing about the struggle to overcome intolerance and estrangement, and to better understand disgust; about our comfort with fixed, established identity and our distress over its unfixed or unstable counterpart.

His insights about families apply to us as a country. We’re a vertical nation moving horizontally. We’re daring to erase the segregating boundaries, to obliterate oppressive institutions, to get over ourselves. Nancy Meyers knows it. Sam Esmail knows it. So, in his way, does Donald Trump. The transition should make us stronger — if it doesn’t kill us first.",REAL
The Passion of Nicki Minaj,"Soon, our characters gathered in the V.M.A. Thunderdome, where things that are not quite true are staged in a crude, middle-school-esque pageant, with players jockeying for time. And indeed, Swift and Minaj, having reached a truce, opened the show together. But later, as Minaj slinked onstage in a revealing dress that closely resembled gold filigree on a china cup to accept her award — for Best Hip-Hop Video, which is not as important as Video of the Year: ‘‘I saw [Cyrus] just looking at me, with her face screwed up, and I thought, What the!’’ she told me in mid-September, in the Trump hotel in Columbus Circle, while visiting New York for Fashion Week. Onstage, Minaj next did something exceedingly rare in the commercial music world. She addressed Cyrus with real venom — ‘‘This bitch that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press’’ — and pointed at her with a manicured finger: ‘‘Miley, what’s good?’’ MTV cut Minaj’s mike, but you could see her lips forming the words, ‘‘Don’t play with me, bitch.’’

A month later, the episode was still bothering Minaj. Addressing Cyrus, she told me: ‘‘The fact that you feel upset about me speaking on something that affects black women makes me feel like you have some big balls. You’re in videos with black men, and you’re bringing out black women on your stages, but you don’t want to know how black women feel about something that’s so important? Come on, you can’t want the good without the bad. If you want to enjoy our culture and our lifestyle, bond with us, dance with us, have fun with us, twerk with us, rap with us, then you should also want to know what affects us, what is bothering us, what we feel is unfair to us. You shouldn’t not want to know that.’’

Minaj stands a bit over five feet tall, and as she padded around barefoot in her hotel suite, there was a tangle of shoes and outfits collected nearby that she had considered but rejected for Fashion Week. Outfits carefully sewn to the measurements of a six-foot-tall model with hipbones like handlebars don’t fit a shapely-all-over woman, and Minaj, like Kim Kardashian, favors garments with spandex in them. In the last 24 hours, she had poured herself into a nude mesh Alexander Wang dress that the most party-hearty 19-year-old would choose only as a beach cover-up; changed to a fire-engine-red two-piece zip-up suit for Wang’s after-party; danced at Jay-Z’s 40/40 Club in the Flatiron district for hours; hit the recording studio with her boyfriend, the Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill; then, finally, crawled into bed in the hotel on the Upper West Side at 7 a.m. She woke up at 3:30 p.m., changing into purple leggings and an oversize black T-shirt, though remnants of the night’s ensembles remained — her hair swept up in a gun moll’s bouffant, a smidge shorter than Amy Winehouse wore hers; several diamond stud earrings crawled up her right ear like a series of buttons on the back of a Victorian gown.

Minaj may have had a fair amount of influence over the fact that pop stars are constantly telling us they’re bosses, or they’re bitches, or they’re ‘‘boss bitches,’’ which seems like a contradiction, or redundant, but is said without a trace of irony. A unique figure who draws 10-year-old girls as fans with her Technicolor wigs, sophisticated mimicry and playful attitude, Minaj also assumes a persona as aggressive, dis-happy and vulgar as any man in hip-hop. She electrifies tracks merely by appearing on them, from Kanye West’s ‘‘Monster’’ in 2010 (‘‘First things first, I’ll eat your brains,’’ she explains) to the electronic dance music artist David Guetta’s ‘‘Hey Mama,’’ with a video featuring her gyrating in a desert scene resembling Burning Man. She’s also the first woman to rise to the very top of the rap game not only as a star but also as a business entity. ‘‘My wrists look like I am a jewel thief/But that’s just cuz I am a boss bitch/Now macaroni cheese and grill my swordfish,’’ she says in a song entitled, appropriately enough, ‘‘Boss Ass Bitch.’’

There’s nothing new about female artists struggling with issues of power and control, but we’re far today from the 1990s, when Queen Latifah proclaimed ‘‘every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho/Trying to make a sister feel low/You know all that gots to go.’’ ‘‘Bitch,’’ in music, used to be an insult, a sneer, and it still can be. But female empowerment is a trend, and the word has been reclaimed — by Minaj, in many a track; by Rihanna, in ‘‘Bitch Better Have My Money’’; and triumphantly by Madonna, in her recent track ‘‘Bitch, I’m Madonna.’’ This is good for business and either good for women or not good for women at all.

In another era, Minaj’s sexuality, expressed semi-parodically — pretending she’s a Barbie doll; glorifying women dressed as prostitutes and set in red-light-district windows — might have given feminists pause. But in the 2010s, we have entered a different world in pop culture, one in which sexual repression is perceived as burdensome and perhaps even an inability to holistically integrate the body and self. Young people are identifying and exploring formerly unknown, or at least unlabeled, frontiers of sexuality and gender. And the fact that Minaj is in charge of her own objectification (describing her vagina with more words than I thought existed, and then amplifying its power by rhyming those words), as well as her own monetization (overt product placement in videos is a hallmark) has led most feminist voices to applaud her. But the writer Bell Hooks remains unimpressed, saying of ‘‘Anaconda’’ at a New School panel titled ‘‘Whose Booty Is This?’’: ‘‘This [expletive] is boring. What does it mean? Is there something that I’m missing that’s happening here?’’

‘‘The frequency that Nicki works on is not the easiest frequency for us to wrestle with, because it’s about autonomy, and who has it, and whether we can actually tell the difference between self-objectification and self-gratification,’’ says Treva B. Lindsey, an assistant professor of women’s, gender and sexuality studies at the Ohio State University, continuing: ‘‘Do we even know what an autonomous female looks like in pop culture? What does control even mean in such a corporatized mass-media space?’’

On hip-hop radio shows, the dominant journalistic genre for the art form, Minaj speaks with a Queens accent, sometimes injecting it with Caribbean flair. But there was no evidence of that at the hotel, where she spoke in a night-after whisper that sounded like the hiss of a record before a song begins to play. ‘‘I never was political or preachy, but I’d stop my show and do two minutes of talking to my girls, boosting them up,’’ Minaj said, sitting in a small, straight-backed chair upholstered in the light gray fabric ubiquitous in luxury hotels, Columbus Circle’s billboards pulsing in the background as dusk fell. ‘‘They’d go home feeling, ‘Can’t nobody tell me [expletive].’ ’’ And as her career went on, she realized she had more to say. ‘‘We got so many girls right now having children and don’t even know the first thing to say to a child, but you’re having a child because ‘I want to keep this dude,’ or it just happened,’’ she explains on her second album. ‘‘Why are we never in control? Why are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it’s something wrong for waiting to have a baby, waiting until you’re 35 or 36 to have children? Technology has changed — you can wait! Have something to offer them.’’

Minaj has a shockingly beautiful and complex face, with a wide, high forehead, dark, almond-shaped eyes and deep dimples on both sides of her cheeks that materialize when she smiles. But when asked if she felt confident in her looks as a kid, she said, ‘‘Hell, no!’’ She paused. ‘‘Now, I want to take steps to become more aware of who I am, what I like or dislike about my body — why is that?’’ she said. She mentioned how insecure she felt on Instagram, ‘‘where everyone is freaking drop-dead gorgeous.’’ Don’t get her wrong, she said: Like most celebrities, she approves the pictures that appear on her Instagram and other social-media accounts. ‘‘I get that people put filters on their pictures — I definitely use filters — but I didn’t know people retouched,’’ she says, excitedly talking about being in a nightclub the other day, taking pictures with a friend, and how the friend ‘‘cleaned all the sweat off our face’’ before she posted the photo. ‘‘We’re in a club! We can have a moist, dewy-looking face.’’

She laughs for the first time in our conversation, dimples popping everywhere, sun radiating through the room. ‘‘People’’ — famous people, she means — ‘‘are posting pictures of working out, and then there’s a change in their body” most likely from plastic surgery, “and they say it’s because they were working out! Ah-hahahaha.’’ Then she turns serious again. ‘‘Back in the day, in hip-hop, the thick girl was glorified. Now the rappers are dating skinny white women. So it’s almost like, ‘Wait a minute, who’s going to tell the thick black girls that they’re sexy and fly, too?’ ’’

One of Minaj’s most fascinating stylistic tricks as a performer has been incorporating alter egos, not only the Barbie doll (which she calls Harajuku Barbie) but Roman, an outspoken gay boy who lives inside of her. These alter egos, which have extensively detailed identities, seem exemplary of the way that women are forced to assume different personae to get through the day. But when I asked why she hadn’t called on them much on her last album, she gave me a vague answer about how they were only ‘‘funny’’ and were still around somewhere. Early in her career, she also adopted Lady Gaga’s method of saturating the media with outrageous costumes, but now, when I asked if Gaga influenced her, she shot back, with a look of such intense disapproval my hair curled: ‘‘I don’t even want to discuss that. That’s so old to me.’’

Minaj, tough in general, is known to be particularly tough with the press, like rappers tend to be. ‘‘You have to be like a beast — that’s the only way they respect you,’’ she said, in a soft-focus MTV documentary on her life, explaining that she walks out of photo shoots when there’s ‘‘a $50 clothes budget and some sliced pickles.’’ She’s also guarded about her past, and much of her present. Born Onika Maraj in Trinidad in 1982, she moved to the United States several years later (her parents spent two years in the States before she arrived, trying to get settled). Minaj has long emphasized her difficult upbringing — speaking openly about crack cocaine use in her home, in Jamaica, Queens, as well as domestic abuse and an episode when she says her father tried to burn down her house. But it’s difficult to reconcile those stories with the recent announcement that she’s developing a show about her youth for ABC Family. When I asked if her father abused her, she said: ‘‘No. He was just abusive.’’ She continued: ‘‘I would always hear him yelling and cursing, always. And it made me feel it was the way to interact, because that’s how I saw him interacting.’’ She said her parents’ marriage wasn’t a happy one. ‘‘When I was younger,’’ she explained, ‘‘I thought that the only reason my mother didn’t leave my father was for financial reasons.’’ She went on: ‘‘From early on in my life, I looked at a woman not having her money as the biggest curse,’’ and then added, ‘‘Now that I’m an adult, I realize that women stay whether a man’s rich or poor. It’s just a weakness.’’

Like Lady Gaga, who starred in plays while attending the Upper East Side’s Convent of the Sacred Heart, Minaj has drama-school chops. She studied theater at the Upper West Side’s LaGuardia High School — the school from ‘‘Fame’’ — working on her freestyle rap skills in the lunchroom. After graduation, she waitressed at Red Lobster to make money and sang choruses on low-level rappers’ tracks. One day in a recording studio, she asked a local artist if she could write a rap. ‘‘I wrote eight bars while he was in the booth, and he asked to hear it, but I was too shy. I said, ‘Can I just go spit it?’ ’’ Minaj was in her neighborhood when she heard the song booming out of his car. ‘‘He was playing it proudly, and that was my first indication — maybe I’m good.’’ She began locking herself in her room for hours and hours with her beat CDs, she says. ‘‘Eventually my mother would come in to check if I was alive.’’

Minaj’s darkest period may have started when she tried to make it in the men’s world of hip-hop, in about 2002. But when I asked for details, she said, ‘‘I’m not approving or confirming anything you said.’’ A sketch for this time, then, begins when producers placed her in a group called the Hoodstars with three men, including Safaree Samuels, who would become her boyfriend of a decade; failing to secure a recording contract, Minaj began to rebuild herself as a solo act. In 2006, another producer, Big Fendi, christened her Nicki Minaj (‘‘Fendi flipped [my name] when he met me because I had such a nasty flow! I eat bitches!’’ she said, in an early interview). He reimagined her as the new Lil’ Kim. Kim, the Biggie Smalls protégée, wore wigs, pretended to be a black Barbie and not only rapped about her genitalia but called attention to it in photo shoots that Minaj recreated. (At some point, Minaj also sold her mixtapes out of her white BMW 323i, a car she says she scrimped and saved to buy. I’m not sure when that was, because after I asked about it twice, she told me it was a dumb question.)

Enticing big-name rappers to add a couple of bars to your tracks, or securing a guest spot on one of those rappers’ songs, is the way to build fame in hip-hop, and Minaj proved herself to be adept. She garnered guest verses from hip-hop royalty, including Lil Wayne. But her manager at the time, Debra Antney, who was born in Jamaica, Queens, before becoming an Atlanta hip-hop matriarch (and also the rapper Waka Flocka Flame’s mother), says, ‘‘Nicki was the timidest little girl you’d ever want to see in your life — she was so broken up, but she was so determined, all in one breath.’’ Timid? ‘‘I used to have to scream at her: ‘You’re not going to sit here and cry, you’re not going to let nobody shut you down, that’s what you’re not going to do,’ ’’ she says.

Minaj knew with whom she preferred to be aligned, though he didn’t sign her until 2009: Lil Wayne, whose label, Young Money, is part of Cash Money, co-founded by Bryan Williams, known as Birdman. Wayne is ‘‘a master of psychology. This guy has studied words. This guy is a poet,’’ she told Dazed magazine. She was marketed as a multigenre artist from the beginning, writing her own raps but also using the assembly-line process of pop. ‘‘Nicki, with her theater background and ability to take on a range of accents, is extremely well suited to the way that pop music is made today, when the artist is a vocal actor not asked to say something that’s profound but rather play a role in a song that someone else has written,’’ says John Seabrook, author of ‘‘The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory.’’ But building her as a brand, long a part of the culture of hip-hop, was ‘‘the furthest thing from breezy,’’ says her manager, the Maverick management group co-founder Gee Roberson. Securing a fragrance deal, a Glu mobile game, an alcoholic drink — all of that requires entering executive suites ‘‘dominated by men.’’

During her rise, Minaj didn’t publicly announce that she had a boyfriend — she introduced Samuels to the world only as a valued producer, continuing the long tradition of sex symbols appearing sexually available to their fans. She has since changed her attitude about that, and has not been shy about being in love with her current boyfriend, Meek Mill, pointing toward the bedroom whenever his name came up tonight. He recently had his own beef, with Drake, Minaj’s labelmate, during which — this is an abridged version — Meek attacked Drake for using a ghostwriter, and Drake struck back with what seemed like an endless series of dis tracks, one of which asks, ‘‘Is that a world tour or your girl’s tour?’’ That Minaj managed to stay above this is significant. ‘‘Historically in hip-hop, female rappers have always had to stand next to a male rapper in order to maintain relevance, or keep their spark,’’ says Charlamagne Tha God, the outspoken host of the radio station Power 105.1’s program ‘‘The Breakfast Club.’’ ‘‘What happened with Drake and Meek won’t have any effect on Nicki at all, and in fact I think Nicki is so strong that she’s one of the reasons people haven’t completely said Meek is done.’’

Minaj talked a bit about dealing with men and work. ‘‘Since I was 15, I came out of one relationship and went into another relationship,’’ she told me. ‘‘In my relationships, I’ve been told, ‘You don’t have to work that much.’ But I can’t stop working, because it’s bigger than work to me. It’s having a purpose outside any man.’’

Meek’s beef with Drake was different from Minaj’s beefs with the pop queens. It was an old fight, about authenticity — the oldest dust-up there is in hip-hop. Minaj is fighting newer battles. While discussing the state of women in the music business, I asked about the ethics of ‘‘Straight Outta Compton,’’ the N.W.A. biopic that does not include a reference to Dr. Dre’s history of abusing women. ‘‘I don’t know anything about that,’’ she said. Then I asked about the dramatic goings-on at her label: Wayne is suing Birdman for $51 million for withholding fees, and Wayne’s tour bus was riddled with bullets in Georgia earlier this year. A federal indictment claims that individuals connected to another Cash Money rapper, Young Thug, may be responsible.

This was not the game Minaj was here to play — interviews in the social-media era are about being adored, not interrogated. It was getting dark outside when I asked about Drake, Meek, Wayne and Williams. Minaj hadn’t turned on lights, so she was in shadow. ‘‘They’re men, grown-ass men,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s between them.’’ How does it make you feel, I ask? ‘‘I hate it,’’ she said. ‘‘It doesn’t make me feel good. You don’t ever want to choose sides between people you love. It’s ridiculous. I just want it to be over.’’

‘‘Is there a part of you that thrives on drama, or is it no, just pain and unpleasantness—’’

The room went quiet, but only for an instant.

‘‘That’s disrespectful,’’ Minaj said, drawing herself up in the chair. ‘‘Why would a grown-ass woman thrive off drama?’’

As soon as I said the words, I wished I could dissolve them on my tongue. In pop-culture idiom, ‘‘drama’’ is the province of Real Housewives with nothing better to do than stick their noses where they don’t belong. I was more interested in a different kind of drama — the kind worthy of an HBO series, in which your labelmate is releasing endless dis tracks against your boyfriend and your mentor is suing your label president for a king’s ransom. But the phrase I used was offensive, and even as I tried to apologize, I only made matters worse.

‘‘What do the four men you just named have to do with me thriving off drama?’’ she asked. ‘‘Why would you even say that? That’s so peculiar. Four grown-ass men are having issues between themselves, and you’re asking me do I thrive off drama?’’

She pointed my way, her extended arm all I could see other than the diamonds glinting in her ears. This wasn’t over yet. ‘‘That’s the typical thing that women do. What did you putting me down right there do for you?’’ she asked. ‘‘Women blame women for things that have nothing to do with them. I really want to know why — as a matter of fact, I don’t. Can we move on, do you have anything else to ask?’’ she continued. ‘‘To put down a woman for something that men do, as if they’re children and I’m responsible, has nothing to do with you asking stupid questions, because you know that’s not just a stupid question. That’s a premeditated thing you just did.’’ She called me ‘‘rude’’ and ‘‘a troublemaker,’’ said ‘‘Do not speak to me like I’m stupid or beneath you in any way’’ and, at last, declared, ‘‘I don’t care to speak to you anymore.’’

I found myself back in the lobby, with its Trumpian brass fixtures and huge chandeliers, with the black bikes stamped ‘‘Trump Hotel’’ tied up in front, and the men in their blue suits coming down the steps jingling change in their pockets, and the regular Upper West Side scene — bankers walking their dogs, tourists on Citibikes going the wrong way, the sound of an express train coming up through the subway grates. Minaj’s actions made sense, in some ways: Even though I had no intention of putting her down as a small-minded or silly woman, she was right to call me out. She had the mike and used it to her advantage, hitting the notes that we want stars like her to address right now, particularly those of misogyny and standing up for yourself, even if it involves standing up for yourself against another woman. I didn’t know how much of it Minaj really felt, and how much it was a convenient way of maintaining control. I only knew that, in that moment, she was a boss bitch.",REAL
Zanele Muholi’s Transformations,"The late-­summer humidity kept causing a dewy shine to sprout above Muholi’s brow, and she rummaged around in the kitchen for something to soften the glare it produced. She found some flour and rubbed it in circles on her forehead. Then she propped a pink plastic mirror onto a counter and stared into it with intense concentration, first creating a tight collar around her neck with the tape and then making four long spokes down her body, carving it into sections. Dumse turned to me and asked, with mock seriousness, if I knew CPR.

The process dragged on. Muholi reapplied tape, adjusted lighting, played African gospel songs on her laptop. This elaborate choreography seemed to be a kind of prolonged foreplay, a delaying of the inevitable moment when she would step in front of the camera and stare into its lens. We had spoken the day before, and Muholi had described self-­portraiture as confrontational, an inward examination that could border on violence. It requires dredging up dormant emotions and painful memories and then putting them on display. The lengthy preparation bordered on playful, but Muholi insists that it is not pleasurable, but necessary.

‘‘The whole thing of turning the camera to yourself — it’s really not easy,’’ she says. ‘‘Because you want to tell the truth, but at the same time you have reservations for confronting the self, dealing with you.’’

In person, Muholi is antic and witty, and when she makes a joke, she follows it up with affectionate taps on the shoulder to make sure everyone feels included. She’s handsome, blessed with an abundance of melanin that keeps her looking much younger than her 43 years. She carries herself with the casual swagger of an off-­season soccer player and dresses the part, favoring cuffed jeans, popped collars and a black trilby hat. In her self-­portraits, however, she likes to alter the contrast so that it darkens her complexion into an oil-­slick black, sharpening her soft edges and transforming her charisma into ferocity.

Muholi’s favorite photograph of herself is one that hung in her mother’s house in Umlazi, the township on the eastern coast of South Africa where she grew up. As she remembers it, the picture captures an inner defiance that she was rarely able to express. She also likes it because it is the only photograph taken of her as a child. Like most black South Africans living under apartheid, her family was very poor, and photographs were a rare extravagance.

Growing up black in South Africa during the ’70s and ’80s meant learning to exercise restraint and refraining from questions about your place in the world. Family histories were often fraught with disturbing memories, and obedience was mandatory, as was carrying identification passbooks that controlled how long blacks could stay in white areas before returning to the townships. Identity was used as a weapon, a tool for subjugation and oppression. Apartheid left a searing impression on Muholi, awakening in her the desire to become a keeper of memories, a warden of truth, given how easily it could be hidden, forgotten, rewritten.

This desire was made stronger as Muholi discovered gaps in her own family history. Even her father’s death, a few months after her birth in 1972, is still a mystery to her, something she never worked up the courage to investigate — what would she uncover, and would it be the truth anyway? Her mother died of liver cancer when Muholi was 37, and Muholi never asked her for details about her early life, like the story of her birth. She does know this: Her first name means ‘‘enough’’ or ‘‘last one’’ in Zulu, and she was, indeed, the last of her father’s children.

Muholi came to terms with her sexuality in 1991, when she was 19, as apartheid was coming apart. South Africa was in upheaval with protests, and the turmoil of the country, combined with the unfamiliar territory of queerness, made adolescence even more difficult. ‘‘This whole notion of coming out over a dinner table — we were limited,’’ she says. ‘‘It wasn’t like: ‘Zanele’s coming out. Let’s have a barbecue.’ No.’’ Her family had other things to worry about.

While her mother accepted her sexuality, Muholi felt she couldn’t be herself in Umlazi. She moved to Johannesburg and, eager to find a creative outlet, applied to film school twice — and was twice rejected. She found work as a hairstylist in the meantime. A client encouraged Muholi to apply for a human-­resources job at her insurance company. She did, and bounced around the corporate world for a few years.

Slide Show

In 1996, South Africa introduced a new constitution with the goal of ushering in an era defined by equality. It included a section prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation — the first of its kind. In 2006, it became the fifth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage — the first in Africa and the second outside Europe. But even now, nearly 10 years later, anti-gay violence is rampant, and black lesbians and transgender men are particularly at risk. A report that aired on Al Jazeera estimated that each year, 500 lesbians in South Africa are victims of a form of sexual assault known as ‘‘corrective rape,’’ intended to ‘‘fix’’ them of their nonconforming sexual orientation.

Early last decade, Muholi began taking down the stories of the lesbians she encountered: horrifying accounts of rapes, assaults, harassment and abduction. Around this time, she started working at Behind the Mask, a blog that covered queer South Africa. Using a hefty S.L.R. camera that she shared with a girlfriend, Muholi photographed these women.

Through an acquaintance, Muholi heard about the Market Photo Workshop, a well-­known gallery and art space in Johannesburg. She applied to its photography program and was accepted in 2003. A studiomate gave her a book by Nan Goldin, the American photographer, who turned her camera on her circle of friends in the ’80s, capturing lives that were at turns seedy and vibrant, brushing up against drag, punk and drug subcultures. ‘‘It was good,’’ Muholi says, ‘‘but I longed for something that was black.’’

Muholi took notes from Goldin, and it shows. Her work from this time is startling in its intimacy: close-­ups of women kissing, in nude embrace, bathing in colorful tubs in their homes. Her photos often provoked controversy in South Africa when they were displayed. In 2009, a government official, Lulu Xingwana, walked out of a Muholi gallery show, calling it ‘‘immoral.’’ One of Muholi’s most remarkable images from this period is of a woman flattening her breasts with white bandages in order to appear more masculine — perhaps even passing as a man. Another is of a woman’s legs, made extraordinary by the presence of a large scar running down the length of one thigh.

Yancey Richardson, Muholi’s American gallerist, first heard about Muholi’s work through her friend Sandra Phillips, the senior photography curator for the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco. Phillips had come across Muholi’s work on a trip to Johannesburg and mentioned it to Richardson. ‘‘She said: ‘You should look at this artist. She is amazing,’ ’’ Richardson says. ‘‘And she wrote the name down for me.’’ Muholi doesn’t have a website, so Richardson had to find her work in person. By chance, in 2012, an exhibition at her own gallery curated by the artist Mickalene Thomas included a few portraits from Muholi’s ‘‘Faces and Phases.’’ The rows of piercing eyes overwhelmed and impressed her. ‘‘The first time I saw her work, I was knocked out,’’ Richardson says. She likened Muholi’s work to ‘‘People of the 20th Century,’’ a monumental photography project by a German artist named August Sander, who dedicated his life to capturing rural life in his home country. ‘‘The kind of work that she’s making is a life work,’’ she says. ‘‘It’s taking years and years.’’

But Muholi never stopped being an activist, even as her work gained renown for its beauty and craft. She still documents gay life in South Africa, in all its complexity, photographing hate-crime scenes and funeral processions as well as weddings and parties. The work she does is draining; it erodes her spirit and interferes with her personal life. ‘‘I’ve listened to so many people’s pain, and it meant I had to sleep with that pain when people moved on with their lives,’’ she says. ‘‘When do photographers get time to deal with their own pain and be given their space to do it? Others will say, ‘Oh, just go to therapy.’ But it is not that simple.’’

Muholi feels that turning the camera on herself will force this introspection. ‘‘This is why the self-­portraits are so major to me,’’ she says. ‘‘We get caught up in other people’s worlds, and you never ask yourself how you became.’’

It was almost midnight by the time Muholi was ready to take her photograph for the day. She eyed a wire fruit basket on the counter nearby and placed it on her head. It could have read as silly, but on her, the effect was Afrofuturistic, even debonair. As she lifted her face to the camera, her visage melted into something pleading and vulnerable. I was perched behind Dumse, who was shooting the photo, and could see Muholi’s eyes, full of a searching, woeful expression. It was hard to look into them directly.

Photography, Muholi says, is her therapy: a daily prayer, written out in the positioning of her limbs and the look haunting her face. She thinks of these self-­portraits as autobiographical. They explore the elements of her personality — female, African, gay — and where they blur together and pull apart. She wants to undo the damage of growing up in a society that drew its strength from demonizing blackness, which is part of the reason she drastically darkens her skin tone in the photographs. It is her most deliberate declaration that she is black and that she is beautiful.

‘‘When I was young, I was told that I was ugly, and I had to grow up with a sense of ugliness and shame,’’ she says. ‘‘And I had to overcome it, because nobody can love you more than you.’’ She titled the series ‘‘Somnyama Ngonyama,’’ which means ‘‘Hail the Dark Lioness.’’

Muholi told me she was trying to find her own language to articulate the long-­lasting effects of the politics that have defined her life. She grew up in a culture steeped in rich, idiomatic expressions, and visually, her work echoes that tradition. Muholi is reaching deep into herself, sucking out the troubled history in her marrow. Her self-­portraits explode stereotypes of African women while evoking them, implicating the viewers for summoning those clichés as they gaze upon her skin. What does it mean to see Muholi’s face surrounded by clothespins and see a headdress? Where have you seen these images before? And who took them?

After a few shots, Muholi removed the fruit ­basket from her head and sat down at the kitchen table to load the images into Photoshop. She rapped her knuckles on the table while she waited, fretting out loud that the concept wouldn’t work. The images appeared, and she sighed and rubbed her face wearily. ‘‘Something’s not right,’’ she said softly. I couldn’t see what she meant — the low-lit room had created a soft palette of silvers and grays, and Muholi’s eyes were ablaze. She was almost glaring, as if challenging the viewer to interpret her tableau. The taped lines of the makeshift body armor cut eye-­catching white divots into her smooth skin. The image was stunning. But night was slipping into morning, and Muholi was still not satisfied.",REAL
Elvis Costello Looks Back,"Costello, who is 61, is a prodigious talker, possessed of astonishing recall and a mind that moves like nimble fingers riffling through a box of old albums. He does not always wait for the question or directly answer the one that is asked. Nor does he supply footnotes. You have to keep up, fill in the blanks and get your education on the fly. If you’ve been listening for a while — a few decades, give or take — it all starts to make sense.

I want to ask you about your shifting identity as a musician, about the different genres and styles you’ve absorbed. I started listening to you, I’m old enough to say, right at the beginning, when it was about punk rock and its aftermath. That’s what it sounded like to you.

That’s what it sounded like to me and to other people my age. The big idea was that rock ’n’ roll had become bloated and artificial and that this was something that was going to strip all that away and restore authenticity. But very soon after I started listening to you, it was clear that the picture was much more complicated. I think it was your music that introduced me to country and western, for example, by way of ‘‘Stranger in the House’’ and your cover of Hank Williams’s ‘‘Why Don’t You Love Me.’’ Music is introduced sometime in early childhood. And the significance of that understanding of music, or even awareness, doesn’t arrive until you’re old enough and you’ve got the emotional need of it. I was aware of country music, I was aware that there was music where people wore cowboy outfits and sang. And some of it seemed very jokey. And suddenly, it all hit me — the emotional bit.

As to the identity aspect: My father, Ross MacManus, was a dance-band singer and sang on the radio. But he also made money on the side doing — I call them ‘‘ghost records’’ — cover records that were sold in the supermarket and at the petrol station. An Australian producer used to have him come in and record carbon copies of hits of the day, four titles in an hour. And they would put those four titles out on an EP. Sometimes my dad was all four voices on an EP but different identities. He’s Hal Prince on one thing. Then he’s Frank Bacon and the Baconeers doing ‘‘She Loves You.’’ Then he’s a member of the Foresters, on Peter, Paul and Mary’s arrangement of ‘‘Blowing in the Wind.’’

And so you can imagine, I didn’t have to give a second or third thought to the idea of changing my name, because my dad had been doing it in the ’60s. It just seemed second nature. The songs are malleable, the identities are malleable and in some cases, the music is malleable. What’s ‘‘Act Naturally?’’ It’s a Buck Owens song, but to most people in England, it’s Ringo’s novelty song on ‘‘Help.’’

Your dad, who died in 2011, had quite a musical career. He played ‘‘If I Had a Hammer’’ at the famous Royal Variety Performance in 1963 at which John Lennon told the aristocrats in the audience to ‘‘rattle your jewelry.’’ It's one of those odd things about that time: the coincidence of my dad being on a show with Paul McCartney and Bacharach. In England, because we had so little television and radio, there was only a few hours of recorded music a day, so that live musicians could work. They were either BBC orchestras or orchestras contracted by the BBC. They would have somebody playing light classics and then a dance band and then somebody playing the cinema organ and then a record-­request show for half an hour. It made hearing your favorite record really stick out, but it also offered the opportunity to hear these bizarre renditions of the famous songs of the day. The band that my dad sang with was like a Glenn Miller-style band. But they were playing ‘‘Substitute’’ and ‘‘Like a Rolling Stone’’ ’cause that’s what was in the charts and that’s what my dad had to sing.

The structure of your book is unusual. Biography has never been my favorite genre, but I was captivated by how you find themes and pick them up, without worrying too much about the chronology. Why did you decide to write it? The book coincided with realizing that my father was not well. He had had good health his whole life, and then, just before he was 80, he got Parkinson’s. He’d been so full of stories his whole life, and certain things about my grandfather, I got totally from him. I realized I had a responsibility that was heightened by becoming a father again — putting the things that I’ve done in the context of how I was conditioned to listen to music from childhood. And then looking for just little events, private ones and some of the very public things like Live Aid. So there’s a lot of accounts of my apprenticeship in Liverpool and in London in the early ’70s.

What were your influences then? What were you trying to do? I was playing in public when I moved to Liverpool in 1970. In London, you would have traditional singers and contemporary singers in the same clubs. In Liverpool, you didn’t. The traditional clubs were very seriously about traditional music and Irish music. And if you tried to sing your own song, you were out; they didn’t want to know.

I quickly learned that there were only certain places I could play. I wasn’t like Richard Thompson — I never had this rich language of English or even Irish traditional music. I just had the knowledge of the few records my dad had, you know, a Clancy Brothers record and a Chieftains record. And I knew some songs. I knew some ‘‘rebel songs.’’ I just learned them all by osmosis. Later on I got really, really fascinated by Appalachian music. Of course, they are all the same songs, but somehow I heard them more clearly — Doc Watson and these people. From the ’70s through the mid-’80s, I absorbed all the American music, not just country music like Nashville country music or Bakersfield country music, but older, more traditional styles, even the Stanley Brothers and that stuff. Of course, they were all the same roots. Often you trace them back and they actually are Irish or Scottish songs.

Was country and western a big deal in England? I know that R & B was. R & B was much more. I think I’m right in saying there is an older generation of musicians and music fans who will be perfectly familiar with the Johnny Cash records. I’m not old enough to have more than registered ‘‘Ring of Fire.’’ I had heard ‘‘I Walk the Line,’’ but I hadn’t heard it in the context of all the other songs he did. So it was like, ‘‘Oh, he’s that guy with that unusual voice.’’ And then I was given ‘‘Johnny Cash Live at San Quentin’’ for Christmas. That’s a good Christmas present, a live record from prison.

And then I started to piece together what he was. We didn’t hear a lot of American roots music. Skiffle was a very big thing in England with Lonnie Donegan in the early ’60s. They were playing Lead Belly songs and Woody Guthrie, but they tended to be on the comic end.

So all that music just seemed light. And then I got dropped through the trapdoor by Gram Parsons. When you come across something when you’re ready for it in your life, it hits you with much more force. Like when I heard George Jones and Merle Haggard. It was like, ‘‘Oh, I get it now.’’

How old were you? Seventeen or 18. Maybe 18, 19. There was a rock ’n’ roll revival around 1970, where it brought people like Chuck Berry and Little Richard. I was too young to go to those gigs. I guess I wasn’t really, but I didn’t get myself there. And then I got a Sun compilation that had all these people mixed up, and I had Elvis records, I had all these other people, and then I started to piece it together with Charlie Rich and other people. I never really listened to Elvis. That’s a weird thing to say, I mean with the name and everything. ’Cause I was too young to have been hit full force. The first record of his I really loved was ‘‘Suspicious Minds,’’ which was made in ’69, like a full 15 years after he broke in.

If I had been a big fan, I couldn’t have done it. If they’d suggested I be Marvin Costello after Marvin Gaye, I would have said, ‘‘No way.’’ Or Lennon Costello. I wouldn’t have done it. And then Elvis died six weeks into my professional career. There was a moment of bravado from the record company: Of course, we’ll carry on. Then there was a moment of panic. They had put a lot of what little money they had into releasing my record, and I had formed a band, and we were going around the country. And there was me observing the conversation while my manager and the press officer went: ‘‘Do we have to change his name now? What do we change it to?’’ Half joking, but you could see the fear.

I forget which of the networks rang up about a week after Elvis died, wanting to get me on a segment. ‘‘Hey, we found this guy in England called Elvis, so let’s get him on.’’ It was so transparent. We told them no. We didn’t need to be on American TV that badly.

I’m also interested in what I guess we can call the Burt Bacharach side of your musical personality. Like the country-and-western side, that was there almost from the start. I heard an early bootleg where you were singing — ‘‘I Just Don’t Know What to Do With Myself.’’ Yeah, it was always there. Bacharach became a friend as well as a collaborator. We’re still working together. What an amazing thing to think: It’s more than 20 years since we wrote our first song together. It’s a head-spinning thing: The distance between our first song and now is almost the same distance between ‘‘The Look of Love’’ and when we first started to write together.

I can’t say I understood what he was doing when I was 9 years old. I’d been aware of his melodies since I was even younger than that. ‘‘Magic Moments’’ was, like, 1958. And I love that song. I didn’t know it was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David; that was a song Perry Como sang on TV. I loved ‘‘Baby, It’s You.’’ I thought John Lennon wrote it, because that’s who was singing it.

In England, we heard so many of those songs twice, because of the delay in the release of records from America. It actually heightened the impact of certain types of music: Bacharach, Motown. Some of the soul things were cut by an English artist first. Then three months later, you’d hear the American version and go, ‘‘Ah, that’s what they’re trying to do.’’

I’m always amused by people saying that Bacharach’s music is easy. It’s really complicated. It’s poised and balanced, and everything is exactly where it’s supposed to be. And that tricks people into thinking that it’s not emotional because the kind of people that judge that music harshly only respond to music that makes a great show of its carnality or its emotion, sometimes to the point of parody and melodrama.

When you’re describing some of what Bacharach did, you could very much be describing yourself. You sometimes use that reserve and remove and sophistication as a way of letting the emotion come through. I don’t hear that myself. I’m a finger painter compared to him. I think the difference is that Burt is actually a link to that era of providing songs for singers to sing. In that sense, he is Richard Rodgers. ‘‘Girl’’ or ‘‘Just Like a Woman’’ or ‘‘The Last Time I Saw Richard’’ mark the decision to move beyond that point where the singer, whether deceptively or completely literally, is creating some sort of open-heart surgery in full view of the audience. That’s the form of songwriting that I first responded to when I was old enough to feel those things. When I heard ‘‘Anyone Who Had a Heart,’’ I had no idea what that life was. Five years later, I was living that life.

You’ve talked about the sources of the melodies and the sounds that you want to hear. There’s also the question of the lyrics. When I started out, what I did was write a lot of songs — a very intimate style of writing. It wasn’t best suited for holding people’s attention, even in the clubs I was playing. Before I made my start, I liked people who came from different forms of the singer-songwriter movement. I wasn’t that drawn to prog rock or glitter rock or all these different movements in the early ’70s. I was drawn to music which I later, like a lot of us, denied liking and made snarky remarks about. Of course, if I think about it, the people that we’ve mentioned, like Joni Mitchell — how could you begin to write like that? I was definitely trying to transpose things I’d learned from Randy Newman onto the guitar. And the scale of some John Prine songs and the whimsical nature of some Lowell George songs. Those were the ones that I loved. I didn’t really affect to write like Bob Dylan. Why would you try?

In the book, there is a passage that corresponds to something I remember very well. You were talking about in the late ’70s, in whatever that moment was, the punk-rock moment — Pop-star years. (Laughter) In England, yeah.

You said, ‘‘I think records started getting better again because everyone was dropping that tedious pose that there was no past.’’ Yeah, about 1978, no, maybe ’79, ’80, they sort of gave up that pose.

The pose that everything had to be brand new? Yeah, the ‘‘year zero’’ idea. It was mostly advocated by people who weren’t even musicians; they were the managers. That was a theory. ‘‘No wave.’’ ‘‘Post-punk.’’ They’re all just like: ‘‘O.K., there’s a rule book. Let’s tear it up and start again.’’ I don’t ever remember anybody of much consequence calling themselves any of the names that have been attributed to this music. When I came back to London in ’73, the only person that I knew in a band was Nick Lowe. And I didn’t know him very well, I’d met him in a pub once. So I would go and hang around his gigs and ask him questions. How do you do this? And he would be very patient. And then I met a bunch of guys, and we formed a group. I mean, we didn’t really recruit. You know, it was like literally standing in a basement, and I go, ‘‘What do you do?’’ ‘‘Well, I play a bit.’’ ‘‘And what do you do?’’ ‘‘I play bass. See that guy over there? He’s a drummer.’’ It wasn’t really fate, it was accidental. That was the period where all those groups were playing in pubs because they could take charge of their repertoire. I don’t remember anyone calling it pub rock at the time.

It’s interesting to hear about how you absorbed music when you were young. The way that happens with kids is so different now. For my daughter, who is 16, it’s all in the present. So she listens to the Beatles, she listens to stuff that I listened to when I was her age, which is to say you, the Smiths, the Clash, and it’s not ‘‘old’’ music. I remember when she first started listening to the Smiths, she was furious to discover that I knew all of their records. She thought it was hers.

Yeah, she thought, This is speaking to me, not to some weird old guy. Well, then, I guess it is. I’m not one of those ‘‘it was all better in the past’’ people. Theoretically, and I stress the ‘‘theoretically,’’ it all should be much better now because of the access. What I think is harder is to kind of get it into a diamond. When I worked with Jerry Dammers, with the Specials, there was no sampling, there was no way to do that.

So you had to make the horn charts. Well, he just sort of played, and he had other people playing on the other records. They played these quotations from Prince Buster records, and then he wrote songs over the top of them. Now you probably would just take the original Prince Buster record and sample it and then lay some other stuff on top of it.

I don’t really see sampling as any different from what he was doing or what we were doing on ‘‘Get Happy!’’ where we took a Booker T and the MG’s riff and I wrote another song over it. The principle is the same. What’s not the same is the wit. When it’s done in a bone-headed way, it doesn’t matter whether it’s a written song or a sampled, assembled song.

You can also revive these old forms and change them. I was listening to your version of ‘‘Scarlet Tide’’ recently, the song you and T Bone Burnett wrote for the movie ‘‘Cold Mountain,’’ and of course it’s not a song that could have been written in the Civil War. No, as befits a song written in the ballroom of the Bel Air Hotel.

But when I hear you and Emmylou Harris singing it, I’m haunted by those old songs and that older music. I really am not nostalgic. I’m not at all nostalgic.

Silicon Valley’s Most Elusive Beast,"Photo

In Renaissance Europe, a unicorn horn, known as an ‘‘alicorn,’’ was a must-have accessory for any well-appointed cathedral, monastery or palace. According to Odell Shepard’s ‘‘Lore of the Unicorn,’’ Queen Elizabeth I kept such a horn in her royal wardrobe. Pope Clement VII had one, too, which he ‘‘richly adorned with gold.’’ The unicorn was a revered symbol of Christ, and its horn was believed to possess magical properties. The outlandish prices paid for alicorns — usually narwhal tusks — in the 16th and 17th centuries convey a sense of their assumed potency: One horn could be worth more than 10 times its weight in gold, and Queen Elizabeth was said to have one as valuable as a castle.

Today, the rich and powerful still lust after unicorns, only now their worth can rival the G.D.P. of a small country. That’s because the term, in Silicon Valley, has come to mean a technology start-up valued at more than $1 billion. An analysis of these unusual companies prompted the venture capitalist Aileen Lee to dub them ‘‘unicorns’’ in a 2013 blog post on TechCrunch. The new species, once named, became the perfect totem for a tech boom rising to greater heights each month. The unicorn itself was soon overshadowed by the ‘‘decacorn’’ (companies valued at more than $10 billion) and the ‘‘super unicorn’’ (those valued at more than $100 billion).

This year, unicorn hunting has become a tech-industry obsession. In January, Fortune magazine declared our time to be the ‘‘Age of Unicorns,’’ and a Hong Kong venture-capital firm called Unicorn Capital Partners has raised at least $12 million to finance its quest for the mythical animals. The research firm CB Insights maintains a regularly updated Unicorn List that currently claims that 140 exist, up from the 39 Lee found when she first put a name to the phenomenon. The list includes well-known brands like Uber, Pinterest and Airbnb but also companies you’ve most likely never heard of and will never patronize, like the business-­software start-up Apttus and the cloud identity-management company Okta.

As a term, ‘‘unicorn’’ conjures the gauzy covers of paperback fantasy novels and rainbow-hued cartoons. Not coincidentally, this is more or less in line with the current mood in Silicon Valley. Arthur C. Clarke famously declared that ‘‘any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,’’ and optimists foresee us riding unicorns into this future where the fantastic becomes commonplace: Where car ownership is a relic thanks to Uber; where Facebook unites all of humanity through our common love of dubious clickbait; and where wearable technology gives us superhuman powers. To the faithful, even very young start-ups can be worth billions, because they have the opportunity to tap a larger market of connected customers than ever.

But a backlash against the term and its implications is brewing. Unicorn is ‘‘the most overused word in the technology industry today,’’ the venture capitalist Mark Suster recently griped on his blog. Pessimists argue that the fact that so many companies, some of which have yet to see a dollar in profit, have such breathtaking valuations is a sign that the technology industry is living in a fantasy world. They say founders and investors are disconnected from reality, conjuring numbers out of thin air. When the current tech bubble inevitably bursts and the illusion is dispelled, the argument goes, the unicorn will be revealed as nothing more than a donkey with a cardboard tube taped to its forehead.

This sort of spirited debate has always surrounded the unicorn. The Greek physician Ctesias wrote of the unicorn in fourth century B.C., claiming that in India there lived ‘‘certain wild asses’’ with white bodies, dark red heads, dark blue eyes and, on their foreheads, a single horn. Later, scholars and explorers described unicorns in such wildly varying terms — fearsome and meek, hulking and small, black and white and multicolored — that experts have concluded the unicorn legend arose thanks to excitable Europeans mishmashing the characteristics of exotic animals like the oryx and the Indian rhinoceros in a sort of taxonomical game of telephone. The mystical power of the unicorn’s horn was the most common thread: It was believed to be capable of purifying tainted water, protecting against poison and treating the plague.",REAL
A Wild Swan,"The 12 swan-princes lived on a rock far out at sea and were permitted only an annual, daylong return to their kingdom, a visit that was both eagerly anticipated and awkward for the king and his consort. It was hard to exult in a day spent among 12 formerly stalwart and valiant sons who could only honk and preen and peck at mites as they flapped around in the castle courtyard. The king did his best at pretending to be glad to see them.

Years passed. And then ... at long last. ...

On one of the swan-princes’ yearly furloughs, their little sister broke the spell, having learned from a beggar woman she met while picking berries in the forest that the only known cure for the swan-transformation curse was coats made of nettles.

However. The girl was compelled to knit the coats in secret, because they needed (or so the beggar woman told her) to be made not only of nettles, but of nettles collected from graveyards, after dark. If the princess was caught gathering nettles from among tombstones, past midnight, the stepmother would surely have accused her of witchcraft, and had her burned along with the rest of the garbage. The girl, no fool, knew she couldn’t count on her father, who by then harbored a secret wish to be free of all his children.

The princess crept nightly into the local graveyards to gather nettles, and spent her days weaving them into coats. It was, as it turned out, a blessing that no one in the castle paid much attention to her.

She had almost finished the 12 coats when the local archbishop saw her picking nettles, and turned her in. The queen felt confirmed in her suspicions (this being the girl who shared not a single virginal secret, who claimed complete indifference to shoes exquisite enough to be shown in museums). The king acceded, hoping he’d be seen as strong and unsentimental, a king so devoted to protecting his people from the darker forces that he’d agree to the execution of his own daughter, if it kept his subjects free of curses, unafraid of demonic transformations.

Just as the princess was about to be burned at the stake, however, the swan-brothers descended from the smoky sky, and their sister threw the coats onto them. Suddenly, with a loud crackling sound, amid a flurry of sparkling wind, 12 studly young men, naked under their nettle-coats, stood in the courtyard, with only a few stray white feathers wafting around them.

Actually ...

... there were 11 fully intact princes and one, the 12th, restored save for a single detail — his right arm remained a swan’s wing, because his sister, interrupted at her work, had to leave one coat with a missing sleeve.

It seemed a small-enough price to pay.

Eleven of the young men soon married, had children, joined organizations, gave parties that thrilled everyone, right down to the mice in the walls. Their thwarted stepmother, so raucously outnumbered, retreated to a convent, which inspired the king to fabricate memories of abiding loyalty to his transfigured sons and helplessness before his harridan of a wife, a version the boys were more than willing to believe.

End of story. ‘‘Happily ever after’’ fell on everyone like a guillotine’s blade.

Almost everyone.

It was difficult for the 12th brother, the swan-winged one. His father, his uncles and aunts, the various lords and ladies, were not pleased by the reminder of their brush with such sinister elements, or their unskeptical willingness to execute the princess as she worked to save her siblings.

The king’s court made jokes about the swan-winged prince, which his 11 flawlessly formed brothers took up readily, insisting they were only meant in fun. The young nieces and nephews, children of the 11 brothers, hid whenever the 12th son entered a room, and giggled from behind the chaises and tapestries. His brothers’ wives asked repeatedly that he do his best to remain calm at dinner (he was prone to gesticulating with the wing while telling a joke and had once flicked an entire haunch of venison against the opposite wall).

Finally he packed a few things, and went out into the world. The world, however, proved no easier for him than the palace had been. He could get only the most menial of jobs. He had no marketable skills (princes don’t), and just one working hand. Every now and then a woman grew interested, but it always turned out that she was briefly drawn to some Leda fantasy or, worse, hoped her love could restore his arm. The wing was awkward on the subway, impossible in cabs. It had to be checked constantly for lice. And unless it was washed daily it turned from the creamy white of a French tulip to a linty, dispiriting gray.

He lived with his wing as another man might live with a dog adopted from the pound, sweet-tempered: but neurotic and untrainable. He loved his wing, helplessly. He also found it exasperating, adorable, irritating, wearying, heartbreaking. It embarrassed him, not only because he didn’t manage to keep it cleaner, or because getting through doors and turnstiles never got less awkward, but because he failed to insist on it as an asset.

He could see himself selling himself as a compelling mutation, a young god, proud to the point of sexy arrogance of his anatomical deviation: 90 percent thriving, muscled man-flesh and 10 percent glorious, blindingly white angel wing.

Baby, these feathers are going to tickle you halfway to heaven, and this man-part is going to take you the rest of the way.

Where was that version of him? What dearth of nerve rendered him increasingly paunchy and slack-shouldered? Why was it beyond his capacities to get back into shape, to cop an attitude, to stroll insouciantly into clubs in a black lizard-skin suit with one sleeve cut off?

Yeah, right, sweetheart, it’s a wing, I’m part angel, but trust me, the rest is pure devil.

He couldn’t seem to manage that. He might as well have tried to run a three-minute mile, or become a virtuoso on the violin.

He’s still around. He pays his rent one way or another. He takes his love where he can find it. In late middle age, he has grown ironic, and cheerful in a toughened, seen-it-all way. He’s become possessed of a world-weary wit. He’s realized he can either descend into bitterness or become a wised-up holy fool. It’s better, it’s less mortifying, to be the guy who understands that the joke’s on him and is the first to laugh when the punch line lands.

Most of his brothers back at the palace are on their second or third wives. Their children, having been cosseted and catered to all their lives, can be difficult. The princes spend their days knocking golden balls into silver cups, or skewering moths with their swords. At night they watch the jesters and jugglers and acrobats perform.

The 12th brother can be found, most nights, in one of the bars on the city’s outer edges, the ones that cater to people who were only partly cured of their curses, or not cured at all. There’s the 300-year-old woman who wasn’t specific enough when she spoke to the magic fish, and found herself crying, ‘‘No, wait, I meant alive and young forever,’’ into a suddenly empty sea. There’s the crown-letted frog who can’t seem to truly love any of the women willing to kiss him, and break the spell. There’s the prince who’s spent years trying to determine the location of the comatose princess he’s meant to revive with a kiss, and has lately been less devoted to searching mountain and glen, more prone to bar-crawling, given to long stories about the girl who got away.

In such bars, a man with a single swan wing is considered lucky.

His life, he tells himself, is not the worst of all possible lives. Maybe that’s enough. Maybe that’s what there is to hope for — that it merely won’t get any worse.

Some nights, when he has stumbled home smashed (there are many such nights), negotiated the five flights up to his apartment, turned on the TV and passed out on the sofa, he awakes, hours later, as the first light grays the slats of the venetian blinds, with only his hangover for company, to find that he’s curled his wing over his chest and belly; or rather (he knows this to be impossible, and yet ... ) that the wing has curled itself, by its own volition, over him, both blanket and companion, his devoted resident alien, every bit as imploring and ardent and inconvenient as that mutt from the pound would have been. His dreadful familiar. His burden, his comrade.",REAL
Shooting a Lion,"Photo

I’m sitting with eight other tourists in an open-topped Land Cruiser driving on dirt roads in the Sabi Sand, a group of private game reserves on the southwest border of South Africa’s two-million-hectare Kruger National Park. It’s a landscape of splintered trees and pale acacia thorns, drifts of sand glittering brightly with quartz, and it is full of wildlife: We’ve seen leopards and hyenas, muddy groups of wart hogs, innumerable birds and antelopes. After years of watching wildlife documentaries, spotting animals from the vehicle is a thrilling but disconcertingly familiar experience. Not only do they exactly resemble the ones on TV, but when Jonathan Vogel, the game ranger at the wheel, starts to talk about the animals, his expert tone makes me think of voice-over narration. While I’ve never been on safari before, and though I traveled here to watch animals, I’m spending a lot of time trying to make what is happening seem real.

Safaris are built on a series of vast contradictions. Though the Sabi Sand, for example, is considered a pristine wilderness, it is crisscrossed with dirt roads and dotted with camps offering tourists accommodation and twice-daily game drives. The wildlife that roams within its unfenced interior is absolutely wild, and yet among the most watched in the world. And while people travel here to observe animals, not hunt them, most are keen to collect sightings of those species renowned in the 19th century as being the most dangerous to stalk on foot: the big five of lions, leopards, buffaloes, rhinos and elephants. Animals that hunt other animals are the biggest draw here. ‘‘If you want to come for predators, I think the Sabi Sand is definitely the place,’’ Vogel explains. ‘‘It’s not just that they are beautiful, but they are entertaining and interesting. The big herbivores, they’ll just go out, eat a little bit, play around, but the predators, I mean, they’ll stalk, they’ll fight, they’ll mate; everything is unique.’’

We’re in luck. As dusk falls, we pull off the dusty road and cut the engine. A spotlight held by our tracker, Derek, plays across dust and dry grass 20 feet away onto something that looks like a pile of dirty beige suede. Slowly it resolves into a sleeping male lion. His eyes are closed, his mane a bright tangle of fur and shadow. I stare at the prone form. Despite the spotlight on his face, a host of glowing smartphones, the excited voices of my fellow passengers and the insistent peeping of autofocus locks, the lion doesn’t wake. He reminds me of the trophy photographs of the Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer that I saw online this summer; after killing a lion known to safarigoers in Zimbabwe as Cecil, Palmer’s grinning face was seen behind another dead lion he had posed for the camera. It spurred outrage and a white-hot debate over the morality of big-game hunting. What I am doing watching this lion is nothing like trophy hunting, I tell myself, though some part of me isn’t sure.

Trophy photographs seem to most of us an anachronistic display of imperial masculinity and colonial appropriation, and the outrage that followed the death of Cecil the lion demonstrated our keen desire to distance ourselves from everything these photographs evoke. But the way safaris work in our culture makes me wonder about that distancing. Safaris offer close-up, once-in-a-lifetime views of animals in the wild — but at the same time they are deeply embedded in colonial iconography and in structural inequality. It is hard not to recall that when Kruger and other game reserves were founded, they were cleared of their original human inhabitants. A game ranger at another camp told me that when you drive around his area, you can still see the old stones where grandmothers once ground meal. Though these days some local communities do benefit economically from safari tourism, the Kruger region has a history of human dispossession and erasure.

Tourists come for a luxury version of an imagined safari past — lamplight, dinners around the fire, safari clothes, Champagne and photographs of only the most photogenic of exotic animals. It’s possible to try to see the luxury safari as a kind of playacting, a kind of sumptuous ‘‘Out of Africa’’ dreamscape. But are we innocent visitors to this place? Our appropriation of the landscape through photographic safaris is just as bound up in those old colonial structures as trophy hunting is, even if the animals we shoot don’t die.

The lion we are watching raises his head. His nose is dark with old scars, one pale eye discolored. So close to a woken lion, some part of me quails. It is unnerving. I know the lion won’t attack us, but somehow shouldn’t he — shouldn’t we — acknowledge that he might? Vogel turns to us from the driver’s seat. ‘‘See his eye?’’ he says. ‘‘This one, I call him Terminator.’’ Within yards of the animal, I expect to exchange a glance with him. I expect that there’ll be a moment, together, of accepting the fact of the other’s presence in this place. But he looks past us; strobed with camera flash, he begins to walk purposely away. We switch on the engine and follow.

Something about this pursuit feels distasteful. If lions are celebrities, they have their paparazzi too. But there are other uncomfortable analogies: the military-style vehicles, the spotlights, the khaki safari garb. The lion known as Terminator is lying down again, and we are even closer to him now. I can see, even without binoculars, a pale claw wound in the fur above his left nostril and the slow movement of his side as he breathes. I feel vaguely betrayed by his proximity. I think I want it to be harder to see a lion.

Perhaps I am still stuck in that old notion that dangerous wild animals are things to test ourselves against, to be tracked and located through skilled subterfuge and careful field craft. But on reflection I don’t think that is the root of my ambivalence. It isn’t that he is too easy to see. It is that he doesn’t appear to see us at all. The lions here are so utterly habituated to people that they choose to ignore our presence entirely. ‘‘All the animals here have already been born with the vehicles,’’ Vogel later explains. All the same, it is highly unsettling when a wild animal fails to look back at us and acknowledge our existence; not only do we recognize that we are not influencing his behavior, but we also start to wonder if we are here at all. I wonder if this is what spurs our desperate urge to take photographs. If a lion refuses to meet our eyes and grant us the authentic personal encounter with wildness we hope for, we can at least turn it into something we recognize and understand: a lion on-screen.

Suddenly I don’t want to look at this lion anymore. Instead I watch the bright staccato of moths dipping and circling in the dusty air around the headlights and see that amid them is a tiny, rising point of reflected light that is so bright and slow and small it is impossible to know what kind of insect it is. I stare at it, transfixed. It is so much more mysterious than the lion. Perhaps it is compelling because only I can see it, and — in the words of the poet R.F. Langley — I know that ‘‘it will never be seen by anyone who has words again.’’ It is entirely inhuman.

It dawns on me that this is a much better way to think about the lion; as a creature that is precious not because of its place in our human imaginations, not because it relates to human concepts, but because it denies them. There is a lion reality that we cannot access. We live in different worlds, and we cannot really ever meet. It is a poignant yet oddly heartening thought. But then the lion raises himself onto his haunches, shakes his mane, stands in the lights with his head lowered and makes a small, deep growl. His jaws open, and steam rising from his mouth, he lets out a vast, low and terrifying sound that I can feel in my rib cage and sets the whole vehicle vibrating in sympathy. In that instant, my human musings fall away; after all my ambivalence, this roar has taken me into the lion’s world, rendered me a being without thoughts, a being of flesh and fear, terror and simple awe.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Vin Scully,"Photo

Five years ago, a dozen friends and I headed from Los Angeles to San Diego to catch a three-game series between the Dodgers and the Padres. The stated purpose of the trip was a bachelor party for an old friend, but we needed little excuse to follow our home team on the road. When we checked into our hotel, we realized just how closely we had followed them; the Dodgers were staying there, too. This was a little like running into your calculus teacher at the mall. These people aren’t supposed to exist in real life. Excited, we filled out bingo cards with player sightings. But really, we wanted to see only one man: Vin Scully, the team’s announcer since Harry Truman was in office.

One morning, Jon, the groom ­to ­be, walked into a hotel elevator and found himself eyeball to eyeball with Scully. Jon introduced himself, explained the purpose of his visit and asked if he had any advice. After a thoughtful pause, Scully said, in his dulcet New York drawl, ‘‘Ahh, marriage — man’s most optimistic of endeavors.’’ He wished Jon luck, and that was it. Elevator doors opened, folk hero exited. The encounter set our close-knit group aflame. We pulled our liberal-­arts degrees out of their moldering mental storage and began analyzing Scully’s line like the poetry it was, a classic Scullyism — the lyricism, the slightly antique syntax, the dueling notes of mischief and joy.

It may seem odd to feel such devotion to an octogenarian baseball announcer, but Scully is a singular figure. He stands apart from today’s broadcasters, who, with a few notable exceptions, are awful. Largely ex-pros recounting their faded glories and AM radio graduates, they gab in the second ­person as they chew through clichés. Often they offer nothing approaching an insight or a surprising thought for three whole hours — or more. This is perhaps a byproduct of their shifting job description. Once, sportscasters existed for the benefit of people who were listening on radio and would never see the action. They were still necessary in the early days of TV, but the introduction of advanced statistics, on-­screen graphics and instant replay have rendered sportscasters almost redundant. My study isn’t empirical, but I have spent several years streaming the MLB TV package into my frontal lobe, and most games are better enjoyed on mute.

Vin Scully’s Most Legendary Silences: Kirk Gibson’s home run, 1988 World Series: 1 minute, 8 seconds. Hank Aaron’s 715th home run: 1 minute, 45 seconds. Bill Buckner’s error, Game 6 of the 1986 World Series: 3 minutes, 23 seconds.

You can listen to Scully for hours and never hear a familiar platitude or a half-­baked thought. His technique, however, is rather simple. He describes the action in front of him just as he encounters it. His demeanor is jovial, neighborly — Mr. Rogers goes to Chavez Ravine. He quotes Dylan Thomas and offers old-­fashioned homilies about the weather (Scully still refers to a breeze as a ‘‘zephyr’’). He coos over children and leads viewers, his ‘‘friends,’’ through stories about everything from the time he went ice-­skating with Jackie Robinson to the time he dreamed of being chased by a giant clam (he had just shared an Italian dinner with Tommy Lasorda, you see). In his voice, you can hear traces of radio plays, New York’s prewar slums, Broadway — a lifetime of experience spent in what, in its more romantic era, was called show business.

Despite having followed the franchise from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, Scully exhibits little bias for the team that employs him. He remains stubbornly impartial, so much so that the occasional Dodgers player has questioned his loyalties. He loves the Dodgers, but his appreciation of baseball is aesthetic, so he celebrates excellence in the Dodgers ace Zack Greinke as readily as he does in, say, Gerardo Parra, a journeyman outfielder whose strong defensive play when he was on the Arizona Diamondbacks made him a Scully favorite.",REAL
The Unselfie,"Slide Show

What do you look like?

You are the world’s leading authority on the subject. You have studied your face for many years, with life-or-death intensity, in almost every mirror and tinted car window and unrippled pond you have ever passed. You are the Sir Isaac Newton of your own face: the one true discoverer of its laws of motion, its particular gravity.

You are also, simultaneously, the very least qualified person in the world to know what you look like. You have no idea. You have never actually seen your face — not truly, from the outside, the way other people see it. This is because of a nonnegotiable quirk of the human anatomy: You have to use your own face to look at your face. You are both observer and observed.

Selfies make us unhappy (those of us who disdain them) not for the reasons we say they do — the primping, the vanity, the narcissism — but because they isolate this basic discomfort at the center of human life. They flog us with the lumpy, rock-solid knot of subject versus object. Whether or not we ever decide to show our selfies to the world, we all take these images mentally, simply by existing. We present ourselves, and we think about that self-presentation. Even a hermit presents himself in his hermitude.

When he joined Instagram in 2013, the photographer Alec Soth felt the urge to post a selfie. Instead, he started posting a series of photos he labeled ‘‘unselfies.’’ These were selfies in which his face was obscured — by snow, mist, motion, a glass of water. In his unselfies, Soth balances right on the mirrored edge of the selfie paradox. He gives in to the urge as he undermines it. The unselfie documents and annihilates. What we most want to see, what the traditional selfie most wants to show, is absent — and so we are forced to look even harder. SAM ANDERSON",REAL
All Rise for the Soufflé,"Photo

I found a strange note on my desk a month ago: ‘‘Why do soufflés rise and fall?’’

The handwriting was mine, but the note seemed foreign. I’ve never known myself to seek answers to the puzzles of the physical world. I stopped taking sciences after 10th grade, availing myself of a school policy by which enrollment in A.P. classes on a certain number of subjects entitled a student to choose abject ignorance in others. I would be a better person, I counseled myself, if I practiced finding comfort, as Keats put it, in the universe’s ‘‘uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.’’

There’s much to ponder in a soufflé’s rise without involving science. The gastronomic pleasure we take in risen foods — yeasted bread, a buttery biscuit, a high-risen soufflé — seems to derive less from the half that’s there than from the half that isn’t, from the airy absence that makes presence more keenly felt. It is pleasure linked, perhaps, to the one we feel from other risen things, whether the flight of a bird or a soul released from samsara. Most of us fall — morally and physically — sometimes. Fewer of us rise, at least with the apparent ease of yeast or egg white. Up is the direction we are nudged to head, though, and we admire it.

But a month or so ago I needed science’s advice, and the note in question records the occasion. I wanted to make a soufflé without one of its regular ingredients: flour. And so I consulted experts. The digital record of my correspondence shows me for who I am: opportunistic — ready to take full advantage of the curiosity, scholarship and practical wisdom of others; impatient — I want to be told ‘‘It will rise!’’ or ‘‘It won’t!’’; and yellow-bellied— scared my flourless soufflé will fail and, deeper still, scared my unschooled mind will be unable to understand why a delicate pudding puffs.

So: Why do soufflés rise and fall? For quite digestible reasons, even to someone with my shortcomings. In ‘‘On Food and Cooking,’’ his definitive account of culinary science, Harold McGee defines a soufflé as a foam. As in meringues, that other often-delicious foam, the egg at the dish’s center is its engine, its upward course predicting the rise of the creature whose raw material it contains. Egg-white proteins — ovalbumin, ovotransferrin and dozens more — begin folded up, like tiny ribbons or bits of origami. When subjected to the stress of beating by whisk, the proteins invert their introversion, unfolding and grabbing onto one another, creating bubble walls that then trap the air beaten into them. A form emerges. (Whites are beaten alone, without yolks, because yolks contain fats and lecithin that interfere with bubble bonding.)

Photo

In an oven, the foam rises, in accordance with Charles’s law: At a given pressure, the volume of a gas is proportional to the absolute temperature. When air heats up, it expands; when it cools, it contracts. But Charles’s law, McGee writes, accounts for only around a quarter of a soufflé’s rise. The rest comes from water in the bubble walls changing state from liquid to gas. There is now more gas in each bubble, and so they keep rising. Up! Up!

Without flour, or some other solid, chalky substance, the bubble walls would not be as strong. When the bubbles cool, and the air contracts again, they might pop. Reinforced with the starch in flour — or cocoa, which pairs beautifully with melted chocolate and less well with spinach or leeks, which are what I had in mind to puff up — the bubble walls are far more likely to remain intact, even once the air inside them cools. You can put a strong-bubbled soufflé back in the oven, and it will rise again. Up! Up! High heat for one’s souffléing also means a fast and high rise but a more hastily built, less stable structure. Should you like to feel safe — as I learned, via this personal inquest, I do — and also get a soufflé’s cooking done ahead of time, you would make sure to use some flour and cook with low, constant heat, as in a water bath.",REAL
Is My Neighbor Obliged to Report Me to Immigration?,"Your neighbor, it seems. Such a law-abiding soul. Your duty to your wife carries great weight; what about the countervailing responsibility your sharp-eyed neighbor feels to call the feds? Clearly, she’s no friend of yours, and, standing outside the web of partiality, she’s perfectly entitled to inform on you. That doesn’t mean she has a moral duty to run to earth every infraction she happens to know about, like Inspector Javert. Few people would want to live in a world of interfering busybodies, snooping on and reporting their neighbors. She probably wouldn’t, either. So she’s wrong to think that she’s obliged to snitch. If she’s eager to do the right thing, you might remind her that a little human compassion seldom goes awry.

Someone I know through friends is applying for a job at my organization. Unfortunately, she has developed quite the reputation for lasting mere weeks, sometimes days, at previous jobs. She doesn’t get fired; typically, she quits. Perhaps it’s boredom; perhaps it’s that working a day job is naturally beneath her, an aspiring filmmaker. Two years after her last major partner left her because of her inability to hold a job and take it seriously, rumor has it that she has begun to feel shame and might buckle down this time. However, as she applied for the post at my workplace, she asked a mutual friend what it is that we do anyway, and on the day of the interview, she showed up 30 minutes late, incorrectly taking as our address the one listed on Facebook for a public event we’d held last month. The particular position she is seeking is prone to turnover because of the cyclic nature of the work (editing reports that are produced only every few months). Do I have an obligation to my bosses to inform them of her reputation, or is my duty to this acquaintance — to not get in the way of her landing the job? NAME WITHHELD

Once again, the issue of partiality rears its head. There are indeed things you owe people because of your relationships with them — friends, family, employers — and these demands can sometimes pull you in opposing directions. So you ask the right question. Does what you owe this applicant outweigh what you owe your boss?

Well, no. If this were a close friend, you might have reason for reluctance. But the applicant is no more than an acquaintance, not someone with whom you have an important relationship. And you owe something not only to your boss but also to your fellow workers, namely, not to saddle them with the burden of a hopeless colleague. Your position is different from that of the neighbor, who, I said, has no special duty to enforce the law. You do have a special duty to your company.

Even if you did owe this acquaintance something, the evidence suggests she’s not reformed and wouldn’t work out well at your company. Finally, given the way she behaved on the day of the job interview, your employer has plenty of reason to doubt her reliability. So there’s a good chance you wouldn’t be keeping her from getting the job anyway. And learning to be less lackadaisical could prove valuable to her.

Judge John Hodgman on Buying a Night-Vision Camera,"Photo

Tiffany writes: I have episodes of sleepwalking about twice a month. They range from talking to my husband to talking in a demon voice and thinking kids were in our closet. (We have no kids.) I want a night-vision camera to truly understand these episodes. My husband says he’d rather not know all that I do, for fear of discovering something that will unnerve him for life.

I got unnerved for life just reading the words ‘‘demon voice.’’ This is a real problem you need to address with a doctor before you hurt yourself, your husband or your phantom closet kids. So if your husband balks at a night cam, just go buy one in your sleep. You deserve to know your secret somnambulant self. And it might capture behavior that a night in a sleep clinic might miss. Then you can sell it as a found-footage horror movie and make a fortune!",REAL
The Accidental Mourners,"By this point, it was too late to do anything. The people on either side of us had been there for a while and were settled in. They were obviously in mourning. Some people looked extremely upset. We’d been sitting down, and playing along, for a good 10 minutes. We were even wearing dark-colored clothing, though not the smartest things. So, we stayed.

The priest welcomed us, and there was an initial prayer. I bowed my head, and Paul did the same. Even though I’m not a Christian, I decided to say ‘‘amen’’ at the end. It seemed the least I could do, given the circumstances. Then there was a hymn. We found it in the book, and as we began to sing the words, Paul raised his eyebrows to me. I shrugged my shoulders. What else could we do?

The service went on. The man who died was named Colin. A speaker came up and told us all about Colin’s life. People were very upset. I began to feel upset, too, hearing about someone with loving family members and friends who had just died. I felt as if I might cry, and hung my head. When I looked up, the older woman sitting to my right nodded at me consolingly.

Eventually, the service reached a culmination. Colin’s body was going to be cremated. I heard crying a few rows in front. I began to cry as well. I couldn’t help myself. Tears were rolling down my cheeks. I realized that the act of mourning is communal. I could feel the sadness all around me, and was engulfed by it, as if I had been plugged into it just by being there.

After a final prayer, people began to stand up and shuffle out of the pews. We stood and did the same. The lady next to me smiled, but Paul pushed past me and walked swiftly away. ‘‘Toilet!’’ he whispered, looking pained.

‘‘How did you know the deceased?’’ the older woman asked unexpectedly.

Inside, I panicked. But I managed an answer: ‘‘Oh, um, friend of the family.’’ Before the woman could ask anything else, I shot the question straight back.

‘‘Yes, the same,’’ answered the woman. ‘‘Lovely service, wasn’t it?’’

I nodded. I think I smiled, but I was full of nerves. I was terrified that the woman would know I was an impostor.

‘‘He was such a kind man,’’ she said. ‘‘So considerate. It’s really sad that he’s gone.’’

Paul had disappeared and hadn’t come back. I nodded, inching my way past the woman as she spoke.

‘‘Colin was a true gentleman. I will miss him, you know.’’

I nodded again. I was burning with shame, from head to toe.

‘‘Are you going back to the rugby club?’’ the woman asked.

I shook my head, and smiled again. ‘‘I’m sorry, we have to rush away. … ’’

‘‘Ah,’’ the woman said.

I began to walk toward the church entrance, as quickly as I could but not so fast that I’d look strange. Paul was standing outside the doors having a cigarette.

‘‘Let’s go!’’ he said as soon as he saw me.

We tried to appear ‘‘normal’’ as we headed back down the path, walking ever more quickly to a cafe. I almost ran inside. After a while, we did go to the big house, and it was everything Austen said it was. I just kept worrying that someone might see us and realize the truth.

The Corpse Reviver Is as Good as Its Name,"Photo

I’m one of those people who start celebrating Halloween on Oct. 1 and keep it going all month. This has as much to do with my mother’s influence as with my eternal fondness for ghosts and skulls and, creepier still, candy corn. She costumed me in Broadway-worthy Cleopatra, Dolly Parton and Morticia Addams get-ups. And she often told a story about a Halloween party she gave in the early 1960s, for which she rented a coffin from a prop house to fill with candy. When trick-or-treaters rang the doorbell, she pointed at the closed coffin and said, ‘‘Help yourselves.’’

This dramatic gesture so spooked some neighborhood kids that they told their parents, who then called the police. A raid ensued, sending a throng of drunken revelers scattering in the streets of the Upper East Side. I always imagine this scene with a manic, horn-heavy Henry Mancini soundtrack.

Thus ended what I’m sure was the most glamorous Halloween party of all time. Except for one thing: My mother had served Zombies, a frightening combination of rum and rum, fruit juice and fruit juice, sometimes sugar, maybe peach brandy and sometimes a finish of yet more rum. I’m not averse to big, fruity drinks. I’ve savored tiki concoctions of many kinds. But I’ve yet to taste a Zombie I’ve loved.

Of course, its name was the sole reason my mother served it at her party. But if you choose your Halloween drink on the basis of its name — and why not? — I recommend that you turn instead to another class of cocktails: Corpse Revivers.

Dating back to 1862, these belong to the dubious category of drinks engineered, in a counterintuitive, vaguely homeopathic way, to vanquish hangovers, like other well-known hairs-of-dogs. I would be remiss to endorse this application. But the two best-known versions (Recipes No. 1 and No. 2) have an indisputably bracing, no-nonsense quality that does seem to slap a sagging soul back into the realm of the living.

The Corpse Reviver No. 2 has undergone a particularly robust resurgence, and it’s easy to see why: Bright and lemony and dry but not too dry, given dimension by a veil of absinthe, it’s remarkably easy drinking for something so strong. But its less-loved kin, the Corpse Reviver No. 1, should not be overlooked (and the heat of the brandy and the apple flavor of the Calvados make it more seasonally suited to autumn than the No. 2). It’s an elegant and powerful cocktail.

Bartenders have devised myriad variations. Among my favorites is the Corpse Reviver No. 28, created by Mimi Burnham of Porchlight bar in Manhattan. She replaces the dry gin of the No. 2 with a heavier, barrel-aged genever (a Dutch gin), and the absinthe with liqueur de sapin, which is a sweet, seductive spirit made with pine buds. When she has the time and inclination, Burnham cuts orange peel into the shapes of tiny men and sets them to float, or drown, in the drink as a garnish. That’s Halloween spirit. My mother would have approved.

How to Design a Font,"Photo

‘‘Ask yourself, what is the font’s personality?’’ says Nadine Chahine, a type designer specializing in Arabic and the first woman to be type director at Monotype, a 125-year-old global company with a library of more than 18,000 typefaces. ‘‘Is it young? Mature? Childlike? Is it energetic? Serious? Formal?’’ In 2011, An-Nahar, a newspaper in Lebanon, commissioned Chahine to design a font that she describes this way: ‘‘If it were a person who walked into a room, others would stop and listen.’’

After you are clear on the font’s temperament and, above all, purpose (airport signage, say), begin drawing by hand or on a computer. Don’t discount the magnitude of the task. Chahine lives in London but grew up in Beirut, surrounded by what she characterizes as the ‘‘sad state of Arabic typefaces,’’ despite the language’s long written history and elegant calligraphic tradition. Everywhere she looked, she saw signs in Arabic, French and English — and the Arabic always looked sloppy and second-rate.

Before you start shaping letters, you have to make a few basic style choices. For Latin-based scripts, decide if your font is serif (with small embellishing lines) or sans serif (without). For Arabic, choose between the two central calligraphic styles, kufi (squarish) and naskh (rounded). Then sketch the key letters whose basic shape will inform all the rest. For Latin-­derived alphabets, always begin with ‘‘n’’ and ‘‘o.’’ An ‘‘n’’ requires a vertical stroke connected to a curved one. Once your ‘‘n’’ works, mirror it in structurally similar letters like ‘‘m’’ and ‘‘h.’’ As soon as you have sufficient consonants and vowels, string them into words. Then build a full character set (capitalized and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation marks) and write a few paragraphs. Scrutinize the spaces and shapes between characters. ‘‘The letters can be ugly,’’ Chahine says, ‘‘as long as they make good-looking words.’’",REAL

RE: VOYAGES ISSUE

The magazine asked six photographers about the trips they’d always dreamed of taking and let them turn their lenses on those places. The magazine’s photography critic Teju Cole opened the issue with an essay about his six months’ living in Switzerland.

Teju Cole’s ‘‘Far Away From Here,’’ and Bieke Depoorter’s and Glenna Gordon’s photographs [of Istanbul and Nigeria] reminded me that not all voyages involve traveling to faraway places. Cole was remarkable in his detail and precision and beautifully captured Switzerland for those of us who fantasize going there, and Depoorter’s and Gordon’s photographs were of intimate situations most of us would find too uncomfortable to inhabit but want to peer into anyway. I’ll always enjoy stories and photographs of places and people I never knew existed. They awaken the wanderlust in me every time. No matter how far from home we travel, however, we carry our homes with us like turtles — but may have lost the knowledge of the fact along the way. Hopefully, after we have walked over every speck of the earth each one of us will turn our eyes inward to that last unexplored territory and find what the poet Rumi pointed out: ‘‘What you are seeking is seeking you.’’ Kristen Pingry, Fishersville, Va.

It’s a deceptively simple concept: great photography, well edited and presented within a clear, strict, editorial structure; a structure the design builds on with deft variations of scale and careful use of detailing. ... When you have great content, you don’t need to overcomplicate the design; that said, don’t underestimate the work that has gone into these pages. Jeremy Leslie in magCulture, a website about editorial design

I was particularly struck by two sentences in Cole’s essay: ‘‘I was most at home in Switzerland precisely because I wasn’t. It made me happy because it couldn’t.’’

This might be the case for most new places we visit (and know we will never be truly a part of), but I have always felt this soothing, almost melancholic form of happiness to be the strongest once I cross the border to Switzerland. To me, it is very much connected to this supercooled look of things you see from a train window, these unpretentious concrete buildings and semi-industrial zones flying past in front of monumental mountains or the neatly arranged advertising posters for chocolate or watches in a deserted waiting area of a cable-car station on a weekday.

RE: SMARTPHONES

In a web-only piece, Susan Dominus wrote about smartphones and parenting and the irresistible drive to be productive at all times.

The problem is not that parents are paying less attention to their children; it’s the fact that what they are focused on on their phones is not transparent. I wonder if another side effect of this lack of transparency is that children do not learn how much time adults allocate to certain activities. I knew that my parents valued keeping up with the national news because I could see them reading the paper and watching the evening broadcasts. Maybe children today are having a harder time becoming adults because they don’t actually know what adults do. E. Purcell, Greeneville, S.C., in a comment on nytimes.com

I think there is a myth that before smartphones, everyone engaged in long, free-ranging, relaxed conversations with good eye contact and great posture. Or ... wait, was that before television? No, it was before radio and recorded music. Yes, that’s right; in 1910, the world was perfect, except for those people with their noses buried in books — so, before books, people used to talk. Plato thought that writing destroyed communication. Whatever; I know for sure that when I was 12 — whenever that was — it was a much better world. John, Turlock, Calif., in a comment on nytimes.com

I don’t have a smartphone, and it’s true, whenever I see someone using one, I assume they’re doing something essentially trivial, though for all I know they’re reading Tolstoy. But — let’s face it — usually they’re not. I’ve managed to hold off on getting a smartphone, for now, because it’s just too creepy to see all those people leaning over them like they’re praying.

Donald Trump Is Not Going Anywhere,"I encountered the phenomenon up close at the first Republican debate, on Aug. 6 in Cleveland. I positioned myself in the post-­debate ‘‘spin room,’’ the area where campaign surrogates spew their customized nonsense to media types. The candidates themselves almost never venture in. But suddenly, at the end of the night, a literal stampede was rumbling toward a far corner of the room, where Trump had crashed this assembly of polite company. I have seen many press scrums, but never like this. It was scary. People were tripping, falling and being shoved out of the way. Cameras were dropped. What I saw was polite routines and traditions breaking down as the American political order reoriented itself around a new center of gravity. As the shouts and cries intensified, I found myself being drawn toward the bedlam.

In the months since, Trump has grown into a kind of one-man chaos theory at the center of a primary campaign in disarray. The solemn party leaders desperately want him to go away; the consultant and donor class feel irrelevant (because they largely are to Trump); even Fox News, with which he episodically feuds, seems rattled. At the first sign that, after an uninspired performance in the second debate, Trump’s poll numbers were stalled, pundits on the left and the right rushed to declare yet another ‘‘beginning of the end’’ for Trump. And still he leads in every poll, and it’s October, and it keeps going. Where does this end? I kept asking Trump this as we sat around his office and rode around in limousines and airplanes. ‘‘I have no idea,’’ he always said, sometimes modifying the noun with a big, unclassy profanity. ‘‘But I’m here now. And it’s beautiful.’’

It was early September when we met for the first time in his 26th-floor office in Trump Tower. When I walked in, Trump had the legendary college basketball coach Bobby Knight paying homage to him over speaker­phone. Knight, who had never met Trump, apparently called him out of the blue to offer his support. I was slightly dubious about how ‘‘out of the blue’’ this really was, given how perfectly it was timed to my arrival, but Knight delivered a stirring tribute regardless. ‘‘No one has accomplished more than Mr. Trump has,’’ Knight raved after Trump informed him that a reporter was in the room. Trump nodded and motioned to the ­phone and made sure I had my recorder running. ‘‘What a great honor, man,’’ Trump said. ‘‘I will talk to you soon, and I won’t forget that you called. Thanks, Bobby.’’

Trump is 6-foot-3 and looks taller in person than you might expect, in part because he is all head, hair and flattened, squinty expressions behind the tables and lecterns where we typically experience him. He was standing behind a desk cluttered with papers, piles of recent magazines with him on the cover and a Trump bobblehead doll. ‘‘You ever see guys with nothing on their desk?’’ he said by way of explaining his messy one. ‘‘They always fail. I don’t know what it is. I’ve seen it for years.’’

Trump motioned to the gallery of magazine covers on the wall next to him, which included an issue of Playboy from 1990 (‘‘And that’s when it was really Playboy’’) and another of Trump on the front of The New York Times Magazine in 1984. ‘‘I’ve had much more than 15 minutes of fame, that’s for sure,’’ he said. Trump can be hyper-­solicitous of the press. His orbit is largely free of handlers and is very much his own production, down to his tweets — which he types or dictates himself. I asked Trump if his campaign conducted focus groups. I knew what his answer would be but asked anyway. ‘‘I do focus groups,’’ he said, pressing both thumbs against his forehead, ‘‘right here.’’

Getting close to Trump is nothing like the teeth-­pulling exercise that it can be to get any meaningful exposure to a candidate like, say, Hillary Clinton. This is a seductive departure in general for political reporters accustomed to being ignored, patronized and offered sound bites to a point of lobotomy by typical politicians and the human straitjackets that surround them. In general, Trump understands and appreciates that reporters like to be given the time of day. It’s symbiotic in his case because he does in fact pay obsessive attention to what is said and written and tweeted about him. Trump is always saying that so-and-so TV pundit ‘‘spoke very nicely’’ about him on some morning show and that some other writer ‘‘who used to kill me’’ has now come around to ‘‘loving me.’’ There is a ‘‘Truman Show’’ aspect to this, except Trump is the director — continually selling, narrating and spinning his story while he lives it.

With me, Trump toggled often between on and off the record, one of which seemed only marginally more sensitive than the other, but with enough difference to indicate that he is capable of calculating from word to word and knowing where certain lines are. At one point, Trump declared himself to be ‘‘semi off the record’’ (it wasn’t that interesting, or even semi-­interesting). He kept browbeating me to ‘‘write fairly’’ about him, meaning that I should do a full and proper rendering of the Trump Phenomenon — the full degree to which it is, as he so often says, yooooge. Otherwise it would be ‘‘disgusting,’’ as it was recently when a reporter described a ‘‘smattering of applause’’ that he received at an event in Iowa, when in fact it was much more than a ‘‘smattering’’ — trust him. ‘‘I don’t do smatterings,’’ he said, spitting out the word.

As I surveyed the magazine covers on the wall and endured his running boasts, I wondered aloud whether Americans might not prefer a more humble brand of chief executive, feigned or otherwise. ‘‘Nope,’’ he sneered. ‘‘They want success. They wanted humility in the past. They wanted a nice person’’ (for the record, he added, ‘‘I am a nice person’’). But what they really want is someone who can win, as Trump always does. ‘‘We’re going to have so many victories, you will be bored of winning.’’

I asked whether he had ever experienced self-doubt. The question seemed to catch Trump off guard, and he flashed a split second of, if not vulnerability, maybe non­swagger. ‘‘Yes, I think more than people would think,’’ he told me. When? ‘‘I don’t want to talk about it.’’ He shrug-­smirked. ‘‘Because, you know — probably more than people would think. I understand how life can go. Things can happen.’’ This was a rare moment when Trump’s voice trailed off, even slightly. He then handed me a sheet of new polling data that someone had put on his desk. ‘‘Beautiful numbers,’’ he said, inviting me to take them with me.

A curious feature of the mob scene that has surrounded Trump at most public events since August is that people keep handing him money to sign. I first witnessed this on Sept. 11, a day of national mourning. Trump was working his way through the lobby of Rockefeller Center after taping an appearance on ‘‘The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,’’ and a boisterous crowd had been waiting for him. One building security guard described the commotion to me as ‘‘Justin Bieber level.’’ It consisted heavily of tourists and foreign visitors, many of them young. There were the usual paparazzi, and some shouted questions. But what struck me about this Trumpus Ruckus were the dollar bills. Trump signed one after another, and the recipients clutched and cherished them like winning lottery tickets. ‘‘Look, a hundred-­dollar bill?’’ Trump said, showing me a C-note that a woman from Long Island had handed him to sign. You don’t often see politicians signing money. If asked, some will refuse — I’ve seen Hillary Clinton do this — possibly because it is technically illegal to deface currency. But it is a fitting souvenir from one of the high priests of the nation’s secular religion: aspirational consumerism. Reagan was a capitalist and a free-­market icon, but conspicuous consumption (as people used to call it) was a benefit of American freedom and prosperity, not a national objective or a virtue in itself. Not so much with Trump, who of course owns many beautiful, classy things. There is a certain prosperity-­theology aspect to Trump’s appeal, the idea that you follow a minister because he is rich and has his own plane and implicitly and sometimes explicitly promises that you, too, will be rich.

And yet, throughout his rise, Trump has been labeled a ‘‘populist.’’ I had always equated populism with economic uprisings by the disenfranchised against the privileged. Trump, who grew up in Queens as a son of a wealthy real estate developer, promotes his astronomical wealth, elite academic credentials and ‘‘good genes’’ (‘‘my uncle was a professor at M.I.T., he was the smartest guy up there’’). He is, presumably, the first ‘‘populist’’ presidential candidate to mention his degree from Wharton at a campaign rally in Alabama. Certainly, there have been other rich-guy populists, like Ross Perot. And previous populist movements have, like Trump’s, been driven in part by stoking fear of ‘‘the other’’ (in Trump’s case, his bare-knuckled attacks on the undocumented immigrants who have made the United States ‘‘a dumping ground for the rest of the world’’).

But while populism is often associated with grass-roots movements, Trump’s brand of it flows not from the ground up, as did Obama’s campaign in 2008 or even the Tea Party movement in subsequent years. Rather, Trump’s is pure media populism, a cult of personality whose following has been built over decades. The popularity of Trump’s NBC reality franchise, ‘‘The Apprentice,’’ for instance, made him a potent cultural persona; the power of that persona (the frowning, pitiless boss) might actually outweigh the customary strategic imperatives (message discipline, donor bases) that the political wiseguys like to get all aroused about. In large measure, the core of Trump’s phenomenon is his celebrity itself, which, in today’s America, is in fact as populist as it gets.",REAL
Ellen Page Goes Off-Script,"The exchange produced, to my mind, no clear winner — they were having different conversations, each refusing to accept the other’s terms. The most remarkable thing, to me, was Page’s composure. Among conservatives, Ted Cruz’s debating skills are legendary: He was the star of Princeton’s debate team in the early ’90s, a key player in the postelection wrangling of Bush v. Gore before he turned 30 and, in 2013, the man who shut down the United States government using only the sound of his voice. Page, who is 28, has been working as an actor since she was 10 — her newest film, ‘‘Freeheld,’’ is her 22nd. At the age when many kids go off to college, she was filming ‘‘X-Men: The Last Stand.’’ And yet, during the long conversation with Cruz, Page did not seem nervous, deferential, sniping or off-balance. In fact, she was alert, quick, insistent and polite. She seemed to be driven by a profound moral seriousness.

An hour later, as Page and the ‘‘Gaycation’’ crew sat eating sushi in downtown Des Moines, video clips of the exchange with Cruz had already begun burning across the Internet. Interpretations were fiercely partisan. ‘‘Leave it to a Libtard to ruin a pleasant occasion,’’ someone wrote on Facebook. ‘‘At least one thing is very apparent,’’ another commenter wrote. ‘‘Ellen is extremely smart and Ted is a complete moron.’’ Afterward, when Cruz was asked about the exchange, he said he hadn’t recognized Page. Once he learned who she was, however, he had an easy dismissal. ‘‘I don’t think it’s likely that a whole lot of Hollywood celebrities are going to get behind my campaign anytime soon,’’ he said in a subsequent interview. Page felt differently about the interaction. ‘‘I would love to get lunch with Ted Cruz,’’ she told me. ‘‘In a heartbeat. I would be thrilled to meet him and sit down and not have people around. Just talk. That would be really nice.’’

In 2007, Page experienced the charmed trauma of becoming a Hollywood star. This was thanks to the extremely improbable and sudden success of ‘‘Juno,’’ a low-budget indie film, made in Canada, that wound up conquering the world. Page played the film’s title character, Juno MacGuff, a high-school student who, after an unglamorous episode in a sofa-chair with a friend, finds herself unexpectedly pregnant. Juno handles this existential crisis with wisecracking ennui. ‘‘I’m just calling to procure a hasty abortion?’’ she says, casually, into a phone shaped like a hamburger, as she sits in her teenage bedroom, speaking to a women’s health clinic. Instead of getting an abortion, however, Juno makes her own arrangement: She finds adoptive parents in the Pennysaver and becomes emotionally entangled with them both. The film received a standing ovation at the Toronto Film Festival, was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards and — despite opening in extremely limited release — eventually made more than $230 million.

At the center of that enormous pop-cultural fireball was Page. She was 20, yet she ruled the film with gusto and charisma. ‘‘Has there been a better performance this year than Ellen Page’s creation of Juno?’’ Roger Ebert wrote. ‘‘I don’t think so. ... Page’s presence and timing are extraordinary. I have seen her in only two films, she is only 20 and I think she will be one of the great actors of her time.’’ A.O. Scott, in The New York Times, called Page ‘‘frighteningly talented’’ and said she was ‘‘able to seem, in the space of a single scene, mature beyond her years and disarmingly childlike.’’ This, indeed, is Page’s defining talent: the fusion of innocence and experience. She is archetypally pretty, like a child in a Victorian woodcut, with big eyes, a little upturned nose and a small chin. But Page speaks with the intelligence and world-weary affect of an adult.

Photo

I often find myself, while watching Page’s films, staring at her forehead. It’s like its own system of expression, signaling with surprising quickness and muscularity. A small bit of emotion or perplexity will produce, over the bridge of the nose, two distinctive vertical lines, neat and straight. When Page’s emotions begin to rise — skepticism, distress, anger — the forehead becomes correspondingly complex. Those two neat parallel lines swell, protrude and start to entwine. As things progress, the agitation between the eyes rises farther up the forehead, creating a series of concentric arcs that suggest geological diagrams: ocean ridges, crustal folding. Then, as Page’s emotion begins to burn off, the wrinkles thin and travel in a crowded bunch all the way up to her hair, like pond ripples heading for shore. And then the forehead returns to absolute unwrinkled smoothness. That is the essence of Ellen Page: the face like a doll; the gnarled sophistication of the forehead.

Photo

After ‘‘Juno,’’ Page was suddenly famous. The public performance of her life for the media became for the first time a major part of her job. She was interviewed by Oprah, whose couch seemed to render Page so nervous that she turned into a human live-blog. (Oprah: ‘‘What do you make of all this?’’ Page: ‘‘I don’t know. I’m sitting next to Oprah right now on a couch.’’ Oprah: ‘‘Now there’s all this Oscar buzz — which feels like what?’’ Page: ‘‘Um. It feels like what.’’) Page became one of the youngest-ever nominees for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. She began to see herself on magazine covers and billboards. She seemed to have crossed over an invisible threshold: from a normal, local human being into some kind of globalized fame cloud whooshing around the ionosphere.

Page clung to her privacy, and her self-protection had a special edge. She had known for a while that she was attracted to women. But she wasn’t entirely comfortable with how to place that fact in the world. Juno, in her hoodie and her Chuck Taylors, with her messy ponytail and whimsical pipe, was a hipster dream girl who, in many ways, resembled Page herself. But Juno was also explicitly heterosexual. The film’s opening sequence features her mounting her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) — sex she describes, to a friend, as ‘‘magnificent.’’ Later in the film, Juno says she might give the baby to ‘‘a couple nice lezbos’’ and, with a sour face, dismisses the name Madison as ‘‘gay.’’ Hollywood, despite widespread accusations of liberal bias, has always been powerfully heteronormative, and Page, now that she was in the system, was ushered into a tradition that had reigned for decades, the sexy young ingénue with smoldering eyeliner and spilling cleavage — a slow-motion striptease performed, over months and years, in magazines like GQ and Maxim, complete with hot dating rumors and paparazzi beach pics. Page was expected to walk red carpets, to model and discuss the kind of fashion that has creeped her out since childhood: dresses, purses, heels. For two years after Juno, she made FHM’s list of the ‘‘Sexiest 100’’ women. But she didn’t play along, and soon she dropped out.

Page was born and raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia, about as far as you can get (geographically, historically and spiritually) from Hollywood. The city’s downtown wraps around a central hill; its North End was largely destroyed by a freak explosion nearly 100 years ago. The harbor is occasionally punctuated by breaching whales. A few years after Page was born, in 1987, Nova Scotia’s fishing industry hit a hard spell. The region still has one of the highest unemployment rates in Canada.

Page’s parents — a schoolteacher and a graphic designer — divorced when she was a baby; she has no memory of them together. She grew up moving, every two weeks, from one house to the other. Page does not appear vexed by this arrangement, which seems to have been civil, supportive and stable.

As far back as Page can remember, she was a tomboy. She loved street hockey, Sega Genesis games, snowboarding and wrestling with her stepbrother. She wore her hair so short that people often called her ‘‘Allen.’’ At McDonald’s, when Page ordered a Happy Meal, she would always ask for the boy toy — the cashiers sometimes ignored her and gave her some kind of Barbie-style doll instead, whose hair she would immediately cut off. In her teens, she dated boys, but when she kissed them she felt nothing. It wasn’t until the end of high school, when Page finally kissed a girl, that she realized why humankind was obsessed with romance. She started dating other girls, but didn’t advertise the fact. She devoted herself to soccer, acting and schoolwork. In high school, she wrote a long paper about the absurdity of a binary gender system.

Page got her first big acting break when she was 10. A local actor named John Dunsworth was scouting Halifax’s elementary schools for talent. When he approached the drama coach of the Halifax Grammar School — a prestigious private institution on the south end of town — he heard about a remarkable little girl who had recently played the lead in the school’s production of ‘‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.’’ Dunsworth, who is now 69, still remembers the story: All the other kids brought their script to the first day of rehearsals, the drama coach told him, but this little girl left hers behind — she had memorized it. ‘‘So she was a committed little thing,’’ Dunsworth told me. This was the beginning of Page’s career: ‘‘Pit Pony,’’ a local TV movie about early-20th-century Nova Scotia mining life. (You can still find footage of the young Page on YouTube saying vaguely Canadian ‘‘abouts.’’) ‘‘Pit Pony’’ led to a whirlwind of local productions, which led eventually to bigger films, including the lead role in a movie called ‘‘Mouth to Mouth’’ — for which Page, at 16, playing a young anarchist, had to shave her head and travel to England, Germany and Portugal.

Acting was beginning to look like a viable lifelong pursuit, and so Page devoted herself to it completely; she decided to give up soccer and move to Toronto, more than a thousand miles from home, to attend a special program for kids with all-consuming careers: future Olympians, Drake. During this time, Page starred in a creepy indie film called ‘‘Hard Candy,’’ in which she played a teenager who traps and tortures a grown man stalking children in Internet chat rooms. It was the dark expression of the talent she would later show in ‘‘Juno’’: an innocent, seemingly vulnerable girl stepping into the world of adult sexuality — this time not quirkily, but with malevolence. That performance is what led Page to be cast, immediately after high school, in ‘‘X-Men: The Last Stand,’’ and not long after in ‘‘Juno.’’ Page wonders, sometimes, what kind of life she would be living if she had happened to be sick that day she was scouted at Halifax Grammar School. College, she thinks. Soccer.

Page doesn’t like to complain about the inconveniences of her glamorous fame. But that doesn’t change the fact that, at the height of her post-‘‘Juno’’ success, she was suffering. She felt thoroughly alienated — living in Los Angeles, far from home, famous almost overnight, and closeted. Instead of going on some kind of Angeleno child-star bender, Page removed herself: She traveled to rural Oregon to study permaculture at an eco-village called Lost Valley — a place that was not quite off the grid, but close. Residents slept in rustic dorms, with sheets hanging down as walls; they shoveled goat feces, trudged through mud and urinated in buckets.

At Lost Valley, Page met Ian Daniel, an affable, blue-eyed, red-bearded gay man from Indiana, five years older than Page, who had come to Oregon after traveling the country in a school bus powered by vegetable oil. Page recognized him immediately as a kindred spirit; she describes the moment he walked into her permaculture class as love at first sight. Daniel concurs. ‘‘We’re not lovers,’’ he told me. ‘‘We’re not in love. But it is kind of a love story.’’ When Daniel met Page, he hadn’t seen ‘‘Juno.’’ This made him the rare person who didn’t know the actress, first and foremost, as Juno MacGuff.

When he first saw Page, Daniel told me, he was ‘‘struck by how sort of average she was.’’ He had heard she was a movie star, but she was dressed ‘‘like any other young hippie on the commune’’ — jeans and hoodie. Something about her intrigued him, however. ‘‘She emanated this power,’’ he told me. It seems to have been something like the quality she showed at the Iowa State Fair: a quiet, focused, confident seriousness.

At Lost Valley, Page and Daniel talked about being gay in a predominantly straight culture, about the pressure Page felt at having to wear dresses and heels and hide her girlfriends from the press. Page returned to Hollywood after a month, and fell into a depression. Her role in “Inception”— in which she played a character named Ariadne, the architect of Leonardo DiCaprio’s convoluted action-adventure dream worlds — introduced her to a new audience, raising her profile and putting even more pressure on the fault line between public and private life. But her conversations with Daniel, among other friends, had helped sow the seeds of her future life: her public coming out, the fight for L.G.B.T. rights, the making of ‘‘Gaycation’’ (which Daniel would co-host) and ‘‘Freeheld,’’ the first film in which Page has played a gay character. At the Toronto film festival this year, she walked down the red carpet with her girlfriend, wearing a black suit.

Many of Page’s films have been about splitting the atom of the nuclear family: the fallout that occurs when parents or children fail or refuse to fill expected roles, the ways everyone can survive and build something new. Even the ‘‘X-Men’’ films, in which exceptional mutants attempt to reach an equilibrium with the ‘‘normal’’ humans around them, are practically an allegory of gay life in a straight culture. How do we build a close, supportive community out of outcasts? How can people in unorthodox situations improvise some measure of stability?

‘‘Freeheld’’ is another entry in this tradition. It is based on the true story of a landmark fight for equality in New Jersey: a police detective, dying of cancer, who asks that her pension go to her life partner. (The women have a civil union but can’t be legally married.) This request is met by bigoted resistance that must be righteously overcome. ‘‘Freeheld’’ has been a passion project of Page’s for many years. She wept when she first saw a documentary about the story, and has since guided the film through all its various phases. The final product is a pure declaration of justice, an unapologetic ‘‘issues’’ movie. Although the battle depicted is relatively new in the story of civil rights, the film itself feels strangely generic: Hollywood heroism, broadcast in bright colors and clear moral lines, with simple maps of who is right and who is wrong. It lacks some of the driving curiosity and insistent intelligence that makes Page, in person, so interesting.

Back in Iowa, a few hours after the Ted Cruz pork-chop showdown, I followed Ellen Page and Ian Daniel into an air-conditioned bus parked in the middle of a huge empty lot. This was their next ‘‘Gaycation’’ interview: an evangelical Christian band called the Bontrager Family Singers — a family of 12 that had come to Des Moines to perform, that night, at Cruz’s Rally for Religious Liberty. The Bontragers live in their bus for much of the year, driving from city to city, plucking banjos and guitars, harmonizing about the gospels, ‘‘road schooling’’ the 10 children. They looked like a magazine advertisement for heterosexual procreation: handsome, clean-cut, toothy, bright-eyed and abundant. Watching them grin and chat, I felt as if I were watching a black-and-white film that had been colorized.

It was unclear if the Bontragers realized what ‘‘Gaycation’’ was about. They talked affably for a while about the logistics of life on the road, then a little less affably about the current state of America. The father said that the country had turned away from God, that Obama was anti-Christian, with a socialist agenda, and that Ted Cruz was the most inspiring presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan. In fact he said — and here his voice took on an air of confidentiality — Cruz was actually more inspiring than Reagan.

After a while, the ‘‘Gaycation’’ hosts turned the conversation to the reason for their visit. How did the Bontragers feel about L.G.B.T. issues? What would the parents do, for instance, if one of their children turned out to be gay? The father said he had never thought much about it. He guessed that people living this lifestyle made up no more than 1 or 2 percent of the total population. Page said the number was actually 10 percent, probably higher. There was an awkward silence, during which the father simply grinned.

Page was quiet for long stretches of this conversation. She looked deadly serious. I wondered if she was seething, too angry to speak. During difficult interviews, Daniel told me, he and Page often fall naturally into complementary roles: Page challenges and argues, while he tries to bring everyone back together with mellow good humor. Men, in particular, Daniel said, can be thrown off by Page — the way she talks to them as equals, pushes back, refuses to give into intimidation. An anti-gay Rastafarian in Jamaica, he remembers, was so angry that Daniel felt as if he had to step in and calm him down.

When Page finally spoke on the bus, however, it was not with anger, but with deep emotion. The family had been so kind to welcome them, she said, and they seemed like good and generous people. So it was hard for her to understand why they couldn’t respect her desire to get married to someone she loves. She wanted the same things, after all, that they seemed to value so highly: a lifelong partnership, beautiful children. Page went on for a rather long time. ‘‘That’s just speaking from the heart, as a gay person, to you,’’ she ended.

There was silence. Page’s little orb of emotion sat, cool and fragile, in the center of the bus.

Finally, one of the teenage sons spoke. If gay marriage were legalized, he said, then marrying your dog could not be far behind. The father nodded. If gay marriage were legalized, he said, what would stop a grown man from marrying a 10-year-old girl?

The discussion had hit ideological bedrock, it seemed, beyond which persuasion was impossible. ‘‘We follow the Bible,’’ the father said, and added that they could probably talk about the subject for five hours straight and never agree. No one was angry, but soon the conversation petered out, and the crew left the bus. Page seemed crestfallen that she hadn’t been able to get through to these nice people.

This is what most impressed me about Page: her radical empathy. Radical because it didn’t extend only to her allies. (I was struck, even when she told me about the heartbreak of losing her final soccer game in a late comeback, that she took a moment to acknowledge the joy of the other team: ‘‘It was dope for them,’’ she said.) Page seems to believe that the ultimate good, and the strongest possible argument for tolerance, is genuine human connection. At the end of our final conversation, a nearly three-hour talk about gender fluidity, queer theory, Halifax, Kim Davis and the ripple effects of intolerance, Page summed it all up with: ‘‘Let’s all just, like, love and be chill. Right?’’

‘‘Just be chill?’’ I asked her, thinking of the arguments, riots, demonstrations, persecutions and demonizations that have dogged the history of human sexuality.

Page laughed. She was joking, slightly, and aware of how naïve this sounded. But she also meant it. So she went ahead and said it again.",REAL
Meet the American Vigilantes Who Are Fighting ISIS,"Lawton sent the page a message, and within a day a Y.P.G. representative invited him to join the fight. He had about $800 in savings. In February, he flew to Norway and then to Dubai, and from Dubai to Sulaimaniya, in Iraq. ‘‘From there I was really nervous,’’ he said. As he spoke, Lawton sipped water from his CamelBak. ‘‘I thought everyone was ISIS. I thought I was going to get kidnapped.’’ A fighter picked him up in a fake taxi and took him to a safe house where another American who was scared and lost was still hanging out, because he was so desperate to get to the front. Lawton told him to come with him, and so they went together.

Lawton arrived in Syria, was given an M-16 and in just over two weeks was participating in the offensive at Tel Hamis. ‘‘Fighting ISIS wasn’t high-profile yet,’’ he said. ‘‘Wasn’t a big deal. Easy ride to the front.’’

His nom de guerre was Heval Sharvan, but the freedom fighters called him Captain America. ‘‘I think, after this, I might want to relax and go back to work,’’ he said. ‘‘Maybe New York or maybe Miami. Well, Miami might be too chill.’’

Lawton told me about the day he killed an ISIS militant. A Kurd gave him a sniper rifle to attack an ISIS-controlled village. Lawton took a position on the roof of a building and saw an ISIS fighter with a rocket-propelled-grenade launcher running below. Lawton shot him.

‘‘The guy just exploded,’’ Lawton said. ‘‘He was just gone.’’ Lawton still had the rifle at his side, close to his body like a purse.

‘‘That was my first kill,’’ he said. ‘‘Kinda weird, but I had a nightmare that night.’’

‘‘About the militant?’’ I asked.

‘‘It’s hard to explain,’’ he said. ‘‘You know these guys are animals, but even with that knowledge … ’’ He trailed off. ‘‘You know you have to let the brain figure it out on its own,’’ he said. ‘‘He pointed the R.P.G. at me. He would have taken me and my friend. It was hard for me. Killing people, you know you are here to do it. But then, when it happens, and you see it. It’s different. He just exploded.’’

We walked together up the road toward the village. Barley fields spread for miles all around us. ‘‘A couple days later, I was good,’’ he said. ‘‘Ever since then, it’s been no problem. I just have to remember the videos.’’

He meant the videos of Foley, of the Syrian soldiers. He looked down and softened the earth with his boot. ‘‘See,’’ he said. ‘‘I have a big heart, and I never pictured myself actually doing it. I like to see the good in everybody.’’

The foreigners were sleeping in the villages, standing guard, burning trash, with no schedule and no plans. They were easy to spot. The Irishman with bright red hair and skin pale as the sky. Assorted Europeans who traveled in a pack. The Americans with too much sunscreen and gear. Some were fresh to the fight, and others had been on the ground for months.

At the village where I met Lawton, another American walked alone up a dirt road. The man was almost six feet tall, fair-skinned and balding with a goatee. He was a 48-year-old Ohioan named Avery Harrington, though the Kurds called him Cekdar. He was sweating but in good spirits. He drank noisily from a water bottle. A purple-velvet Crown Royal bag that held empty magazines dangled from his belt.

‘‘I’m 54 days over my visa stay,’’ he confessed.

Harrington was in the Marines during the first gulf war but never made it to the desert. Before arriving, he worked in the Ohio Department of Transportation as a highway technician, plowing snow in the winter. After connecting with the Lions of Rojava, he flew to Iraq in March 2015 with $10,000, body armor with steel plates, two canned hams, turkey bacon, 25 pairs of clean socks and 10 packets of baby wipes. He was able to cite the customs regulation — Section 126.17, Subsection F — that allowed every citizen to take one full set of body armor, including a helmet and gas mask, overseas. He paid more than $500 in baggage fees. The hams never left Iraq.

In April, when Harrington finally arrived in Syria, he was part of such a huge influx of foreign recruits that the Y.P.G. started making special units for Westerners, groups of roughly 12 soldiers. They went through a kind of boot camp called the academy. Harrington was one of seven in his class, including two other Americans, a New Zealander, an Iranian and two Brits, one of whom was an actor named Michael Enright. They trained together for just more than a week, learning to clean and dismantle Kalashnikovs. Those with more experience, like Harrington, were given PKC machine guns. Drills started at 6:15 a.m., and the men sometimes practiced blindfolded to prepare for nighttime attacks.

Why were the foreigners there? Some were escaping life back home. Others were old soldiers, trying to fill a void. A few just had delusions of grandeur. They came for the feeling of solidarity, or adventurism, or they came to fulfill a childhood fantasy, to act out some violent adolescent emotion. The youngest fighter was 19, and the oldest, I was told, was 66, a former English teacher from Canada named Peter Douglas. The veterans hoped to kill ISIS fighters and train the locals as they had been trained in the Marines or the Army. The civilians, among them a surf instructor and a philosophy student from the University of Manchester, wanted to learn what they could. They hoped their stamina was enough.

It started the same way for each of them: watching the war on television, then acting on their feelings of impotence and anger. They bought plane tickets from Philadelphia or Miami or Washington and flew solo across the Atlantic, following the orders of a Kurdish militant on Facebook who barely spoke English. It was exciting; it turned them on. They were there to help.

They crossed borders to join a de facto state run by a socialist militia with small arms, entering a battlefield where soldiers died of preventable wounds and untrained medics made tourniquets from broomsticks and torn blankets. The veterans had more experience with weapons than the Y.P.G., who fought with light infantry and without Kevlar. As one foreigner said, of a Kurdish unit, ‘‘I wouldn’t play paintball in that outfit.’’ These Westerners were genuinely brave, and yet the will to do good was not enough. The mind-set of the Y.P.G., some realized, had little to do with their own beliefs. “This is the Twilight Zone,” one said. “Lovely fairy tale,” said another. Many realized, far too late, that this wasn’t a normal deployment. Ad hoc organization, no advanced weaponry, no Black Hawk to airlift them to safety, few translators. They had abandoned everything — jobs, children, wives.

Some fought in combat, but many did not. What followed were purposeless days, sleepless nights, and I sensed a bit of humiliation among them. Like Marlow on his way up the Congo, these men seemed to experience a disturbance in their Western consciousness. They had vastly overestimated their use. Their service was respected but insignificant. These were men who arrived with a stark idea of good versus evil, who thought of themselves as heroes, and found themselves turning in circles.

‘‘We perpetually give,’’ Harrington said. ‘‘And we are perpetually getting screwed.’’

In the months after the first volunteers arrived in the fall of 2014, the foreign fighters battled ISIS alongside the Y.P.G., but then they started dying. By the summer, at least six foreigners had been killed, including one American. The Kurds started using the foreigners for safer tasks — to secure remote outposts or cover guard shifts in rear areas.

Jordan Matson, a 29-year-old Wisconsin man who ran the Facebook page at first, was among the few who continued to join the most dangerous missions. He said he was the second foreign fighter to arrive. He had been in Syria’s Kurdish territory for almost a year and was the darling of the Western militia movement. He was so popular that one woman, writing on Facebook, threatened to kill herself if he didn’t marry her. Another, he said, tried to travel to Syria with her child to ask for his hand in marriage.

I met Matson while he was taking a break from sniper duty. We were in the basement of an apartment building in Tel Tamer, a ghost town with closed storefronts and dogs with cut-off ears. Matson was over six feet and had a big jaw, a goatee and a childish grin. He wore full fatigues and carried a Kalashnikov. I asked if he had time to talk. Yes, he said — he had nothing to do. ‘‘If I have no one to play chess with, then I’m going to stare at that wall,’’ he said. ‘‘And then I’m going to stare at that wall. And when I’m done staring at that wall, I’m going to stare at that wall.’’ Matson asked if I wanted any doughnuts or soda. He was going to get something from a man down the street who worked at the only operating store in town. ‘‘I have lots of money,’’ he said. He wouldn’t say where the money came from except a ‘‘generous benefactor.’’ Harrington told me the foreigners were given a monthly allowance of about $100 for their services from the Y.P.G., which they used for extra food and toilet paper.

Before the war, Matson had never been outside the United States. He was working the third shift at a meatpacking plant in Wisconsin. He joined the Army and served for a year and a half before being discharged. ‘‘Hey, we think you have PTSD,’’ he said his superiors told him. He added, ‘‘But I don’t.’’ He was going through a divorce at the time; he later decided he had an emptiness in his life because he hadn’t deployed.

In June 2014, after the fall of Mosul, he learned on Facebook about an American named Brian Wilson. Wilson was in Rojava, fighting ISIS. They connected online, and Wilson gave him his contacts and suggested a flight route. That same month, Matson flew to Poland, then Turkey, and then drove to a town on the Turkish border. There, a Y.P.G. fighter picked him up in a fake taxi and drove Matson into Iraq. They stayed in Erbil and moved around safe houses; Matson pretended to be a doctor. They traveled deep into the mountains until they were able to cross the Tigris River at night into Syria.

Things happened quickly for him. There was no training and no induction. Matson joined a sniper unit. The soldiers’ job was to attack a group of ISIS militants who were firing mortars at a Christian police station. It was a six-hour firefight. A Y.P.G. fighter died in a suicide bombing. Matson was hit by a grenade and injured his foot. An ambulance ferried him to the regional hospital in Serekaniye.

It was there, bored during his recovery, that he worked on a page to recruit foreigners to the Y.P.G.: the Lions of Rojava. The banner was an image, altered with Photoshop, of foreign fighters. They were holding guns on a hilltop next to a giant lion; behind them was the smoke of ruined towns. It was news to most everyone that there was a Western-friendly faction in Syria. So many queries came in from veterans and nonveterans that he couldn’t deal with them.

Matson passed on the responsibility for the page a while ago. Kurdish Y.P.G. supporters run it and provide directions to prospective fighters on how to apply: Simply submit a résumé and statement of purpose. So far, Matson says, he has met about a hundred foreign recruits, but no one keeps track of the numbers.

Because of the language barrier, the foreigners couldn’t communicate well with the Kurds who were supposed to manage them. Conflicts between difficult personalities were allowed to fester. There were stories about drifters and lunatics. A British man who petted the dead ISIS bodies. Another who used his psychic abilities to hear ISIS fighters speak. One man requested to go home because of a bad case of attention-deficit disorder. Another said he understood what ISIS wanted and sympathized with their cause. Another was known for looking around and saying, ‘‘Did the C.I.A. send you?’’

When Michael Enright, the British actor who trained with Harrington, joined the foreign fighters, he became a source of controversy. Enright is best known for his role as a deckhand in ‘‘Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest.’’ He also played Nick Libergal in Season 1 of ‘‘Law & Order: L.A.’’ (In the show, the police find Libergal dead in a bathtub, his body dissolving in quicklime.) Enright had wanted to fight in the war on terror after Sept. 11, but his friends discouraged him. The rise of ISIS offered him a second chance.

Matson wanted Enright off the battlefield. He described Enright as ‘‘mentally unstable’’ in a Facebook post. ‘‘Enright is a liability,’’ Harrington told me. ‘‘He’s not just a danger to himself, he is a danger to everybody out here.’’ The actor was considered reckless with weapons, disassembling his Kalashnikov without checking that the magazine was empty. At a meeting, Harrington asked who wanted Enright kicked out of the class. Everyone raised his hand. After training, Harrington said, their commander decided to keep Enright at the front but without a fighting role. He wasn’t welcome in any unit. (When I later asked him about the comments, Enright said he did fight but didn’t want to get into any of ‘‘the gossip’’: ‘‘I think it helps ISIS. I hate ISIS.’’)

When Enright was ostracized during training, ‘‘the last thing he told me was this,’’ Harrington said. ‘‘ ‘Hope you don’t get a bullet in your head, bro.’ I thought, Dude, if we see you on the front lines, we’ll put a bullet in your head.’’

The dead man in the village was lying on his back with his arms crucified, his lower half twisted. It looked as if someone had stuck a plum in his eye socket and left it to rot. The bomb tore a hole through his pants but preserved his bright blue boxer briefs. His head was tilted slightly back, and his upper lip had slid toward his nose, leaving him with a permanent snarl.

‘‘I’ve seen more dead bodies working for the Department of Transportation in Ohio,’’ Harrington said.

‘‘This is my first,’’ I said. Harrington admitted it was his first in Syria.

‘‘Someone stole his sandals!’’ he said. ‘‘He had trekking sandals on yesterday.’’

We hung out by the body for a while. Then Harrington decided to walk back to the village center for water. A truck rolled up carrying crates packed with flatbread and tomatoes on the vine. The soldiers gathered around the truck and ate the tomatoes like apples.

‘‘I hate this,’’ Harrington said. He was looking at the tomato he got for lunch. ‘‘I love rib-eye. As soon as I leave here, it’s big old steak time.’’ He had lost a lot of weight since he arrived, and he showed me the Leatherman he used to poke new holes in his belt, which tracked the progress of his diminishing waist.

‘‘You know what I want,’’ he said. ‘‘I want this to be a seasonal job. Go plow snow in the winter and fight ISIS in the summer.’’

We finished our tomatoes, and Harrington started talking about how the Kurds always threw rocks at the stray dogs. He said another fighter almost shot someone over it the night before.

‘‘Who’s that?’’ I asked

‘‘He’s the guy with the Mohawk. He’s from San Antonio.’’ He pointed to a man with a sunburned scalp, who was crouching and barely visible in the shade of a collapsed building. ‘‘That Texan has been here a bit too long. Decent guy, but doesn’t know how to take a grain of salt. This is their country, play by their rules. Don’t let [expletive] upset you. You can yell, scream and get mad, and all you are doing is raising your blood pressure.’’

The Texan asked that I refer to him by his warrior name, Azad. He wore Oakleys and a calculator watch. He had sold his gun collection to pay for the trip to fight ISIS. He seemed disappointed in the whole journey. ‘‘I was driving a truck for the oil fields when I decided to come out here. I got a job as a brick mason to try to get in shape. But it’s frustrating,’’ he said. ‘‘The arrogance of the Kurds. They don’t know little things that could be done to save their lives.’’ He spoke in a sorrowful monotone.

He had expected to be able to train the Y.P.G. But the Y.P.G. didn’t care. They didn’t need a Texan coming to their country to explain how to fight. Instead, they kept him on guard duty. Once they even told him to drive an ambulance.

‘‘Came all the way over here for nothing,’’ he said. ‘‘Seems like such a waste of my life. I’ll never get the security clearance to go work the oil fields again. They will do a background check, and Homeland Security won’t like that I’m in a foreign militia. Work your whole life, finally get to the point where you’re making good money and blow that aside to do the right thing, and then when you get here, your hands are tied. It’s a no-win situation. If you go home, you will hate yourself the rest of your life, because maybe you could have made a difference.’’

To escape the heat, we walked through some weeds to the shade of a ruined home. ‘‘I wouldn’t go in there very far,’’ he said. The home was about to collapse. It was full of the detritus of someone else’s life. Scattered about the dirt were sticks and rotting clothes, the occasional gleam of a wedding photograph.

‘‘The people who lived here left with only their clothes on their backs,’’ he said. ‘‘A lot didn’t make it out alive. I get choked up. Then you find out the Kurds are looting and stealing. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve taken things from houses. Food, rope, cellphones. Only reason I’m here now is to kill daesh’’ — a derogatory word for ISIS fighters. ‘‘You know what they do.’’

Azad and I stepped away from the house and onto the road. It was around 4 in the afternoon. Up the road to our right, a group of Kurds next to a supply truck was yelling and grabbing at Harrington and another foreigner.

‘‘Oh,’’ Azad said. ‘‘That guy.’’

It was Michael Enright. He had been on the truck and had come to talk to Harrington about bad-mouthing him in a Facebook post. Harrington, a large man, put his arm around Enright, who was much smaller.

They screamed at each other, but I couldn’t hear the words. Enright rammed his head into Harrington’s face. Harrington swung his arm for a punch but missed. The Kurds started the engine. Enright ran and jumped into the truck bed. They drove off, and Enright stared out at us like a dog.

Harrington ran down the hill. He was screaming and cursing. ‘‘It’s the [expletive] British guy. He [expletive] head-butted me,’’ he said. A tooth had cut cleanly through his lip. A rope of red saliva dangled from his mouth. ‘‘He shouldn’t have tried to be a fighter,’’ he said. ‘‘Piece of [expletive], danger to everybody!’’

The fight seemed to disturb Azad. The threat of the Islamic State loomed over us, but the dramas of private life continued to take center stage. ‘‘Give up everything to come out here, and you’ve got these guys,’’ Azad said. ‘‘They come here for personal reasons. Just trying to make themselves look good back home. They are out here playing games and risking lives.’’

Azad wandered off and sat down on a rock across from the dead body. He pointed at it and waved his hands. ‘‘Yeah we got daesh here for an interview. Hey, yeah, why you go rape and murder women and children? You just executed a 3-year-old?’’ The Kurds near him were laughing. He kept saying it. ‘‘Hey want to interview a daesh? Daesh here!’’

He wouldn’t stop, so I asked the corpse if he had anything to say. Azad smiled and spoke for the dead man. ‘‘It’s not that bad,’’ he said. ‘‘Not that bad being dead.’’

I walked with Harrington to a neighboring village, where I would meet a driver who would take me out of Syria. Clay Lawton was there, along with an Estonian, a Dutchman and a Spaniard. I said my goodbyes and left. During the drive, a flat tire stranded us on the bank of a river, and Lawton poked his head over the truck bed. ‘‘Just catching a ride,’’ he said. ‘‘Mind if I go with you guys?’’

We rode in the bucket of a bulldozer across the river and then crawled up a wet bank and entered a field of yellow barley. A thin road cut through the field, and we hiked it.

‘‘See that village over there?’’ Lawton said. He pointed to a pile of concrete. ‘‘That’s where I shot the guy. Yeah, ISIS is right there,’’ he said. ‘‘We should probably not be standing here since we’re within sniper range. They’re probably looking at us right now. There still might be some ISIS guys left.’’

A white cloud rose from the dead fields. ‘‘Oh, yep, that’s an airstrike. That means there are still some guys right there.’’

He dragged his arm up and pointed. Neither of us had slept much, and so we didn’t make the effort to move.

Another driver waited for us at the end of the road. Lawton jumped in the van. ‘‘Where exactly do you want to go?’’ I asked.

‘‘Doesn’t matter,’’ he said. ‘‘Just take me to America, or a combat zone.’’

His plan was to change into civilian clothing and cross the border into Iraq. But when we looked in his duffel, he had only fatigues. We made one more stop, at the same location where he was first abandoned by his unit. After discussing the plans, we decided that the political situation was too tense to bring him across the border.

Lawton started dropping his belongings on the ground: camouflage shirts, a bundle of tank tops in a plastic bag. He would find a way out on his own, he said, and wanted to lighten his load. I headed back to the truck and looked back to see Lawton, alone again on the hill. His clothes made a small trail behind him in the dirt.",REAL
How Ned Yost Made the Kansas City Royals Unstoppable,"Mitchel Lichtman, an author and a former professional gambler who has consulted for the Cardinals and Astros (coincidentally, the F.B.I. is investigating the former for hacking the latter’s database and stealing information), says that the statistics are unambiguous: not bringing Holland into a situation like that of the Detroit game is bad managing. ‘‘It’s a mistake,’’ he insisted to me. Lichtman is vexed by the decisions managers make in almost every game he watches, but he feels particular disdain for Yost. He explained away Yost’s success with the Royals by saying: ‘‘There’s so much luck involved in short-term success. Even a .500 team, I could show you very easily, can win 90 games and then 12 or 15 in the playoffs on luck.’’

Lichtman’s is just one voice in a loud chorus. Because of Yost’s apparent obliviousness to data-based thinking, he has become the most criticized manager in baseball. The reach of social media and the herd mentality that pervades it may make him the most criticized manager ever. The criticism occurs not merely at the margins, in bars and man caves and on Twitter and fan websites (where the verb ‘‘Yosted’’ has emerged to describe what happens when his choices lead to a Royals loss), but squarely in the media mainstream. It fixates on Yost’s batting orders, his team’s tendency to bunt and steal, the way he handles his pitching — nearly everything that can be plugged into a formula and rendered as a number. The Chicago Tribune has suggested that Yost is ‘‘a bumbling idiot.’’ A Wall Street Journal headline referred to him as a ‘‘dunce.’’ Pedro Martinez, a Hall of Fame pitcher and TV commentator, disparaged one of his decisions in the playoffs last year as ‘‘another panic move.’’

Yet Yost keeps winning. Last fall, after sweeping their first eight playoff games, the Royals pushed the San Francisco Giants to the final inning of the seventh game of the World Series. During the off-season, his best starting pitcher, James Shields, and his starting right fielder and designated hitter departed for other teams — and still Yost led the Royals to their first division title since 1985. Despite inconsistent starting pitching and a ligament injury that recently ended Holland’s season, they begin the playoffs in position to reach the World Series for a second consecutive year, something the team has never accomplished in its 47-season history.

Yost, who is 61, has managed the Royals since 2010. Before that, he managed Milwaukee from 2003 to 2008. Since joining the Brewers, he has presided over just five winning seasons, including 2015, and was fired during one of them before it ended. But he also transformed perennial losers, from baseball’s smallest two markets, into contenders. ‘‘He took a franchise that had not been to the playoffs in 25 years, built it up and got it to the playoffs,’’ Doug Melvin, the executive who hired and fired Yost in Milwaukee, told me this summer. ‘‘Then he took a franchise in Kansas City that hadn’t been to the playoffs in 30 years and did the same thing. I don’t care what anyone says about him. How many managers have done that?’’

Ruddy-faced and taciturn, Yost looks like a baseball manager from a less image-conscious era, someone who might spend the game with tobacco juice dribbling down his chin. ‘‘He’s not reading psychology books,’’ says Jonah Keri, a writer for Grantland. One manager who actually does read them, the Cubs’ Joe Maddon, is widely considered baseball’s best. Maddon wears hip black-rimmed glasses and collects wine. The Yankees’ Joe Girardi, engaging and articulate, has an engineering degree from Northwestern, which presumably helps him interpret the mathematics used to capture what’s happening on the field. Brad Ausmus, who has managed the Tigers the last two seasons, studied government at Dartmouth.

Yost grew up in California’s Livermore Valley as an undersize striver seeking a sport in which he could excel. Cut from the high-school soccer team, he struggled for a semester as a 5-foot- 2 hurdler. Then he turned to baseball, which he hadn’t played since Little League. In 36 J.V. at-bats as a sophomore, he couldn’t muster a hit. Nevertheless, Yost decided he was going to play — not merely in high school, but for a living. ‘‘I just knew it,’’ he says. ‘‘When I sat down with my counselors and they said, ‘What are you going to do?’ I said, ‘I’m going to be a professional baseball player.’ And they looked at me like I was nuts.’’

Such certitude, based on no discernible foundation, has informed Yost’s decision-making processes all his life. ‘‘I often wonder, Do other people have that same feeling and then it doesn’t happen?’’ Yost told me. ‘‘Because I knew it was going to happen.’’ He made varsity, had a growth spurt, then landed at Chabot College. After he starred on a summer team, the Mets drafted him as a catcher. In 1980, he reached the majors, just as he had predicted. He seldom played, though. Over six seasons, Yost accumulated just 605 at-bats, a number that starters can exceed in a single year. He was wondering what to do next when the Braves asked if he would work with young players at their minor-league outpost in Sumter, S.C. He ended up as the manager there for three years before being hired onto Bobby Cox’s staff in Atlanta, where he remained for more than a decade as a bullpen coach and later a third-base coach.

Along the way, he cultivated an unconventional relationship with players, one that made them eager to get to the ballpark. ‘‘He’d throw a belt into the whirlpool when I was in there and pretend it was a snake,’’ recalls Eddie Perez, who was in Sumter and Atlanta with Yost. ‘‘Not many managers would do that.’’

Yost can be prickly in news conferences. But in an intimate setting, he’s engaging, even warm. One afternoon this summer, he shared memories with me about a friend he considered a mentor, the car racer Dale Earnhardt, whom he met through a common friend in the early 1990s. Yost wears his No. 3 to honor Earnhardt, who died in a crash in 2001. ‘‘We hit it off,’’ he said. ‘‘Hunted together every year.’’ In 1994, when a labor dispute truncated the baseball season, Earnhardt invited Yost to travel with him on the Nascar circuit and serve as ‘‘rehydration engineer’’ (in other words, water-fetcher). At one race, Earnhardt roared back from a huge deficit and nearly won. When Yost congratulated him, Earnhardt grabbed him by the shirt and pulled his friend nose to nose. ‘‘Never, ever, let anybody who you’re around, anybody you’re associated with, allow you to settle for mediocrity,’’ Yost says Earnhardt told him.

Later, Yost would be criticized for not replacing erratic infielders when he had late-inning leads and allowing untested pitchers to compete — and often fail — in crucial situations. The critics didn’t understand, he told me, that he wasn’t necessarily trying to win those games. ‘‘The difference between 72 and 76 wins doesn’t mean a damn thing to me,’’ he says. It was the same as the difference between second place and last place, which, Earnhardt had stressed, was no difference at all.

‘‘I wanted to put those young players in a position to gain experience, so that when we could compete for a championship, they’d know how,’’ Yost says. ‘‘You can’t do that when you’re pinch-hitting for young guys. You can’t do it when you quick-hook starting pitchers. They’ll never learn to work themselves out of trouble. People would say, ‘What’s he doing?’ They didn’t understand. I’d rather lose a game on my watch so they could win later.’’

In Milwaukee, Yost was hired by Doug Melvin to nurture a group of young players learning to be major leaguers. He inherited a 56-win team, the worst in franchise history, and a legacy that was equally dismal: The Brewers hadn’t fielded a winning team in more than a decade. In their first two seasons under Yost, they won just 68 and 67 games. But in 2007, they remained in contention until the season’s final week before finishing 83-79, narrowly missing the playoffs. That week, an increasingly agitated Yost was ejected from games three times for arguing with umpires. The consensus was that he’d cracked under the pressure.

The next year, the Brewers were 16 games above .500 with two weeks remaining in the season, but they were in a terrible slump, having lost 11 of 16 games and prompting talk of another collapse. Yost was fired. The Brewers wound up winning 90 games but would be remembered as the playoff team that dumped its manager down the stretch.

The knock on Yost as an unsteady hand returned last fall, after the Royals qualified as one of the two American League wild-card teams. In the elimination game against Oakland, Shields held a 3-2 lead after five innings. Then he allowed a single and a walk to start the sixth. Yost had Herrera, Davis and Holland, but as usual they were earmarked for the seventh, eighth and ninth. Instead, he turned to Yordano Ventura, a 23-year-old starter who worked as a reliever once all season and threw 73 pitches two days before.

‘‘The conventional way is to bring in Herrera early,’’ says outfielder Jonny Gomes, who was playing for Oakland at the time. ‘‘He did it a different way. He had a young guy come in with tons of emotion, which young guys typically can’t control. Knowing that, our approach was patience.’’

The criticism of Yost, on television and online, began when he lifted Shields. Then Brandon Moss hit a three-run homer, giving Oakland the lead. When Yost left the dugout to replace Ventura, the reaction from the home fans was hostile, bordering on homicidal. For 29 years, they had longed for the playoffs. Now, it appeared, the obduracy of an already unpopular manager was ending the Royals’ postseason before it had barely begun. Their frustration manifested itself in a deafening outpouring of disapproval. ‘‘I’d never in my life heard anything like it,’’ says the broadcaster Ryan Lefebvre, whose father, Jim, played and managed in the major leagues.

‘‘It didn’t bother me,’’ Yost told me. ‘‘I still felt like we were going to win the game. I had no doubt that we would.’’ They did, in 12 innings. Then they swept their series against the Angels and the Orioles.

Yost arrived in Kansas City in 2010 with the mandate to develop young talent as he did in Milwaukee. Dayton Moore, the Royals’ general manager, worked with Yost in Atlanta. He dismisses the end of Yost’s tenure with the Brewers as irrelevant. ‘‘There’s so much more to managing a baseball team than what’s happening on the field,’’ Moore says. When the Royals’ losses mounted, Moore didn’t flinch. ‘‘A lot of people were saying we needed to make a change,’’ he says. ‘‘It never crossed my mind.’’

Moore had spent enough time in the clubhouse to notice how Yost and his charges interacted. Yost, it turned out, had hardly changed since Sumter. Instead of data points to be plugged into an equation, he treated players with sportive affection, like favored nephews. ‘‘I love these guys,’’ Yost told me. ‘‘I really love them. You have to, in order to understand them. And you have to understand them in order to manage them. If you understand their backgrounds, why they are the way they are, you can understand what motivates them.’’",REAL
Is Cultural Appropriation Always Wrong?,"Photo

It’s a truth only selectively acknowledged that all cultures are mongrel. One of the first Indian words to be brought into English was the Hindi ‘‘loot’’ — ‘‘plunder.’’ Some of the Ku Klux Klan's 19th-century costumes were, of all things, inspired in part by the festival wear of West African slaves; the traditional wax-print designs we associate with West Africa are apparently Indonesian — by way of the Netherlands. Gandhi cribbed nonviolence from the Sermon on the Mount.

We sometimes describe this mingling as ‘‘cross-pollination’’ or ‘‘cross-fertilization’’ — benign, bucolic metaphors that obscure the force of these encounters. When we wish to speak more plainly, we talk of ‘‘appropriation’’ — a word now associated with the white Western world’s co-opting of minority cultures. And this year — these past several months alone — there has been plenty of talk. In film, there was the outcry over the casting of the blonde Emma Stone as the part-Chinese Hawaiian heroine of Cameron Crowe’s ‘‘Aloha.’’ In music, Miley Cyrus wore dreadlock extensions while hosting the V.M.A.s and drew accusations of essentially performing in blackface — and not for the first time. In literature, there was the discovery that Michael Derrick Hudson, a white poet, had been published in this year’s Best American Poetry anthology under a Chinese pseudonym. In fashion, there was the odd attempt to rebrand cornrows as a Caucasian style — a ‘‘favorite resort hair look,’’ according to Elle. And floating above it all has been Rachel Dolezal, the presiding spirit of the phenomenon, the white former N.A.A.C.P. chapter president who remains serenely and implacably convinced of her blackness.

Questions about the right to your creation and labor, the right to your identity, emerge out of old wounds in America, and they provoke familiar battle stances. The same arguments are trotted out (It’s just hair! Stop being so sensitive! It’s not always about race!) to be met by the same quotes from Bell Hooks, whose essays from the early ’90s on pop culture, and specifically on Madonna, have been a template for discussions of how white people ‘‘colonize’’ black identity to feel transgressive: ‘‘Ethnicity becomes spice, seasoning that can liven up the dull dish that is mainstream white culture.’’ It’s a seasonal contro­versy that attends awards shows, music festivals, Halloween: In a country whose beginnings are so bound up in theft, conversations about appropriation are like a ceremonial staging of the nation’s original sins.

It can feel like such a poignantly stalled conversation that we’re occasionally tempted to believe we’ve moved past it. A 2013 NPR story on America’s changing demographics and the evolution of hip-hop made a case that the genre has lost its identification with race, and that young people aren’t burdened by anxieties about authenticity. ‘‘The melding of cultures we’re seeing now may have Generation X and Generation Y shaking in their boots with claims of racial ‘appropriation,’ ’’ the rapper and performance artist Mykki Blanco said in an online discussion about fashion’s debt to ‘‘urban culture.’’ ‘‘To Generation Z, I would clearly think it all seems ‘normal.’ ’’ Hip-hop culture is global culture, according to this wisdom: People of Korean descent have dominated the largest international b-boy championships; twerking is a full-blown obsession in Russia. ‘‘We as black people have to come to grips that hip-hop is a contagious culture,’’ Questlove, the drummer and co-founder of the Roots, said last year in an interview with Time magazine in which he defended Iggy Azalea, the white Australian rapper derided for (among other things) affecting a ‘‘Southern’’ accent. ‘‘If you love something, you gotta set it free.’’

But many of the most dogged critics of cultural appropriation are turning out to be the very people who were supposed to be indifferent to it. Members of supposedly easygoing Generation Z object — in droves — to Lena Dunham’s posting a photograph of herself in a mock hijab. Others argue that the cultural devaluation of black people paves the way for violence against them. ‘‘What would America be like if we loved black people as much as we loved black culture?’’ Amandla Stenberg, the 16-year-old star of ‘‘The Hunger Games,’’ asked, in her video message ‘‘Don’t Cash Crop My Cornrows,’’ which criticized pop stars like Katy Perry for borrowing from black style ‘‘as a way of being edgy.’’ In June, young Asian-Americans protested when the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, as an accompaniment to a lecture called ‘‘Claude Monet: Flirting With the Exotic,’’ invited visitors to pose next to Monet’s ‘‘La Japonaise’’ while wearing a matching kimono. And South Asian women, objecting to the fad for ‘‘ethnic’’ wear at music festivals like Coachella, continued a social-media campaign to ‘‘reclaim the bindi,’’ sharing photographs of themselves, their mothers and grandmothers wearing bindis, with captions like ‘‘My culture is not a costume.’’’

Is this just the latest flowering of ‘‘outrage culture’’? Not necessarily. ‘‘The line between cultural appropriation and cultural exchange is always going to be blurred,’’ Stenberg acknowledges in her video. But it has never been easier to proceed with good faith and Google, to seek out and respect context. Social media, these critics suggest, allow us too much access to other people’s lives and other people’s opinions to plead ignorance when it comes to causing offense. When Allure magazine offers tips on achieving a ‘‘loose Afro’’ accompanied by a photograph of a white woman, we can’t overlook how actual black women have been penalized for the hairstyle — that two years ago it was widely reported that a 12-year-old black girl in Florida was threatened with expulsion because of her ‘‘distracting’’ natural hair, and that schools in Oklahoma and Ohio have tried to ban Afros outright. We can’t forget that South Asian bindis became trendy in the mid-’90s, not long after South Asians in New Jersey were being targeted by a hate group that called itself Dotbusters, referencing the bindi, which some South Asian women stopped wearing out of fear of being attacked.

Seen in this light, ‘‘appropriation’’ seems less provocative than pitiably uninformed and stale. It seems possible that we might, someday, learn to keep our hands to ourselves where other people’s cultures are concerned. But then that might do another kind of harm. In an essay in the magazine Guernica, the Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie called for more, not less, imaginative engagement with her country: ‘‘The moment you say a male American writer can’t write about a female Pakistani, you are saying, Don’t tell those stories. Worse, you’re saying: As an American male you can’t understand a Pakistani woman. She is enigmatic, inscrutable, unknowable. She’s other. Leave her and her nation to its Otherness. Write them out of your history.’’",REAL
What Should an Ethicist Tell His Readers?,"Here’s where literary people like to bring up Franz Kafka. He asked his friend and executor Max Brod to destroy all his papers and manuscripts when he died, and we’re glad Brod didn’t. Yet there’s more to the story. Brod had warned Kafka that he would never do so — this, too, was a solemn vow — and believed that if Kafka really wanted this bonfire, he would have appointed another executor. That matters, too.

Not every request can be honored, even when the intentions are crystal clear. Sometimes a request is impossible (keep my art collection housed exactly as I have left it, and here’s $5 for the upkeep) or unlawful (the rest of my estate will endow a whites-only scholarship). Sometimes the testator was coerced or of unsound mind. On occasion, wills must be modified. But there was no obstacle to doing what your sister-in-law requested. There was a will. There was a way. The way, this bereaved mother might object, would have deprived her of a focus for her grief. But what she’s talking about is a symbol. And it seems unimaginative, knowing what her daughter wanted, not to have found something else to invest with the necessary significance. The mother’s grief deserves compassion; the daughter’s request deserved compliance.

I am a librarian at a large public university. Our library administrators, following a current fad, plan to radically ‘‘downsize’’ the library collection (i.e. throw out a lot of books). Essentially, anything in the general collection that hasn’t been checked out in the past few years is going straight to the trash-hauling bin. I believe that this poorly planned weeding project will do serious damage to a very valuable public resource and that if local researchers knew the scope of devastation underway, they would have strong objections. I have been outspoken enough about my opinion to be in hot water with said administrators. Do I have an ethical responsibility to persist in whistle-blowing? How much personal trouble am I ethically obliged to cause for myself in order to oppose an administrative decision that I believe is not just damaging to our organizational mission but stupid and wrong?

Public institutions are a public trust. Any citizen, not least a trained professional like you, has the right to ask whether those who run them are carrying out the purposes for which they’ve been chartered. It’s the public’s business, and you’re entitled to bring the force of public opinion to bear. (I take it that what you’re pointing out isn’t confidential information that you have a duty not to share.) Because this is a public organization, you shouldn’t be penalized for doing so. Universities, in particular, owe their employees wide freedom of expression, including about how they are run. You’ve justly voiced your concerns. Disquiet in the library!

But the decisions you’re talking about don’t sound morally wrong. They reflect a judgment at odds with your own; they don’t reflect corruption, abuse or a total abandonment of the institution’s pur­poses. Calling your protests ‘‘whistle-blowing’’ might be, well, just a little overblown.

As a fellow book lover, I sympathize with how you must feel in the face of the great biblioclasm that is following the explosive growth of the digital library. And I applaud the aim of getting your employers to make wiser decisions. But you don’t have a duty to keep at it once you’ve made your arguments. There’s a distribution of responsibilities in any workplace. Yours is to do your job well and to speak up when you have information relevant to your fellow workers. You’ve circulated your opinion; you’re now entitled to return it to the shelf.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Aesop’s Fables,"Photo

Parenthood, at least in my experience, won’t bear ideologies. There exists no universal system for the successful impartation of certain values to children, because each child is a kind of hydra: Both adversaries wear down your tools and multiply the problems you think you’ve solved. The only method is improvisation to the point of exhaustion. You try things, those things generally fail, the kid somehow survives, you try slightly different things, ad infinitum, ad absurdum, until the kid finally outlasts the experiment that is your care. This, after too many after-school ‘‘talks’’ that turned into terrible lectures, is what drove me to the fables of Aesop this past spring.

My daughter is 9, by now all but immune to my stilted offers of wisdom and reproof. I had just gotten engaged and moved half her life to Brooklyn, and I needed some way to let her know that, despite the changes in setting and personnel, I remained annoyingly invested in helping her figure things out. (Worry: It motivates.) In a bout of desperation, I pulled the recent Puffin Classics ‘‘Aesop’s Fables’’ ($4.99) down from the shelf and plopped down on the corner of her bed.

The 11 most common animals in Aesop’s fables, measured by the number of appearances they make in the stories’ titles: 1. Lion 2. Fox 3. Wolf 4. Donkey 5. Dog 6. Crow 7. Bull 8. Snake/Ape (tie) 10. Sheep/Eagle (tie)

Little is known about Aesop, including whether he existed at all. In some accounts, the fabulist is said to be a potbellied, cross-eyed, knock-kneed itinerant, his homeliness (as with Yoda and Socrates) perhaps the wages of otherworldly insight. In others he is a slave, an adviser to roy­alty or an annoying interloper, in each case distinguished by his way with a phrase. To nonbelievers, he’s a animal-loving catchall, just the name put to a vast collection of advice passed down and down forever.

I tend toward believing in a historical Aesop, almost entirely because of the clarity of the voice that called out to us during that first night’s encounter with the fables. It is a routine now: We lie flat on our backs atop my daughter’s warm sheets, shoulder to shoulder, my voice traveling upward toward the book spread in my hand. Skillful translation can do many things, but it can’t conjure personality where none exists. And here was Aesop, marshaling the industry of ants to teach foresight; illustrating the importance of accepting limits with a disastrously jealous donkey; embarrassing a jackdaw with borrowed feathers on the way to a lesson on leveraged debt. And like every real voice, Aesop’s manages to be both singular and familiar. Everybody knows this person, made uncommonly watchful by experience.

In Aesop’s case, maybe too watchful. A week or so into what I came to think of as ‘‘our Aesop thing,’’ I discovered — too late — the moral of the first fable of the night, ‘‘A Cartload of Mischief.’’ ‘‘The Arabs are the greatest liars and deceivers on earth,’’ I read aloud to my child, dismay gathering by the syllable. ‘‘Their tongues know not the truth.’’ That night we skipped our customary second story in favor of a talk about the unreliability of certain narrators, and the meaning of the word ‘‘xenophobia,’’ and how even the wisest among us might fall victim to its illusions.",REAL
The Politics of Pantyhose,"The modern hosiery era began with the democratization of silk stockings, which were once on the verge of seeming a contemptible extravagance. After World War I, the price dropped to put them within the reach of a middle class newly encountering the ‘‘artificial silk’’ of rayon, which on the one hand was cheap and on the other looked cheap. DuPont introduced nylon stockings at the New York World’s Fair of 1939 by presenting a model (Miss Chemistry) emerging from a test tube, her legs coated in a polymer boasting futuristic properties: ‘‘filaments as strong as steel, as fine as a spider’s web, yet more elastic than any of the common natural fibers.’’ Within two years, nylon had captured 30 percent of a market dominated by the silkworms of a bellicose Japan. During World War II, when DuPont directed its nylon toward ropes and tarps and parachutes, nylon stockings came off the market. When they reappeared, the shop-floor frenzies that followed were construed as Nylon Riots. Imagine these scrambles as the claiming of delicate peace dividends and baptismal sites of postwar consumerism.

In the long run, the customer is always right. And now the customer can increasingly afford not to be one. A woman’s clothes are not simply her own in certain professional settings. As a rule, the more male-­dominated a work environment, the more likely it is expected that women in the ranks will make a gesture toward covering their skirt-­bared legs with fabric as thin as a gesture itself. A friend who is employed by a big bank with a conservative culture (and who declines to identify herself because she would like to remain so) tells us its women are made to understand that they should wear nude hose or black hose or maybe, maybe, opaque black tights in all but the sultriest heat.

Slide Show

There are certain corners of life where pulling on a plain pair of hose remains a prerequisite for success. But more and more it is rare to find very many ‘‘fashionable’’ women cornered in them. In 2008, when Barack Obama was running for his first presidential term, Michelle Obama materialized on ‘‘The View’’ and explained that she stopped wearing panty­hose ‘‘a long time ago.’’ In legwear as elsewhere, the personal is political, and these politics were centrist and pragmatic.

The chic woman now inhabits a world in which the exposure of naked shins to the winds of February is quite the opposite of a ghastly mishap. It is a power move, one that indicates the vigor of youth and the muscle tone of Pilates and possibly further implies the brevity of a stroll from a hired car to a reserved table. Or, in the instance of legs striding through a long commute clothed only in moisturizer or self-­tanner, it is not only a novel variation on the idea that we all must suffer for beauty but also a callback to a workaround of wartime rationing — paint-on hosiery like Max Factor’s ‘‘liquid stockings.’’ The bold bareness asserts the enjoyment of an increasingly common luxury — freedom from codes of thought that are, in their way, as constraining as any corset.

Those people who find hosiery a pain are free to renounce it, while those who enjoy or endure it can indulge a multiplicity of pleasures — all the old thrills of all the old frills condensed in an ultrasheer embrace. Once, the goal of following the mode in hose was to achieve conformity; an old Hanes ad captures the ideal in its illustration of a cancan kickline, identical curves of calves receding to infinity. Now that hosiery is no longer quite so compulsory, it has been refashioned as a site of play. The browser confronts a carnival of decorative possibilities: jubilations of patterned tights and dainty plays of dots, embroidery suggesting the avant-­garde compromise of a tea cozy and a temporary tattoo. There are mass-­market numbers apparently engineered to adjust to body temperature and most definitely embellished with crystals, and there are high-end fishnets constructed with an understanding of the millimetric nuances in flirtiness. I wonder what veterans of the Nylon Riots, for whom a run in a stocking was a blot on the day, would make of the habit of wearing deliberately ripped hose to lend yourself a punk-waif atmosphere.

What was a cultural monolith fragmented into many niches, and the official language of hose gave way to a Babel of vernacular. These duds do not say the same things they did in the day before, for instance, the acceptance of leggings as trousers signaled a revision of the rules of lower-­body array. Think of the deliberate run as a manifestation of the decay of ideas of order. Women’s hose have evolved into something new and dissolved into nothing all at once, just as measured feet of poetry evolved into free verse.",REAL
Aaron Sorkin Thinks We’re All Too Mean,"Critics say today that we’re living in another golden age of television. It seems to me that your work, especially the dialogue, brings to mind the first golden age — of Alfred Hitchcock and ‘‘Playhouse 90.’’ Do you have an affinity for either era? I have an affinity for when we did live plays on television. And I think that doing something live is something that television can do that really nothing else can. It’s the shared experience.

Your shows often have these theatrical moments when everyone stops and pays attention to one character delivering a speech. It’s sort of like performing a song. Yeah, a longer piece of music like a symphony or an opera will have an allegro, an adagio, a finale ultimo and so on — the highs and lows and different speeds and moods of a piece of music make it all come together. I wish that there were a way to say that without sounding pretentious.

And I suppose your signature ‘‘walk and talks’’ are sort of like choreographed dance numbers. Actually, that was simply a way to add visual interest to a visual medium that I only really use aurally.

You don’t seem very interested in the antiheroes who have become a cliché of this era of television. Why not? I’m more comfortable writing traditional protagonists. But ‘‘Steve Jobs’’ and ‘‘The Social Network’’ have antiheroes. I like to write antiheroes as if they’re making their case to God about why they should be allowed into heaven. I have to find something in that character that is like me and write to that.

Do you think television is a force for good or evil? Some of it is bad. I don’t mean bad in its execution — it’s that, too — but I mean meanspirited, reaching for the worst in us and appealing to the worst among us. But when you can sit with your whole family and watch the presidential debates, I do think it’s a national hearth.

Do you think people find a similar shared experience over Twitter now? It feels to me like a lot of people talking and nobody listening. It’s just a little quippy for me.

East by West Indies,"Photo

At a time when a sizable chunk of the American population is debating whether immigrants are lazy sponges or job-stealing sponges, it may be refreshing to learn that Trinidad has a national holiday celebrating the arrival of Indians to its land. It was 1845, and they were workers coming to quench the country’s withering labor shortage. Of course, that ‘‘labor shortage’’ was actually how plantation owners described a result of African slaves’ winning their freedom — a thought almost as depressing as the fact that the Indians were actually indentured servants brought in to take their place. But today, Trinis are chest-thumpingly proud of their blended heritage.

Those Indians, their descendants and the waves of immigrants after them fundamentally reshaped Trini culture, music and food. So much so that, if you wandered into any random Trini restaurant, as I did at Singh’s Roti Shop in Trini-rich Richmond Hill, Queens, you could be forgiven for assuming you’d just arrived at an Indian buffet. (Well, if you somehow missed the Olympics-like procession of Caribbean flags, the accents and the D.J. who starts the party by bumping bouncy soca riddims at 9 a.m.) Everywhere you look, there are curries, rices and rotis.

Nearby, Dolly Sirju teaches Trini cooking classes in her home, through a company called the League of Kitchens. When I attended one, she welcomed us warmly but spoke with nonsense-free authority, and she didn’t want to hear any noise about her curries seeming like Indian food. ‘‘My great-grandparents moved to Trinidad from India, and Indians ask me, ‘How come you guys make the same thing we make but cook it different?’ ’’ she said before letting out a salty harrumph. ‘‘For me, India is totally different from Trinidad. I’m not fascinated by it. What we do is take a little from each culture — Indian, African, Caribbean, Chinese — and that makes it Trini.’’

Four spoonfuls into her nutty, herbal, spicy chana and aloo, I started to understand. (Actually, I got it after one bite, but I had to take three more — for journalistic purposes.) An everyday staple, the dish shares a look and a name with a typical North Indian curry: Chana means ‘‘chickpeas’’ in Hindi; aloo means ‘‘potatoes’’; the ‘‘and,’’ I assume, is a musical flourish of Caribbean English. But while Indian cooks make a gingery tomato base and grind fresh spices for their dish, Sirju’s version announces its island origins. The flavor is built on a floral wave of shado beni, a cilantro-like herb that grows wild all over Trinidad, stirred in raw and pungent and cooked down to a mellow, sweet swell. (The herb is also called culantro; if you can’t find it, you can substitute a combination of cilantro and parsley.) The stew gets a slow, building heat from fruity Scotch bonnet peppers and aroma from preground Madras curry powder, which was popularized by colonial merchants to create a British market for their spices­. All these flavors drape over soft chickpeas and potatoes to make a dish that’s particular to its homeland. It’s a rare combination of intriguing and satisfying — the kind of thing that sparks some pride. ‘‘There are a lot of Guyanese in this neighborhood,’’ Sirju said. ‘‘But if the Guyanese are having a function, they’ll ask a Trini to come cook.’’

She showed us other Trini kitchen moves: rubbing raw goat with ground cloves, then rinsing it with lemon and water to wash off its gamy taste; puréeing shado beni, parsley and scallions with water to make ‘‘green seasoning,’’ a killer flavor base, even if it sounds like a juice-bar nightmare; griddling roti flatbreads and then whacking the bejesus out of them with paddles to break open their flakes for maximal curry absorption. (The roti is called ‘‘buss-up shut.’’ It means ‘‘busted-up shirt.’’ Everything about it is amazing.)

In the backyard behind the kitchen, Sirju’s sons, clad in white tank tops, were teaching themselves how to take apart a car and put it back together: classic Americana. They disappeared for a while. Then, after hours of cooking, tons of curries and shirts being busted up, the kids came home — with a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken. I wondered if Sirju would take this as an affront — cultural decline at the drive-through. But she pulled out a bottle of Kraft barbecue sauce. ‘‘I make American food,’’ she said. ‘‘My neighbors are American, and when we’re barbecuing, forget it. The whole neighborhood is in my backyard.’’ She handed me a spoonful of the sauce. She’d warmed it with spices, sharpened it with tamarind, then napalmed it with chiles. She took it and made it Trini, made it her own. And she was proud as hell of it.",REAL
Judge John Hodgman on a Christmas Wish,"Photo

Cora writes: I think it would be entertaining for my father to dress in drag this Christmas! I would put makeup on him, dress him in a Christmas outfit and have him jump out of a present. He signed a contract I wrote that said, “I, Taylor W., will allow Cora W. to dress me as a woman this Christmas.” He is already trying to wiggle out of it. What can I do?

I admire you for your gumption, Cora. I also fear you. Obviously you know that your father is a human with dignity, not your ‘‘Twilight Zone’’-style plaything (unless you live in Park Slope, of course). Still, you were smart enough to get him to sign a contract — which is, as they say, a contract. Your father must uphold his end of it.

Yes, Cora, there really is a Judge John Hodgman. And he has come to make your strange Christmas dream come true.",REAL

What do we attend to first in a poem: music or meaning? Reading this one, I was so enthralled by the rhythm and sound that the lines carried me along before I registered what was being said — a seamless blend of content and form.

Barberism

By Terrance Hayes

It was light and lusterless and somehow luckless,

The hair I cut from the head of my father-in-law,

It was pepper-blanched and wind-scuffed, thin

As a blown bulb’s filament, it stuck to the teeth

Of my clippers like a dark language, the static

Covering his mind stuck to my fingers, it mingled

In halfhearted tufts with the dust. Because

Every barber’s got a gift for mind reading in his touch,

I could hear what he would not say. He’s sworn

To never let his hair be cut again after his daughter

His grandchild, weeps when my clippers bite

How to Hold a Stranger’s Baby,"Photo

‘‘Tell the baby your name, and say their name,’’ says Pat Rice, a psychologist who has been volunteering for 19 years as a ‘‘trained cuddler’’ in the neonatal intensive care unit at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif. You want to be in what Rice calls an ‘‘interpersonal state of mind.’’ Just be sure to wash your hands first and stay away if you’re sick.

Try to avoid feeling self-conscious or attempting to impress nearby adults. ‘‘Be more consciously in your heart when you’re holding babies,’’ Rice says. Make that tiny body in your arms your temporary nucleus. Start with the classic cradle hold, but change positions if the child cries, arches its back or looks exasperated. One of Rice’s go-to moves is to nestle a baby upright against his chest and gently pat its behind. ‘‘That seems to be almost magic,’’ he says. Newborns who receive tactile stimulation exhibit lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol and more autonomic nervous system stability. After Rice picks up a child in the NICU, he can see that calm arrive in real time on the baby’s monitor screens: The heart rate slows, and oxygen saturation levels rise. A successful encounter usually ends with a sleeping baby.

Speak and sing. Researchers have found that infants, especially premature ones, sleep more deeply after hearing music. Rice usually defaults to Louis Armstrong’s version of ‘‘When You’re Smiling’’ or a sonorous hum he calls his foghorn. ‘‘Sometimes, when a baby is very agitated or upset, I’ll just repeat: ‘You’re O.K. It’s going to be all right.’ ’’

Holding a baby gets easier with practice. Rice, who is 83, and his wife, Claire Fitzgerald, who is 81 and also a volunteer cuddler, raised five children and have 11 grandkids. They’ve held premature babies weighing just 2 pounds, cradled infants in the hours before they’re taken off life support and rocked newborns whose parents lived far from the hospital or just needed a few hours to themselves. Unfamiliar babies require a more singular focus. They don’t know you; you have to convince them you are a capable consoler. ‘‘Calm your emotions,’’ Rice says. ‘‘That way you can generate compassion, not worry or fretting.’’",REAL
The Brother Who Made It Across the Mediterranean,"I had just been so busy; there was too much going on, and we had to get everyone over to us. We concentrated on the weakest: the dehydrated children, sick people, mothers who were breast-feeding. They had had no food for days, and no water either. It was over 100 degrees on the Mediterranean, with ruthless sun and barely any wind.

The man who lost his brother was Nepalese, and they had traveled together from Nepal to Libya, mostly on foot. From there, they had heard, they could reach Europe with a smuggler.

The Nepalese man said nothing while the Pakistani recounted his journey. He just looked at me. Then he turned his head down so I couldn’t see his eyes.

After the Pakistani nodded at him, he took out a passport from his back pocket and handed it to me. It was wrapped in plastic but still wet from salt water. I tried to unfold the pages, but they stuck together, and I worried I would damage it even more, so I gave it back to him.

I understood that except for the clothes he was wearing, the passport was his only possession. I did not ask him many questions. I just said: ‘‘I’m sorry. I don’t know. But I will find out.’’

Over the radio, I reached another crew member. I practically screamed a reminder that people had died on one of the boats. The Italians, who were coordinating rescue efforts from Rome, would know where the bodies were.

Before I finished my shift, I saw the Nepalese man sitting on deck. He was by himself, and the Pakistani was nowhere to be seen. He had just lost his brother, and no one was with him.

On my next shift, six hours later, I saw him again. He was holding a map of Southern Italy and studying it intently. One of my colleagues had given him the news that his brother’s body was not going to the Italian mainland, where we were headed. It was on its way to Messina, in Sicily, with another rescue ship. He was trying to figure out the distance in between.

Crew members kept asking one another for more information on the brother’s whereabouts. One said the men’s only money had been sewn into the brother’s clothing. I spoke to the Nepalese man on one or two occasions, when food was being distributed. He was 28, and his brother had been 25. It was not clear if the man had any family, but the brother had a wife and a child at home. I told the man that I had a brother, too, that he was my closest family member. I wanted to believe he understood me.

‘‘Where are you going?’’ I asked him. ‘‘Where were you headed with your brother?’’ He did not answer, so I did not want to press him. He was grieving, and he had this aura of dignity around him. And after all, it wasn’t as if I could promise him anything; I couldn’t offer any particular help or even say that I was sure the Italians were going to do something for him. I wanted to offer him a bed, but that wasn’t possible. We cannot offer 665 beds; we have only the deck.

After about 18 hours at sea, we finally reached Taranto. The Italian authorities were lined up and waiting to receive the migrants. We made sure they knew the man was the migrant with the dead brother, and we let him get off the ship separately so that he would not get lost among everyone else.

Before he crossed the landing, I went to him and put my hand on his shoulder. ‘‘Good luck,’’ I said. He still had no shoes and that yellow T-shirt. I wondered if he had been told what the words meant.",REAL
The 9.20.15 Issue,"Rather than celebrate innovations that allow artificial-intelligence equipment to be hidden in Barbie’s ‘‘slightly thickened thighs,’’ in order to shore up falling sales quotas, the toy industry in general and Mattel in particular should work to highlight girls’ creativity, intelligence and engagement with the world around them.

There are some surprising parallels between the new Hello Barbies and today’s new electronic sex dolls. Critics of A.I. toys like Barbie fret that ‘‘for some children, synthetic friendship could begin to supplant the real kind,’’ and critics of the new ultrarealistic electronic sex dolls worry that they will supplant men’s relationships with real women. In England, there are even movements afoot to make sex dolls illegal. Will parents soon feel they are being supplanted by talking Barbies and try to ban them too? Julie Wosk, New York

RE: KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR

Jay Caspian Kang spent a peculiar day with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the former basketball star who is also a reserved intellectual.

I’ve found that the best way to get what you want to know from Kareem is to ask him. He is thoughtful, intelligent, sardonic, verbal, laugh-out-loud funny, but you won’t find that out if you treat him with passive-aggressive hostility. Nor should you. He is not comfortable with professional strangers. Chalk this up to his treatment when he was a politically aware man in his 20s being baited by the conservative old-school press. Yet even now, at ballparks, at grocery stores, in the street, when he starts signing autographs, a crowd gathers and his life is put on hold. Imagine this happening, guaranteed, every day of your life. Some people enjoy this contact, but it is not a character flaw that Kareem does not. This article is a disservice to a man of accomplishment and dignity. Peter Knobler, co-author of the Abdul-Jabbar autobiography ‘‘Giant Steps,’’ New York

He is a deep thinker, thoughtful and compassionate, and articulates his beliefs by taking the ‘‘high road.’’ With Kareem, it’s not about winning elections or popularity contests or convenient sound bites pre-scripted by handlers.

Far Away From Here,"What I wanted was an S.L.R. film camera. Sure, there was the cluttered cabinet in my New York City apartment with its eight cameras and their various lenses and filters: the Hasselblad, the Nikon, the Leica, a couple of other Canons, some cameras I hadn’t touched in years. Each sat there, the physical evidence of some previous fervor. Nevertheless, the heart wants what it wants, and about a week after arriving in Zurich, I bought an old Yashica and two lenses from a dealer near the Hauptbahnhof, for the very low and un-Swiss price of 25 Swiss francs, just a little over $25.

I loved that Yashica. During my six months in Zurich, I wrote a bit about Lagos and did a bit of other writing. But I stumbled into a surprise: The majority of my time went into traveling around Switzerland taking photographs, in all weather and at all elevations, thinking with my eyes about the country around me. The drama in these landscapes was real, and seemed almost to demand a response from the viewer.

August 2014. I’m on the Gemmipass, 2,770 meters above sea level and 670 meters above the town of Leukerbad. James Baldwin wintered in Leukerbad in the 1950s. Later he would write, ‘‘From all available evidence no black man had ever set foot in this tiny Swiss village before I came.’’ The Gemmipass is a high mountain pass that connects mountains in the canton of Valais with those in the canton of Bern. I’m hunched over the tripod, pressing the shutter every few seconds. The weather has suddenly turned. Is this rain? Fog? I wipe the lens clean. Not only am I the only black man on the pass just now, I am the only human being of any kind. It’s just me and the lake, the surrounding mountains, the rocks nearby and some signs on the hiking trail. I have the wrong shoes on, and my jacket is not waterproof. I clamber over some hillocks so that I see the reverse of a yellow trail sign, the side on which there’s no writing. The rocks on the mountain face are a beautiful scatter. The mist goes as it came, without warning. I put another roll of film in the Yashica and keep shooting.

A photo essay on London must have the Houses of Parliament or, at least, a red phone box, and one on Paris must include the Eiffel Tower. Rio de Janeiro is the statue of Christo Redentor. Entire countries are reduced to their metonyms. Kenya is a safari, Norway is fjords. And Switzerland is mountains. This is an exaggeration, but the truth in it is worth thinking about: It is a country built largely in the lee of the Alps, the towns and cities formed from old human migrations that came to rest in valleys, lake shores and, sometimes, higher regions. I had a notion: If I could understand the mountains, I could understand the country.

The Alps, Europe’s arching spine, have often been the obstacle to cross between one part of the continent and another. Hannibal’s charge in 218 B.C. from Spain to Italy was celebrated even in antiquity and would later serve as a point of comparison for Charlemagne and Napoleon. During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, many Northern European artists went to Venice and Rome, via arduous Alpine crossings, returning home changed by the art they had seen. Dürer was obsessed by the canon of human proportions, Frans Floris took on a Michelangelesque vigor, Rubens imitated Titian and, in the 17th century, the Dutch Caravaggisti plunged their styles into deep shadow and dramatic light.

But for Pieter Bruegel the Elder, who traveled to Italy in the 1550s, the major change in his art — which was unclassical before his trip to Rome and which remained unclassical after — was due to the Alps. He became a virtuoso of vertical landscapes, which were utterly alien to his native Brabant. His biographer, Karel van Mander, wrote, in 1604: ‘‘When Bruegel was in the Alps, he swallowed all the mountains and rocks and spat them out again, after his return, onto his canvases and panels.’’ Bruegel’s work was important for the development of independent landscapes: landscapes that did not need the pretext of a mythological or biblical event.

A few centuries later, the limitations of the daguerreotype meant that cityscapes and landscapes were among the earliest photographic subjects. In 1849, the great art critic and social reformer John Ruskin made what are believed to be the first photographs of the Alps. This was the age of firsts: The first photograph containing a human being, the first photographic self-portrait, the first aerial photograph, the first news photo (it showed a man being arrested). You couldn’t have your photograph taken in 1825, but by 1845, there were thousands of photos, of people, things and places. Light from the world could be fixed on a surface: It was possible to take the shadow away from the body and show it elsewhere.

There had been a powerful tradition of alpine painting, connected both to the Romantic tradition and to scientific study. But photography made the Alps newly portable. For Ruskin, they were such a staggering geological fact that he visited Switzerland repeatedly, describing what he saw with intense drawings, photographs and words: ‘‘There is indeed an appearance of action and united movement in these crested masses, nearly resembling that of sea waves; ... they seem not to be heaped up, but to leap or toss themselves up; and in doing so, to wreathe and twist their summits into the most fantastic, yet harmonious, curves, governed by some grand under-sweep like that of a tide running through the whole body of the mountain chain.’’

Others took their enthusiasm for the Alps in a more athletic direction. Some well-known mountains had already been climbed, but from the 19th century onward, at a greater rate than ever, the first ascents of dozens of major peaks were recorded. The first ascent of the Dufourspitze was in 1855, the Eiger’s in 1858, the Matterhorn’s in 1865. The ascent of the Dom, on Sept. 11, 1858, is typical in its details: The climber was the Rev. John Llewelyn-Davies, a Cambridge-­educated classicist and prominent vicar, with the help of three Swiss guides. These were difficult undertakings, and the risk involved was sufficient, in the words of one commentator, to ‘‘lend climbing the dignity of danger.”

Between 1863 and 1868, a photographer named William England produced a series of views of Switzerland and Savoy, showing lakes, roads, valleys and mountains, work he carried out under the auspices of the Alpine Club of London. And the Italian photographer and mountaineer Vittorio Sella produced, in the 1880s and ’90s, some of the most beautiful photographs ever made of the Alps, photos that later inspired in Ansel Adams ‘‘a definitely religious awe.’’ Working near the end of the 19th century, with a heavy glass-plate camera, Sella captured the cold and awesome power of the Alps with an accuracy and descriptive sensitivity that has hardly been improved on.

All the while, leisure travel itself was changing. The publishing house established by Karl Baedeker in Germany issued ‘‘The Rhine,’’ one of its first travel books in 1861. Not long after that came ‘‘Switzerland.’’ Informed about the best rails and trails, the most reliable hotels and information on local customs, an intrepid traveler could experience foreign lands without an entourage or local contacts. The Baedeker guides are tart and direct. Swiss hotels are praised: ‘‘Switzerland may be said to have a specialty for hotels; few better are to be met with in any part of the world.’’ Swiss wine is condemned: ‘‘Wine is generally a source of much vexation. The ordinary table wines are often so bad that refuge has to be taken in those of a more expensive class, which is indeed the very aim and object of the landlord.’’ But throughout Baedeker’s Switzerland, over the hundreds of pages, what impresses is the attention to detail, the almost microscopic precision with which each itinerary, town, museum, mountain range and hike is described.

Baedeker was already able to state, in that early guide to Switzerland, that places like the Rigi, the Brünig and the Scheideck were on ‘‘beaten tracks.’’ By the 1880s, Switzerland was estimated to be receiving a million visitors a year. Travelers tend to go where other travelers have gone, and perhaps this is part of the reason travel photography remains in thrall to the typical. When you do visit Zurich or Cape Town or Bangkok, they are very much alike: The amusement parks have striking similarities, the cafes all play the same Brazilian music, the malls are interchangeable, kids on the school buses resemble one another and the interiors of middle-class homes conform to the same parameters.

This doesn’t mean the world is uninteresting. It only means that the world is more uniform than most photo essays acknowledge, and that a lot of travel photography relies on an easy essentialism. I like Italo Calvino’s idea of ‘‘continuous cities,’’ as described in the novel ‘‘Invisible Cities.’’ He suggests that there is actually just one big, continuous city that does not begin or end: ‘‘Only the name of the airport changes.’’ What is then interesting is to find, in that continuity, the less-obvious differences of texture: the signs, the markings, the assemblages, the things hiding in plain sight in each cityscape or landscape. This is what outstanding photographers are able to do, and it is the target the rest of us chase.

The question I confronted in Switzerland is similar to that confronted by any camera-toting visitor in a great landscape: Can my photograph convey an experience that others have already captured so well? The answer is almost always no, but you try anyway. I might feel myself to be a singular traveler, but I am in fact part of a great endless horde. In the 1870s, Mark Twain was already complaining: ‘‘Now everybody goes everywhere; and Switzerland, and many other regions which were unvisited and unknown remotenesses a hundred years ago, are in our days a buzzing hive of restless strangers.’’

I went up many mountains in Switzerland, often jettisoning the dignity of danger for the luxury of cable cars, and took many pictures of slopes and summits. I suppose I knew, even then, that those photos would not necessarily play a central role in my project. I considered them, instead, small installments on a debt to beauty, a relief from having to be original. But beyond the mountains (this became gradually clear) lay smaller quarry: ordinary land, cityscapes, interiors. Having opened myself to the sublime experience of the Alps, it was to these I turned as I got deeper into my project. The Alps were the door, but what lay beyond, or below?

Switzerland isn’t a huge country. It is about a third the size of Alabama. I traveled all over it, and I did not tire of it, was not bored even for a moment. I went to the Bernese Oberland and Interlaken, to Graubünden in the east, to Valais in the south, to Ticino in the southeast, to Geneva, Neuchâtel, Basel, Bern, Vals. I took trains, trams, funiculars, ferries, cable cars, buses. I walked and hiked, the camera always around my neck, the tripod on my shoulder. I went to crowded places and bare ones, to night clubs and graveyards. The country is sane, clean, eye-wateringly expensive and saturated with a straightforward, unironic and inexhaustible beauty. A couple of months into the residency, I was in a mesmerized state.

Lake Zurich, bigger than expected and as clean and graceful as the city whose name it shares, is described by Baedeker as follows: ‘‘Its scenery, though with slight pretensions to grandeur, is scarcely equaled in beauty by any other lake.’’ But I found Lake Zurich’s equal at Lake Brienz, which in summer is a turquoise color of hypnotic clarity and is ringed by steep green cliffs that, in winter, threaten the small villages along the shore with avalanches. In fact, the problem I encountered was that each lake in Switzerland was the most beautiful, if it happened to be the one you were on.

Lake Geneva feels fully enfolded into civilization and has the air of the grand hotels from the 1950s. Lake Neuchâtel is compact, with fine vineyards nearby that make you think of France. Lake Lugano is warm and joyful, a page taken from the Mediterranean, and it slyly extends into Italy. Lake St. Moritz, Lake Silvaplana and Lake Sils are pure and clear, the elongated splatter of the three of them visible from the mountains of the Upper Engadine as clearly as on a map. Lake Lucerne — the Vierwaldstättersee, the Four Forested-­Cantons Lake — is the most mysterious of them all, a fjordlike lake, full of fog and silhouettes, inlets and outcroppings and an extremely complicated coastline that spreads, as the name says, across four cantons. In the mountains and towns around all these lakes, days pass by like the hours of a dream. Travel, mountains and photography lock together in dream logic.

But ambition always comes to darken your serenity. Technically proficient mountain pictures were good, but I also had to develop my own voice. In photography, as in writing, there’s no shortcut to finding that voice. I could not decide ahead of time that I would take only ugly pictures or only beautiful ones, or that everything would be in focus or blurred, or that I would use only color or only black and white. I had been thinking about landscape, I had been exploring color film for a few years, I was drawn to abstraction, and a certain gentle surrealism to be found in the attitude of objects. But there then followed a situational focus, a sensitivity to what the environment gave me.

Out of this focus, many pictures emerged, most of which didn’t quite work. But I also started to intuit my ley lines. As I shot more and more, I saw that I was drawn to signs, to mirrors in the landscapes (in Switzerland, there are rectangular mirrors at many street crossings, which frame the landscape behind you above the one you are facing), to maps and globes, to mountains as well as to pictures of the mountains in billboards and posters. I noticed — proof perhaps that we cannot help thinking of mountains photographically, the way we cannot help thinking of explosions cinematically — that some of my photographs of mountains looked like photographs of photographs of mountains. I was drawn to this shimmering partition between things and the images of things.

I became less interested in populating my images and more interested in traces of the human without human presence. I used deep shadows less frequently than I had in the past. I pretty much ceased nocturnal shooting. As the sequence began to take shape, I got a better sense of what belonged and what didn’t. I was studying photographs constantly, but I also immersed myself in the rhythms of certain painters and collagists: Chardin, Matisse, Rauschenberg, Mehretu, Mutu. I let go of some ‘‘good’’ photos, the way you strike out pretty sentences from a draft, and I learned how a number of tightly argued photos should be followed by one or two that are simpler and more ventilated. Authorship, after all, is not only what is created but also what is selected.

Along the way, I felt the constant company of doubt: my lack of talent, my impostor’s syndrome, my fear of boring others. Every once in a great while, there was finally a superb picture, but when I looked at it the following week, I would see that it actually wasn’t very good: too obvious, too derivative. Three thousand photographs and three thousand doubts.",REAL
Jorge Ramos’s Long Game,"It was a remarkable exchange, and the optics of it weren’t entirely accidental. Ramos arrived almost two hours early to grab a seat in the front row while his team set up two cameras: one to film Trump and one to film Ramos. Even before Trump entered the room, Ramos knew he would stand up when he asked his question. He’d studied Trump, he told me, and noticed that it was easier for Trump to silence reporters when they were sitting down. He also wanted to be equal to Trump, visually, and to be miked separately so that, for his audiences at least, his voice would be as loud as Trump’s.

When I suggested that such preparations turned the news into a kind of contrived performance, Ramos countered that performance was very different from acting. Television news, he argued, can’t be wholly improvised. Flights need to be booked. Press passes must be requested and approved. “TV doesn’t happen,” he said. “You produce TV.” And if the cameras are not rolling, there is no story.

To prove his point, he cited the case of The Des Moines Register, the Iowa newspaper that was denied press credentials for at least one Trump campaign event after it published an editorial titled “Trump Should Pull the Plug on His Bloviating Side Show.” “What’s more important?” Ramos asked me: the ejection of one reporter or the exclusion of an entire newspaper? Yet for the average television viewer, The Des Moines Register incident might as well never have happened. It occurred off-camera.

Ramos wanted to ask Arpaio about the Department of Justice’s recent finding that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s office singled out Latinos for traffic stops (and thus, indirectly, for deportations), called Latino prisoners “wetbacks” and “Mexican bitches” and failed to adequately respond to allegations of sexual violence against female prisoners. Arpaio, for his part, seemed excited about the opportunity to argue with Ramos, announcing their interview on Twitter a week before it happened. “In fact, I was hoping all the media would come,” Arpaio told me. “But he asked me not to do that.” Arpaio had even tried to get Donald Trump to join the interview. (Trump declined.)

Here, in microcosm, was the new terrain of American immigration politics. Since the 1990s, Univision’s domination of the Spanish-language broadcast market has made Ramos and his co-anchor, Maria Elena Salinas, figures of great interest for presidential campaigns. (In 2014, “Noticiero Unvisión” had more than twice the average daily audience as its closest competitor, Telemundo’s “Noticiero Telemundo.”) Politicians saw Ramos as a kind of emissary from that vague territory known as the Hispanic vote; acceding to an interview was a way of telegraphing that they took the concerns of Latinos seriously and valued their approval. But the advent of Trump, whose tirades about border-crossing rapists seem to have only improved his standing in the polls, has turned this relationship on its head. Now talking back to Ramos about “illegals” can be a politically valuable bit of theater, and it isn’t bad press for Ramos, either. Watching the footage of Trump ejecting Ramos from the Dubuque press conference, my husband observed that the scenario could not have served each party better if they had agreed to a script. Ramos shone like a hero to his followers. Trump shone like a hero to his.

“I want to ask you a favor,” Arpaio said to Ramos. “I know you’re popular. You’re a journalist. I respect you.” They sat inside the open-air prison at a square picnic table shaded by a canvas tent. Around them, the cameramen adjusted angles and microphones in near-90-degree heat. “I want to go to Mexico,” Arpaio said. “Can you get someone to welcome me?”

Photo

“They don’t like me so much,” Ramos replied.

“Really?” Arpaio said, surprised.

Once the tape was rolling, Ramos began with one of his signature polite, ferocious questions: “Last time we were here I told you that you were possibly one of the most despised and hated figures in the Hispanic community. Now clearly something has changed. Donald Trump has taken that place.” Arpaio chuckled. “Eighty-two percent of Latinos have a negative opinion of Donald Trump, according to a CNN poll,” Ramos went on. “Why do you think Latinos hate you and Donald Trump so much?”

“Well, first of all, I don’t like the word ‘hate,’” Arpaio replied slowly. “It has very serious connotations. Maybe disagree with me. I don’t hate you. Some people hate you. They don’t really come out and say it.”

Afterward, both Ramos and Arpaio seemed surprised that, despite their profound disagreements, their conversation had been so civil. As we walked from Tent City to his rental car, Ramos said, “I thought he was going to be more aggressive.”

The following day, Arpaio told me: “I’m a little disappointed he was so nice to me. ... I worry that he’s getting to like me now. He’ll ruin my reputation.”

Jorge Gilberto Ramos Avalos grew up in Mexico City and arrived in the United States in 1983, at age 24, after his career as a journalist for Mexico’s Televisa network came to an abrupt end. Ramos had reported a story about Mexican psychology that doubled as a critique of Mexico’s authoritarian government, which at the time had been controlled exclusively by the center-right Institutional Revolutionary Party for more than half a century. (Its rule would last another 17 years, a streak that once provoked the Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa to call Mexico the “perfect dictatorship.”) Ramos’s footage included interviews he did with the well-known dissident intellectuals Carlos Monsiváis and Elena Poniatowska. When Televisa tried bowdlerizing the footage with a pro-government spin, he destroyed the tape and resigned, effectively blacklisting himself. Less than a year later, he sold his Volkswagen Beetle and moved to Los Angeles in hopes of restarting his career in the United States. In January 1984, he began working for a Los Angeles station, KMEX, affiliated with a Spanish-language network that would, a few years later, be rebranded as Univision.

Ramos’s English was still so wobbly that he felt nervous about asking questions at press conferences, but his timing was impeccable. Two years earlier, Univision made its first national newscast out of its Miami affiliate, WLTV. Just months after Ramos moved to WLTV to host a morning show called “Mundo Latino,” the staff of the national newscast resigned en masse to protest the hiring of a famous Mexican news anchor named Jacobo Zabludovsky who was known for his close ties to the Mexican government. Ultimately, Zabludovsky went back to Mexico for “personal reasons,” leaving the network in urgent need of an evening news anchor. Ramos got the job. He was just 28 years old.

Ramos’s professional ascent also coincided with the rise of Latinos as the most demographically significant minority group in the United States. According to the Pew Research Center, in 1980 there were 14.7 million Latinos in the United States. By 2013, that figure had more than tripled to 53.9 million. In 2010, Latinos passed African-Americans as the country’s single largest minority. When he began working at KMEX, Ramos recalls in his memoir, “No Borders,” the political power of Latinos “was almost nonexistent.” By 2012, however, the Latino vote had become crucial to winning presidential elections, and Univision’s influence rose with the demographic tide. When the network requested that a fourth presidential debate be held and carried exclusively on its network, in Spanish, Republican nominee Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama quickly agreed to a compromise: two town-hall-style “forums” aired in September, a month before their English-language debates.

As the 2016 election approaches, Univision’s parent company, Univision Communications, wants to expand its power beyond the Spanish-language market. It has already announced that Univision will hold a Republican candidates forum with The Washington Post sometime before March. But the main instrument of its ambitions is the company’s fledgling English-language cable network and online-media startup, Fusion. A joint venture between Univision Communications and Disney/ABC that started in October 2013 — with Univision handling content and ABC handling distribution — Fusion hopes to attract a millennial audience. The network’s lead news program is “America With Jorge Ramos.” Ramos is so important to the strategy that for months after Fusion’s start, he appeared every night on both “Noticiero Univisión” (in Spanish) and “America With Jorge Ramos” (in English), as well as on Sunday’s “Al Punto” (in Spanish). He averaged 35 interviews a week in all. Since then, “America With Jorge Ramos” has scaled back to Tuesday nights, but Ramos told me that they are prepared to do more as Election Day nears.

Fusion’s fate may be contingent on the network (and Ramos) being a real actor in 2016. This July, in preparation for its upcoming initial public offering, Univision Communications revealed that Fusion posted a net loss of $35 million in 2014. It has no distribution on Comcast or Time Warner Cable, which means it wasn’t available in the Phoenix hotel in which Ramos spent the night before his interview with Arpaio. Fusion makes and airs documentaries — a strategy it plans to intensify in the coming months — but right now as a news organization, it is essentially an online start-up focused on social media and making headlines.

Dax Tejera, the executive producer of “America With Jorge Ramos,” says that profit is not Fusion’s top priority. “I’ve gone into meetings where my bosses have said, ‘We want Fusion and the brand to be ubiquitous with the election,’” Tejera told me at a food court in the Houston airport, as he and Ramos traveled from Phoenix back to Miami. “They’re not saying to me, ‘We want to hit this target with the ratings, this target with the revenue stream,’ which is the traditional speak in an established media organization. Ours is about awareness and brand identity and association.” The idea, he said, tapping his upper arm, was for Fusion’s fans to want to wear their viewership on their sleeve as “a badge brand.”

Tejera pointed to Ramos’s April interview with the Florida senator and Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio as one of the best examples of how they are trying to drive the political conversation. Before the interview, they convened in Ramos’s office to figure out the most visceral question they could ask about gay rights. They went with: “If someone in your family or your office happens to be gay and they invite you to their wedding, would you go?”

“It got all this attention,” Tejera recalled. “It was the new litmus test of 2016. Nobody had asked it, and everybody started asking it. That’s what we are always trying to do.”

The interview was indicative of an effort to expand Ramos’s franchise beyond his historical role as a tribune of Latinos’ concerns and establish him as a more all-purpose newsmaker. In part, this strategy played upon Ramos’s appeal to a fan base that finds him as attractive as, say, George Clooney. It also suggested an assumption that, after the 2012 election, immigration might not continue to be the political flashpoint that it had been throughout most of Ramos’s career.

Among Republican Party eminences, the conventional wisdom following Romney’s defeat was that the party’s political future turned in no small part on embracing immigration reform. President George W. Bush supported the idea of reform in the 2000 and 2004 elections, as did Senator John McCain in 2008. After McCain’s defeat that November, the Republican strategist Karl Rove argued in a Newsweek column charting a future course for the party that “an anti-Hispanic attitude is suicidal. As the party of Lincoln, Republicans have a moral obligation to make our case to Hispanics, blacks and Asian-Americans who share our values. Whether we see gains in 2010 depends on it.”

Instead, the party’s gains in 2010 came thanks to the Tea Party movement, which took a hard line on immigration. During the 2012 Republican primary, Romney tacked to the right on the issue, opposing the amnesty-offering Dream Act and suggesting that immigrants “self-deport” in a January Republican debate. These statements haunted him in the general election, and after his defeat, the party went through another round of soul-searching. Writing days after the election, the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that avoiding further electoral disaster “requires but a single policy change: Border fence plus amnesty. Yes, amnesty. Use the word.”

But since Trump’s rise in the polls, Republican candidates have abruptly bolted in the opposite direction. The problem, Romney told Salinas after the 2014 mid-term elections, is that “the number of Latinos that vote in the Republican primary is quite small, and so in the long period of the primary, the people trying to get the Republican nomination are going to focus on those who they think will vote in that primary process,” i.e., non-Hispanic white conservatives. So Bobby Jindal tweets that “we need to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.” Jeb Bush defends the term “anchor babies.” Marco Rubio, who once supported immigration reform, tells Fox News that he will not legalize undocumented immigrants during his presidency. And Rand Paul flees from a Dream Act supporter in Iowa, leaving half a hamburger on his plate.

“I had never expected that in 2015 we would get a candidate with such an anti-immigrant position,” Ramos told me in talking about Trump. His own views on immigration have tacked in the opposite direction. In his 2000 book, “The Other Face of America,” he argued for an amnesty similar to the one Ronald Reagan ushered through Congress in 1986, legalizing the status of more than three million people who had been working the United States since before 1982 and could prove that they were not guilty of any crimes. These days, Ramos says that undocumented immigrants must not only be legalized, they must be given a pathway to citizenship. He has even suggested that the United States should consider the possibility of an open, European Union-style border with Mexico.

If such positions have led to accusations that Ramos is an activist, other facts make people wonder about Univision Communications’s bias as well. Fusion’s other major news anchor is Alicia Menendez, the daughter of the New Jersey Democratic senator Robert Menendez. One of Univision Communications’s major stakeholders is the billionaire Haim Saban, a top donor to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Ramos’s daughter, Paola, accepted a position with the Clinton campaign in June.

When she took the job, Ramos disclosed the event in a letter posted on the Fusion website. He told me that he and his daughter still speak to each other almost every day, but that their conversations about politics are now strictly limited. They won’t discuss anything connected to his job or hers. That’s almost everything, I pointed out. “It’s almost everything,” he agreed. What do they talk about instead? “Bah,” he sighed. “Relationships, trips, family. That’s much more important than politics.”

Ramos toyed with the idea of running for a Senate seat as recently as 2002, when he mentioned the possibility in “No Borders.” His most recent political book, “A Country for All” (2010), reads like a cross between a white paper and a stump speech. But when we spoke, he insisted that he no longer has any intention of running for any office. He has decided that he can have more impact as a journalist.

Was this simply politics by another means? I asked. “Well, as a journalist, I want to be relevant, no?” he said. “And I want to be a participant, a player, in the country where I’m living. And that’s what I’m doing every single day.”

Over the years, he said, he has developed a philosophy about what sorts of issues a journalist can appropriately advocate for: human rights and freedom of the press, for instance, and battles against corruption and dictatorships. Partisan politics, he said, falls outside of his territory. But Ramos is unapologetic about exhorting Latinos to exercise the political power they possess as a voting bloc. In “A Country for All,” he argues that candidates can no longer expect to win the Hispanic vote “by simply saying a few words in Spanish, showing up at a press event with a politician who has a Latino surname.” Now, he says, Democrats and Republicans alike must deliver concrete benefits to Latinos. A Supreme Court justice. Immigration reform.

On July 16, a month after Trump announced his candidacy, Ramos made a short speech in Spanish on Univision’s annual entertainment awards show “Premios Juventud.” “We’re going to talk about those who love us, but also about those who don’t love us,” he said. He pointed out, to huge applause, that more than four million Latinos have university degrees and more than one million have master’s or doctorate degrees; that they are not narcos, rapists or otherwise criminals. “When they attack one of us, they are attacking all of us,” he continued. “But we already know what we’re going to do. ... On Election Day, we will remember who was with us and who was against us. No, we won’t forget.” He repeated the warning in English.

Ramos never named Donald Trump. He never told his audience to vote for Clinton or for Rubio. He simply said, “We will remember.” That night, “Premios Juventud” was the top-ranked program on all broadcast television among viewers aged 12 to 34, beating ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.

Whatever happens in 2016, Ramos told me, he believes that candidates who openly oppose Latino immigrants will be soon become relics. Trump? “We might read about him in history books, as the last one who tried to do something like that.”",REAL
"Motherhood, Screened Off","Photo

My mother’s address book is one of the small visual details of my childhood that I can perfectly conjure, although I am sure no photograph of it exists. Fake-leather-bound, filled with her formal, spidery script, it was, to me, barely legible, with addresses crossed out and replaced with new ones as friends’ lives shifted. I often was dispatched to grab it for her from a kitchen drawer. I knew when she was looking for someone’s phone number, which seems unremarkable, except that my own children do not know when I am searching for a phone number, because all they see is me, on my iPhone, intently focused on something mysterious and decidedly not them.

It is that loss of transparency, more than anything, that makes me nostalgic for the pre-iPhone life. When my mother was curious about the weather, I saw her pick up the front page of the newspaper and scan for the information. The same, of course, could be said of how she apprised herself of the news. I always knew to whom she was talking because, before caller ID, all conversations started with what now seems like elaborate explicitness (“Hi, Toby, this is Flora”). And when my mother spent her obligatory 20 minutes a day on the phone with her own aging mother, it played out, always, in the kitchen, where I was usually half-listening as I did my homework, waiting impatiently for her to finish. All was overt: There was much shared experience and little uncertainty. Now, by contrast, among our closest friends and family members, we operate furtively without even trying to, for no reason other than that we are using a nearly omnipresent, highly convenient tool, the specific use of which is almost never apparent.

I thought about this for the first time a few months ago, when I was waiting out my twin sons’ soccer practice, reading “Binocular Vision,” a collection of short stories by Edith Pearlman, on my iPhone. The boys were dribbling their way around cones; I was in the gym bleachers, moved by Pearlman’s meditations on mortality, having a bit of a moment in an unlikely place. None of this was obvious to an observer, which didn’t strike me as important until a woman a few feet away turned to me. “Look at us,” she said, with a sheepish smile, gesturing at a row of parents hunched over their devices. “Our kids are out there practicing, and we’re all on our phones.”

I flushed. I was guilty as charged! But I was almost as quickly indignant: I was wrongly accused! True, I was on my phone, and if my kids looked up they would have seen the same thing the woman did: someone slightly bored, distracting herself with some mindless electronic pursuit. That would describe me accurately in many instances, but it just so happened this was not one of them. At the moment of accusation, I was a lover of great writing who happened to be reveling in some of it on a hand-held screen. With my choice of e-book over hardcover, I had unwittingly cast myself as a familiar, much-maligned character: the mom who is blind to the daily pleasures of parenting, focused instead on some diversion which, by virtue of its taking place on that phone, is inherently trivial. The phone cruelly reduces even the worthiest of escapes to one more bit of busywork.

It is challenging enough to manage to be in touch with people, to remember to pick up the thing and drop off the other thing, to show up on time, to show up at all, to squeeze in time to read, to respond to a friend’s question. Worse, for me, is to try to accomplish all that under a vague cloud of suspicion; to strive to do useful or meaningful things while feeling that I look as if I am likely watching clips of Justin Bieber from the V.M.A.s.",REAL
What Scott Walker Could Have Learned From George W. Bush,"Photo

The Internet is not wanting for explanations of the flameout of Gov. Scott Walker’s short and surprisingly anemic presidential campaign. Walker couldn’t lock down the Republican Party’s conservative base. His average-Joe persona was no match for the scene-stealing Donald Trump. He didn’t understand foreign policy. He didn’t understand domestic policy. He flip-flopped. He was too timid in the first debate. He was too gimmicky in the second debate. Above all, the Wisconsin governor’s downfall illustrates yet again how difficult and unforgiving the business of presidential campaigning is, even for a career politician like Walker.

There’s some truth to all of this. I spent time with Walker in the summer of 2014, reporting for GQ on his gubernatorial re-election campaign. The Wisconsin governor relishes talking about politics the way other men talk about golf, and he had plenty to say on the subject of why Mitt Romney lost to President Obama in 2012. “He didn’t make the case — his message should’ve been based on his track record as governor, on him being a turnaround agent,” Walker told me. “Instead, they took the best things about Mitt Romney and hid them.”

In particular, Walker argued, Romney had failed to make the positive case for his presidency. “They made the huge mistake of thinking that the 1980 Reagan campaign was based on the premise of that great question, ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago?’” he said. “What they failed to realize is that that wasn’t his argument — it was his closing argument. The larger argument was smaller government, lower taxes, more freedom. And that way, people could see not only that life was miserable under Jimmy Carter but that life would be better under Ronald Reagan. Often as Republicans we tend to do this — we get what’s wrong about Barack Obama. And Americans know it, too; you didn’t need to beat it in. You needed to show how you’d be different.”

In retrospect, Walker’s criticism of Romney is revealing: It suggests the extent to which he was concerned with the message of campaigning at the expense of building an operation. It’s true that on the most basic level, Walker, for all his manifestly evident ambition, did little to prepare himself for the scrutiny that comes with a national campaign. He demurred on questions ranging from the Islamic State to evolution. He characterized the idea of building a wall on the Canadian border as “legitimate.” And when asked whether he agreed with Trump’s proposal to repeal birthright citizenship for those born in the United States to immigrants here illegally, Walker said that he did — then, later, that he had no position on the subject and finally that in fact he didn’t agree with Trump on the matter. These weren’t gaffes, per se; they were indicators that the upwardly mobile Walker simply hadn’t slowed down long enough to think through the issues of the day.

But many of the campaigning failures that could be laid at Walker’s feet were also committed by the last governor to inhabit the White House, George W. Bush. In the 2000 election, Bush didn’t know the names of several foreign leaders, referred to the Greeks as “Grecians” and the Kosovars as “Kosovarians” and conducted a listless front-runner campaign that caused him to be poleaxed by John McCain in the New Hampshire primary. But his resilience on the campaign trail, versus Walker’s collapse, shows that the difference between mounting a presidential effort and sustaining one still resides in the candidate’s organization.

Bush’s chief strategist, Karl Rove, had been quietly arranging meetings between the Texas governor and foreign-policy experts fully two years before the general election. By the time Bush announced his exploratory committee in March 1999, the eventual Bush White House chief of staff Josh Bolten had already begun to assemble what would be a vast policy shop of issue advisers who met with the candidate regularly. It’s arguably true that strategists like Rove, James Carville and David Plouffe accrue too much credit for a campaign’s success. But there’s something to be said for enlisting a trusted adviser who will assemble a plan for victory even before the decision to wage a campaign is made.

The chief rap on Walker among his fellow Wisconsin Republicans was that his kitchen cabinet was not exactly a dream team, particularly when it came to national politics. Walker, they argued, lacked a Karl Rove mostly because he believed he was his own Rove. In apparently relying on his own political wisdom for longer than he should have, Walker proved the axiom sometimes attributed to the greatest of all Republicans, Abraham Lincoln: “He who represents himself has a fool for a client.”",REAL
The Understated Elegance of the Airline Scarf,"Photo

In an airport, there is not much to do but wait, and watch. Our fellow passengers tend to dress as if planning to attend a pajama party at 35,000 feet, of course, while the professionals dress professionally. Amid the terminal boredom, we find ourselves comforted by a pilot’s winged badge, oddly transfixed by a gate agent’s epaulets and charmed by what may be the last remaining glamorous thing about flying commercial, which is the scarf worn by the woman pleading for laggards to fold up their tray tables. While not all female flight attendants wear scarves, the attitude exemplified by Air Canada’s uniform guide — ”Wear your scarf at all times!” — is common enough to keep the item tightly knotted to the iconography of the job. In a traveler’s wishful moments, the panache of the scarf can perk up a slog of a trip with the hint of a colorful jaunt.

In the 1930s, when women entered commercial aviation as stewardesses, they were registered nurses, and they dressed the part in smocks and white caps. In time, the uniform evolved away from the medical toward the pseudomilitary and beyond. Kathleen M. Barry, author of “Femininity in Flight: A History of Flight Attendants,” believes that scarves began entering the picture in the late 1960s. It was an age of carriers’ quickly cycling through new designs, of uniform regulations encouraging shorter skirts and greater self-expression and, with a 1970 anti-discrimination decision in Diaz v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., of male flight attendants in their inevitable neckties. “Scarves fit well with the greater variety and more casual, youthful look,” Barry told me.

Photo

In the late 1970s and 1980s, scarves adapted smoothly to an environment changed by feminism and an industry straitened by deregulation. They were, Barry theorizes, “a relatively cheap way to accessorize and bring color to the very sober post-women´s-movement suit-uniforms that became standard.”

Though the scarf coordinates with contemporary gender politics, it also conjures an old romance of the skies, stirring visions of aviators in open cockpits with white silk rippling at their throats and of fighter pilots wearing flight scarves printed with roaring beasts. It is also polymorphously practical. Heather Poole, a flight attendant and writer, has described scarves deployed as ad hoc bikini tops, improvised curtain ties and all-purpose utility tools: “I’ve seen a scarf used as a lanyard, a belt, a sweatband, a ponytail holder, a napkin and a compression bandage.”

The best place for studying the scarf — its many moods of benevolent authority, its articulation of corporate and national brand identities — is uniformfreak.com. The site brings a curatorial clinicism to documenting, by its most recent count, outfits issued by 483 different airlines. (It is the project of a KLM purser in possession of 1,300-odd uniforms and one mannequin with faraway eyes.) The collection includes an early-’70s United Airlines scarf with a jagged Saul Bass jazziness in the lines tracing domestic routes across a map and an Yves Saint Laurent number across which the kangaroos of Qantas hop in lines like delirious checks. You’ll notice a lot of sober Air Force blues that date to the 1980s, and you’ll witness, among the graphic abstractions, more homages to the square than a Josef Albers retrospective.

There is a clear limit to the amount of whimsy you want to see expressed in the clothing of people responsible for your safety at altitude. The scarf is a platform for an overwhelming majority of that whimsy; just look at the shy giraffe of Air Tanzania, which rounds off the official signature of the cabin-crew uniform with a charismatic calligraphic flourish. This is branding rippling in the chance breezes of global corporate culture, enlivening the cabin’s recycled air with a gust of gamesome energy.",REAL

RE: HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES

Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote about Xavier University, the small New Orleans school that sends more black students to medical school than any other college in the country; Dr. Pierre Johnson, an OB-GYN, was a Xavier student who benefited greatly from the school’s structure.

The story of Xavier University’s impact on medical education should hearten educators who believe that determined interventions with individual students can overcome academic disadvantages. Where would Dr. Pierre Johnson be now without the support he received during his difficult first semester as a pre-med student?

Most medical schools leverage their scarce resources to recruit research and clinical stars — and admit only those students whose academic record shows they can succeed without additional support. Dr. Norman Francis, who led Xavier to become the nation’s No. 1 supplier of black medical students, is right to call this dubious statistic a failure of our country. But this failure also rests with the medical schools, which hold the power to offer deserving future doctors like Pierre Johnson the chance to pursue their dream. Joseph A. Flaherty, Dean and Chancellor, Ross University School of Medicine, Miramar, Fla.

Two lines caught my eye in Nikole Hannah-Jones’s ‘‘A Prescription for More Black Doctors.’’ In describing Dr. Pierre Johnson’s interest in medicine, she wrote: ‘‘Something else captured his attention, too, something he had never seen before. His mom’s obstetrician was a black man.’’

This kind of identification is critical; black children need black doctors to emulate. I’m a doctor myself. I’ve worked in many medical schools and led one as dean. I’ve seen the country’s black doctor pipeline — never capacious — shrink even further. And with fewer black doctors as role models, fewer black children aspire to the profession. We have to break this cycle.

We’re beginning a program at my university to show black girls and boys in West Baltimore what a future in medicine could look like. They’ll visit our labs, attend lectures and camps and learn at the knees of world-class physicians. This network will stick with them for years — through middle and high school, college, med school and beyond — building academic readiness alongside career interest. Because that’s another trenchant point in the article: Xavier University’s achievement is pegged to a ‘‘shared responsibility for one another’s success.’’ We do share this responsibility, and so we must share the work.

RE: SEX WARS

Emily Bazelon wrote about the decades-old intellectual war simmering beneath the debate over sexual assault on campus.

‘‘Reframing the Victim’’ struck on what seems to be a strangely flawed feminist logic on preventing sexual violence on campus. Bazelon writes, ‘‘Student activists argue that the burden [to reduce the risk of rape] should be almost entirely on men.’’ Yet taking a public-health perspective, knowing the risks of drunken driving, driving without a seatbelt or smoking cigarettes, who would consciously abdicate her own control in her safety in those behavioral choices? There is no philosophical opposition to these logical approaches to protecting one’s self. As a society, we spread this information and view it as a success when the behavior changes are broadly accepted. Why do we rewrite the rules, effectively disempowering women to protect themselves from the risks of their own behavior? It seems like there is one major behavioral change with the potential for significant impact, if young women view it as a source of empowerment. Men need to be held wholly responsible for their actions, but women deserve the respect of being responsible for theirs. Jennifer Goldsmith, Brookline, Mass.",REAL
Barbie Wants to Get to Know Your Child,"For adults, this new wave of everyday A.I. is nowhere near sophisticated enough to fool us into seeing machines as fully alive. That is, they do not come close to passing the ‘‘Turing test,’’ the threshold proposed in 1950 by the British computer scientist Alan Turing, who pointed out that imitating human intelligence well enough to fool a human interlocutor was as good a definition of ‘‘intelligence’’ as any. But things are different with children, because children are different. Especially with the very young, ‘‘it is very hard for them to distinguish what is real from what is not real,’’ says Doris Bergen, a professor of educational psychology at Miami University in Ohio who studies play. The penchant to anthropomorphize — to believe that inanimate objects are to some degree humanlike and alive — is in no way restricted to the young, but children, who often favor magical thinking over the mundane rules of reality, have an especially rich capacity to believe in the unreal.

Hello Barbie is by far the most advanced to date in a new generation of A.I. toys whose makers share the aspiration of Geppetto: to persuade children that their toys are alive — or, at any rate, are something more than inanimate. At Ariana’s product-testing session, which took place in May at Mattel’s Imagination Center in El Segundo, Calif., near Los Angeles, Barbie asked her whether she would like to do randomly selected jobs, like being a scuba instructor or a hot-air-balloon pilot. Then they played a goofy chef game, in which Ariana told a mixed-up Barbie which ingredients went with which recipes — pepperoni with the pizza, marshmallows with the s’mores. ‘‘It’s really fun to cook with you,’’ Ariana said.

At one point, Barbie’s voice got serious. ‘‘I was wondering if I could get your advice on something,’’ Barbie asked. The doll explained that she and her friend Teresa had argued and weren’t speaking. ‘‘I really miss her, but I don’t know what to say to her now,’’ Barbie said. ‘‘What should I do?’’

‘‘Say ‘I’m sorry,’ ’’ Ariana replied.

‘‘You’re right. I should apologize,’’ Barbie said. ‘‘I’m not mad anymore. I just want to be friends again.’’

This summer, when I visited Mattel’s sprawling campus in El Segundo, a prototype of Hello Barbie stood in the middle of a glass-topped conference table, her blond tresses parted on the right and cascading down to her left shoulder. She looked like your basic Barbie, but Aslan Appleman, a lead product designer, explained that her thighs had been thickened slightly to fit a rechargeable battery in each one; a mini-USB charging port was tucked into the small of her back.

A microphone, concealed inside Barbie’s necklace, could be activated only when a user pushed and held down her belt buckle. Each time, whatever someone said to Barbie would be recorded and transmitted via Wi-Fi to the computer servers of ToyTalk. Speech-recognition software would then convert the audio signal into a text file, which would be analyzed. The correct response would be chosen from thousands of lines scripted by ToyTalk and Mattel writers and pushed to Hello Barbie for playback — all in less than a second.

‘‘Barbie, what is your full name?’’ Appleman asked the doll as I watched.

‘‘Oh, I thought you knew,’’ Barbie replied. ‘‘My full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts.’’

Ever since Barbie introduced herself to the world, she has stood at the uneasy center of questions about the influence of dolls on children. Unveiled at the New York Toy Fair in 1959, she quickly became both a cultural flash point — attacked by the pioneering feminist Betty Friedan and depicted by Andy Warhol — and one of the top-selling toys of all time, with more than a billion dolls purchased. Her stiltlike legs, tiny waist and enormous breasts set her apart from the childish dolls that had reigned until that time; in the 1950s, before Barbie was even released, a mother complained to Mattel that the doll had ‘‘too much of a figure.’’ Her appearance has remained controversial. Protesters at the 1972 Toy Fair complained that Barbie and other dolls encouraged girls ‘‘to see themselves solely as mannequins, sex objects or housekeepers,’’ according to an account in The New York Times.

When children reach preschool, they begin to avidly collect information about gender roles — what distinguishes girls from boys, and what each gender is supposed to say and do, says May Ling Halim, an assistant professor of psychology at California State University, Long Beach, who studies gender identity. Barbie and other dolls are hardly the only influences on this process, but they may be a significant source of gender information. A 2006 study in the journal Developmental Psychology bluntly concluded that ‘‘girls exposed to Barbie reported lower body esteem and greater desire for a thinner body shape.’’

Giving Barbie a voice only increases her potential impact. ‘‘The messages that she says could influence how kids define being a girl,’’ Halim says. An earlier version of the doll with a much more limited ability to speak — Teen Talk Barbie, released in 1992 — enraged critics with the utterance, ‘‘Math class is tough.’’ The American Association of University Women called on Mattel to recall the doll, and the company, apologizing, deleted the offending line from the computer chip.

The technology behind Barbie’s latest campaign to speak was inspired by an incident four years ago, when a 7-year-old girl named Toby sat on the floor of her family’s playroom in Piedmont, Calif. She and her father were chatting with her grandmother, using the Skype app on an iPhone. After the call, Toby gazed across the room at her favorite stuffed animal, a fuzzy rabbit she called Tutu, and then back at the phone. ‘‘Daddy, can I use this to talk to Tutu?’’ she asked.

Toby’s father was Oren Jacob, who until recently had worked at Pixar, and he says he just laughed at his daughter’s remark at the time. Jacob started at the company in 1990, while he was still an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. As a technical director, he helped create Buzz Lightyear’s rocket exhaust in ‘‘Toy Story’’ and the watery world of ‘‘Finding Nemo.’’ By 2008, he was a chief technical officer, reporting directly to John Lasseter and Steve Jobs.

Jacob resigned in 2011, wanting to try something new. Soon after, he and Martin Reddy, who had been Pixar’s lead software engineer, decided to start a company. But the two struggled to find a compelling idea. So Jacob mentioned his daughter’s comment to Reddy, and the more they discussed the notion of talking to toys, the more the idea seemed promising — or even revolutionary, on par with the once-heretical notion of using a computer to create cartoons. ‘‘If you could put an incredible, believable character in conversation, what would it do to the world?’’ Jacob says he and Reddy wondered. ‘‘What kind of characters could you create, stories could you tell and entertainment could you offer?’’

Jacob isn’t young by the standards of Silicon Valley — he’s 44, with close-cropped graying hair. But he is impish, favoring shorts and brightly colored T-shirts, and he is manic, the sentences cascading from his mouth at an auctioneer’s pace. He and Reddy, who is also 44 and has a Ph.D. in computer science, started ToyTalk in May 2011 and, with the help of $30 million so far in investment, have hired nearly 30 employees, including coders, artificial-intelligence experts, natural-language-processing specialists and a creative team. The company’s first commercial offerings were smartphone and tablet apps featuring characters that talk back. But early this year, ToyTalk and Mattel joined forces to create a talking Barbie that could actually listen.

Mattel committed to a November 2015 release date, but as of February, none of Barbie’s lines had been written, reviewed or recorded. Almost none of the technology inside the doll was available off the shelf; Mattel needed specific features and components that fit into Barbie’s notoriously svelte figure. ‘‘For the Wi-Fi transmitter alone, we had five different vendors working on a solution in parallel,’’ Appleman said.

But Mattel executives felt they needed to push forward, not least because the Barbie brand is ailing. The company sold $1.3 billion worth of Barbie products in 2011, but by last year, the figure had dropped to $1 billion. A typical product team at Mattel might have 15 people handling 40 to 75 new offerings; the Hello Barbie team is twice as large, with some members devoted exclusively to the new doll. Usually the product-development timeline is 18 months; Hello Barbie needed to be finished in half that time.

In May, three ToyTalk employees in their 30s — Sarah Wulfeck, Nick Pelczar and Dan Clegg — filed into a conference room in the company’s San Francisco office. Pelczar and Clegg were Shakespearean actors who still performed regularly onstage; Wulfeck studied dramatic writing and did voice-over work in Hollywood. All three supplied the voices for prior ToyTalk characters, but for Hello Barbie, their job was to write the content that would fill Barbie’s vacant brain. (Danielle Frimer, another actor, would join them later.) ‘‘We are trying to build her personality from scratch into the perfect friend,’’ Wulfeck said.",REAL
What the World Got Wrong About Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,"‘‘We are going to have a great time today!’’

Our mutual silent treatment was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of Deborah Morales, a bustling dynamo who has been Abdul-Jabbar’s manager for over a decade. Abdul-Jabbar stood up, walked wordlessly to the hotel’s entrance and peered at the sidewalk.

Morales handles all of Abdul-Jabbar’s public engagements with enormous, slightly delusional enthusiasm, as if he were still winning championships with the Lakers. But her hustle has paid off: Over the past several years, Abdul-Jabbar has emerged as a prolific columnist, writing in Time, Esquire and The Huffington Post, while also maintaining a steady presence as a pundit on political talk shows on MSNBC and CNN. In front of a camera, Abdul-Jabbar comes across as a learned rationalist. He quotes liberally from literature, and he tries to wrestle ideas back into their historical contexts; he rarely, if ever, talks about basketball or his playing career.

After scanning the sidewalk for gawkers, Morales ushered us into a waiting car. The radio was on, tuned to talk news. Morales asked the driver to change the channel to jazz.

The day’s itinerary, enthusiastically set by Morales, called for a trip to the Bronx Zoo followed by lunch at the Empire State Building. Why Abdul-Jabbar, who grew up in New York City and is famously uncomfortable in crowds, would have wanted to visit two of the most touristy, clogged spots in the city was never explained.

By 10 a.m., as Abdul-Jabbar moved briskly among the exhibits, the asphalt walkways of the zoo had started to fill up with schoolchildren walking hand in hand in neon T-shirts. The kids stared at the tallest man they had ever seen, and one of their chaperones turned to a colleague and whispered, ‘‘That’s Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.’’ Abdul-Jabbar strode on, determined to ignore them.

We saw tigers and silverback gorillas, as well as baby goats at the petting zoo. Abdul-Jabbar, looking impassively at the animals, would occasionally recite a fact about their mating habits or natural habitat. ‘‘Sea lions and wolves share a common ancestor,’’ he said dryly. He struck me as a man whose preferred mode of communication is a stack of random, verifiable statements.

In the zoo’s play area, Abdul-Jabbar, at Morales’s urging, lay down on a giant spider web made of ropes for one of dozens of photo ops for his Facebook page. ‘‘Look scared!’’ Morales ordered while pointing her iPad’s camera at Abdul-Jabbar.

‘‘But I’m not scared,’’ Abdul-Jabbar said. After some more coaxing from Morales, he opened his mouth, held his hands up by his face and gave a halfhearted look of faux terror.

As we approached the otter exhibit, a man with his young son in tow looked up at Abdul-Jabbar and said, ‘‘Hey, that’s one of the greatest basketball players of all time!’’ The father extended his hand toward Abdul-Jabbar and said, ‘‘Wow, man. ... Kareem.’’

Abdul-Jabbar dropped into a hunch and stared miserably off into the space above the man’s head. After it became clear that the man and his child were not going to step aside, Abdul-Jabbar offered up a curt nod, turned and stalked off. Morales jogged up to the child and handed him a playing card autographed by Abdul-Jabbar. Gazing after his bowed, retreating figure, the father reached down, grabbed his confused son by the shoulders and slowly walked him toward the next exhibit.

By any measure of accomplishment, whether individual statistics or overall team success, Abdul-Jabbar was an undeniable superstar. His high-school team at Power Memorial, near Lincoln Center, won 71 straight games. At U.C.L.A., Abdul-Jabbar, one of the best players in the history of college basketball, won three national championships and three N.C.A.A. tournament most outstanding player awards. During a 20-year career in the N.B.A., he won the same number of championships as Michael Jordan (six), and bested him by one M.V.P. award (also six). He is the N.B.A.’s all-time leading scorer. And yet discussions of his greatness are usually tinged with annoyance, as if his dominance must be nodded at but not dwelled upon.

He has tried, repeatedly, to register his side of the story by writing. In high school, Abdul-Jabbar took a summer job with a Harlem-based black newspaper and covered the 1964 Harlem riots. His literary ambitions never abated. In the mid-1970s, the writer Gay Talese, while doing research for his book ‘‘Thy Neighbor’s Wife,’’ ran into Abdul-Jabbar at the Playboy Mansion. Abdul-Jabbar told Talese that when he retired, he wanted to become a sportswriter. ‘‘It seemed like such a strange thing to admit,’’ Talese told me. ‘‘It almost felt like he wanted to be anyone else. He was caught in this huge body, but his aspiration was to be diminished in terms of ambition: He wanted to be the man in the press box. You don’t expect a person with stardom in every muscle to want to become a writer.’’

Much later, on a trip back to New York City, Abdul-Jabbar accompanied Talese to Elaine’s, an Upper East Side restaurant that catered to the city’s literary elite. ‘‘He wanted to go be with writers,’’ Talese said. ‘‘He wanted to see Styron and Mailer. Again, I found it very unusual. It just seemed like there was a part of him that didn’t want to be a man of the body.’’

In 1983, Abdul-Jabbar published ‘‘Giant Steps,’’ the first of two engrossing autobiographies. He writes about growing up in the ’50s and ’60s in the Inwood neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, the only child of a Juilliard-trained trombone player turned transit cop and a stylish woman from North Carolina who demanded that her son receive a proper education. As a boy, Abdul-Jabbar — whose birth name was Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr. — ran around with a diverse, middle-class crew. This innocence was shattered when his best friend, a white boy named Johnny, ultimately betrayed him in the seventh grade by calling him a ‘‘jungle bunny’’ and a ‘‘nigger.’’ ‘‘I just laughed at him,’’ Abdul-Jabbar writes. ‘‘ ‘[Expletive] you, you ... milk bottle.’ It was the only white thing I could think of.’’

When he started at Power Memorial, Abdul-Jabbar was already known around the city as an up-and-coming basketball star. He was written up in sports dailies and accosted on the subway. A few weeks after his 16th birthday, Richard Avedon shot his portrait. His coach, with whom he became very close and who shielded him from reporters, was an irascible Irishman named Jack Donohue. The older man would talk to his star about the racism he saw while stationed at Fort Knox in Kentucky. On a trip to North Carolina in 1962, his first time alone in the South, Abdul-Jabbar got to see Jim Crow for himself. ‘‘So I knew a little of what Mr. Donohue was talking about,’’ he writes. ‘‘He was certain that racism wouldn’t die until the racists did, and so was I. What I didn’t tell him was that I hoped it would be soon and that if I could help them along, I would be delighted. I wasn’t quite ready to pick up the gun, but I was intimate with the impulse.’’ (His close relationship with Donohue was damaged when the coach told his protégé that he was behaving like a “nigger” during a halftime rant.)

The next year, the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., was bombed, killing four young black girls and partially blinding another. Abdul-Jabbar’s impulse hardened into something stronger. ‘‘As I watched the ineffectual moral outrage of the black southern preachers,’’ he writes, ‘‘the cold coverage of the white media and the posturings of the John F. Kennedy White House, my whole view of the world fell into place. My faith was exploded like church rubble, my anger was shrapnel. I would gladly have killed whoever killed those girls by myself.’’

After being recruited by nearly all the major college basketball programs in the country, Abdul-Jabbar landed at U.C.L.A., where he studied history and English, dropped acid and became entranced by ‘‘The Autobiography of Malcolm X.’’ After his first season on the court, the N.C.A.A. rules committee outlawed dunking when Abdul-Jabbar netted an average of 29.5 points a game and a 67 percent field-goal percentage. Other players dunked, but none as frequently and as ferociously as he did. The rule change, as a result, was informally known as ‘‘the Alcindor rule.’’ ‘‘Clearly, they did it to undermine my dominance in the game,’’ Abdul-Jabbar writes in ‘‘Giant Steps.’’ ‘‘Equally clearly, if I’d been white they never would have done it. The dunk is one of basketball’s great crowd pleasers, and there was no good reason to give it up except that this and other niggers were running away with the sport.’’ Abdul-Jabbar’s U.C.L.A. team won the national championship again when he was a junior.

That year, Abdul-Jabbar refused to play in the 1968 Olympics because he did not want to represent a country that did not treat him as an equal. The press pilloried him for it. In a much-publicized spot on the ‘‘Today’’ show, Joe Garagiola, a baseball player turned TV personality, asked Abdul-Jabbar why he wouldn’t play for his country.

‘‘Yeah, I live here,’’ Abdul-Jabbar said. ‘‘But it’s not really my country.’’

‘‘Well, then there’s only one solution,’’ Garagiola said. ‘‘Maybe you should move.’’

His relationship with the press only worsened.

In 1969, Abdul-Jabbar was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks, where he would perfect his signature sky hook — a balletic feat that involves an explosive one-legged leap before flinging the ball into the hoop with one hand — and win three of his eventual six M.V.P. awards. Before games, Abdul-Jabbar read books in front of his locker to avoid engaging with reporters. (On his reading list that year: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who reignited his childhood interest in Sherlock Holmes. He admired the detective’s ability to synthesize huge amounts of information.) He became notorious for berating reporters who he thought were trying to bait him into a controversial answer.

Basketball, because it is played in shorts and without a helmet or cap, invites a peculiar intimacy that puts each facial expression, each bodily tic, into heightened focus. Michael Jordan, and then Kobe Bryant, were celebrated for the way they set their jaws in determination. Abdul-Jabbar was judged, and is still judged, on his grim game face and the apparently joyless way he ran up and down the court. He was traded to the Lakers before the 1975-76 season, and won two more M.V.P. awards in his first two years. But the team floundered. When Magic Johnson came to the Lakers in 1979, the press regarded him as the team’s savior. They loved his radiant smile and cast him as the exuberant, warm foil to Abdul-Jabbar’s supposedly arrogant, selfish loner.

Despite being painfully aware of his role in the Magic-Kareem binary, Abdul-Jabbar found himself drawn to the rookie’s enthusiasm. He began to open up, in his own peculiar way. He chose to explain himself to the public by writing a book in which he discussed, in grim detail, the anger he felt toward white people and how it informed the choices he made in his youth. He did not apologize.

This is the Abdul-Jabbar paradox: He’s a man who cares enough about his legacy to write two memoirs and eight other books, but he refuses to engage in the usual smoothing, sanding and editing that is required of a public persona. He instead asks you to accept his version of his truth, even if the truth is that at 68, he sometimes has a hard time being civil to children and still refuses to shake the hand of a reporter.

Abdul-Jabbar rarely stretches out to his full height. Instead, he hunches: His shoulders close on their hinges, and he tucks his chin into his neck. It’s a necessary adjustment to a world that is not designed for a man as tall as he is. In the car on the way to lunch, though, he stretched back in his seat, stared out at the passing skyline and tapped his knee to the jazz on the radio. He said that he once hoped to spend some of his retirement in a brownstone in Harlem, but the crowds and the constant attention had forced a retreat back to a suburb of Los Angeles, where he could get around without the hazards of busy sidewalks. He is divorced and has five grown children: three with his former wife, Habiba, and two by other women. He lives alone. He talked about his recent emergency quadruple-bypass surgery but insisted that the epiphanies of a life-threatening illness had eluded him.

On Fifth Avenue, we were shepherded into a restaurant on the first floor of the Empire State Building. Abdul-Jabbar folded himself into a corner booth — a process that required him to stick his legs out from underneath the table at a 45-degree angle — and ordered a cheeseburger. When the food arrived, Abdul-Jabbar ate like a bird, all pecks and careful dissections. But his mood had brightened. He chuckled at Morales’s giddy stream of non sequiturs, praised her business acumen, even smiled.

He spoke enthusiastically about his admiration for John le Carré and for Edgar Allan Poe’s ‘‘The Murders in the Rue Morgue’’ and about his own writing, which he works on for about three hours each morning before, as he put it, ‘‘my head gets contaminated with other concerns.’’ When he’s writing fiction, he told me, he reads Elmore Leonard and Ross Thomas for dialogue. When he turns his attention to style, he reads writers as diverse as Gillian Flynn, who wrote ‘‘Gone Girl,’’ and the offbeat experimentalist Miranda July.

All of Abdul-Jabbar’s books have been written with a co-author. He worked with the poet Anthony Walton on the history of the black tank battalion. The process of writing a book with Abdul-Jabbar, Walton told me, involved breaking down boxes of Abdul-Jabbar’s research — videotapes, old photographs, contact lists and bibliographies — into a narrative. ‘‘I remember when I realized that the story was going to be the story of one platoon,’’ Walton said. ‘‘That’s one of the oldest stories of all time. It goes back to the Iliad. I remember how excited Kareem was when we talked about that.

‘‘Just imagine what it was like to be him,’’ Walton added. ‘‘It was 50 years of him being 18 inches taller than everyone and having the brain that he had. Imagine being this jazz head coming up during black power. This is just a dude who has a different head.’’

In recent years, Abdul-Jabbar has turned his attention toward the Internet, where he has found an unexpected role among the online commentariat. He has written on Lena Dunham, Ferguson, the body-shaming Serena Williams has endured, the Charleston shootings and Donald Trump. (Trump recently responded to one of Abdul-Jabbar’s columns by printing it out and writing across the text with a marker: ‘‘Kareem: Now I know why the press always treated you so badly. ... You don’t have a clue about life and what has to be done to make America great again! Best wishes.’’) A bit stiff and laden with quotations from Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway, the columns demonstrate a change in Abdul-Jabbar’s politics: He has become a pragmatist who sees the path toward ‘‘racial harmony’’ as a continuum along which one is either moving forward or moving backward. His column on Rachel Dolezal, the N.A.A.C.P. chapter president who deceived people into thinking she was a black woman, struck a conciliatory tone. ‘‘She has been fighting the fight for several years and seemingly doing a first-rate job,’’ Abdul-Jabbar wrote. ‘‘Bottom line: The black community is better off because of her efforts.’’

I found myself wondering what Abdul-­Jabbar’s career might have been like if it had happened 30 years later. Social media has given athletes a direct avenue to their fans that has cut the sports reporter out of his job as translator, and it has emboldened professional athletes to make political statements they might not have made five years ago. During the Ferguson protests last fall, players for the St. Louis Rams walked out onto the field with their hands raised in protest. In December, during the Eric Garner protests in New York, LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and several other N.B.A. players wore ‘‘I Can’t Breathe’’ T-shirts during pregame warm-ups.

These protests were meaningful, but they pale in comparison to the risks Abdul-Jabbar took during his playing career. His refusal to play in the Olympics and his pride in the face of reporters may not be replayed in every Lakers retrospective, but they still linger in the public’s memory. By throwing himself straight into the muck of online opinion-making, where his name can be tweeted, shared and liked, Abdul-Jabbar has dusted off his legacy. The odd man with the discomforting, unrelenting opinions seems finally to have found an audience.

Abdul-Jabbar is a thoughtful and deliberate dresser. Nearly every piece of clothing he owns must be custom-ordered or tailored. In 1967, Life magazine photographed him being measured at a men’s wear shop. The tailor, whose arms are wrapped around Abdul-Jabbar’s waist, is standing on a chair. When I met him again at the Langham, about a month after our trip to the zoo, he was dressed for the night in a simple, impeccably pressed white shirt and a pair of narrow-legged black slacks, stomping around the room in search of his blazer. We were about to head to the Village Vanguard, where he was scheduled to meet a film crew that was finishing up a biographical documentary titled, appropriately enough, ‘‘Kareem: A Minority of One.’’ Abdul-Jabbar, the basketball player, is from Los Angeles, but Lew Alcindor, the kid who hopped around jazz clubs, played pickup games at the famed Rucker Park in Harlem and hung out at parties with Wilt Chamberlain, is a cosmopolitan New Yorker.

I asked Abdul-Jabbar if he sometimes wished he had played in the era of social media, if Twitter and Instagram might have given him a more ideal way to communicate with fans.

‘‘That would have been great,’’ he said. ‘‘It would’ve been nice to really be able to explain myself in the way I wanted to explain myself.’’

He began to talk about Magic Johnson, who, despite the years and their divergent paths, is still cast as Abdul-Jabbar’s opposite. Where Kareem was dour, Magic was outgoing and friendly. Where Abdul-Jabbar was mechanical, Magic was creative. For better or worse, Abdul-Jabbar, basketball’s scarecrow, was uprooted and stored away, forever defined by how much like Magic he wasn’t.

‘‘I understood why people liked him,’’ Abdul-Jabbar told me. ‘‘He had that great smile, so white people thought his life was O.K. They thought that racism had not affected him. They were wrong, of course. But that’s what they saw when they saw him. Magic made white people feel comfortable. With themselves.’’

I asked Abdul-Jabbar if he regretted the way he had treated the press, if he ever wished that he had humored them a bit more in the hope that they might help the public get to know him.

‘‘Oh, yes,’’ he said. ‘‘I just didn’t realize back then how much it was hurting me.’’ He turned away. ‘‘But it cost me dearly.’’",REAL
Life on the Papal Beat,"In 2008, on my way to the Vatican press office for my first meeting, I stopped in St. Peter’s Square. Part of the square is an ellipse designed by Bernini, the master of the Italian Baroque. From most points, the colonnade’s four rows of thick columns are visible, but at a precise spot on either side, they align and fuse into one. In the years to come, I would think often of that spot as key to so much about the Vatican, this ancient institution built of solid stone and optical illusion, where perspective is all. You cannot understand the Vatican without understanding the Baroque — a movement that relied not only on complexity for complexity’s sake but also on trompe l’oeil and perspectival techniques to represent multiple angles of vision simultaneously. And you cannot understand, or govern, Italy without understanding the Vatican, whose most abiding lesson is: Time is power.

How else to make sense of the endless and elaborate delays, the delicate art of manipulating the interlocking gears of the machine, the tug of war between Rome and the local dioceses — all of which produces a perpetual displacement of responsibility that often erodes the line between willful obfuscation and benign incompetence. What providence wills, only bureaucracy can achieve. He who slows down time preserves power. I once asked Giulio Andreotti, the seven-­time Christian Democratic prime minister of Italy, the enigmatic force at the center of so many webs who never so much as flinched during the years of trials for associating with the Mafia — in which he was, naturally, acquitted — why Italy was so bureaucratic. ‘‘It’s a certain guarantee,’’ Andreotti answered, sitting in his Senate office and speaking in his clipped monotone, his shoulders slightly hunched. ‘‘Yes, it’s a weight, maybe something flat and opaque, but it’s also a guarantee to go one step at a time, not to take big curves. If you take big curves fast, that can be very risky.’’

At the Vatican, the Apostolic Palace is the seat of power. Francis keeps his office here, but he has chosen not to live in the papal apartment. Instead, he sleeps in a more humble residence inside the Vatican, the Casa Santa Marta, where he takes his meals in a communal cafeteria. (This, conspiratorial Italians will tell you, is out of fear of being poisoned by his enemies inside the Vatican.) He insists on riding in a Ford Focus, not the usual Mercedes, much to the dismay of some Vatican officials who have grown accustomed to luxury. He disarms Vatican officials by phoning them directly. Time is power, but unpredictability is power, too.

Francis may rewrite the role of pope, may even change the world, but he may not be able to change the Vatican, where for centuries the Roman curia, career Vatican bureaucrats, have bedeviled efforts at reform. To reach the Apostolic Palace, which dates from the 16th century, you enter through St. Anne’s Gate. Past the Vatican bank and beyond a fleet of Vatican City State fire trucks, a Swiss Guard points you to a wood-­paneled elevator. The brass plate marking the floors reads ‘‘I Loggia,’’ ‘‘II Loggia,’’ ‘‘III Loggia.’’ The Secretariat of State, the Holy See’s foreign ministry and Home Office, occupies the third loggia. Here, a seemingly endless hallway with a wall of windows and soaring, coffered ceilings begins with a wall-size map of the globe. It is one of a series of frescoes depicting maps of the known world, painted between 1560 and 1585. There are Greece and Turkey. The Holy Land and Italy are rendered in gold. It was from here, the center of the center, that the Catholic Church brought the periphery under its sway. I have been in this hallway only once — the only time an official ever invited me inside — and it is one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen.

At the Vatican, the aesthetics are generally more rewarding than the access. At best, you might succeed in talking to someone who can tell you he has seen the shadows on the cave wall. In Italy, Vatican coverage relies on the phrase ‘‘si dice che,’’ ‘‘it is said that,’’ or ‘‘voci di corridoio,’’ ‘‘rumors in the hallways,’’ as if news were not so much reported as mysteriously revealed. You have many meetings in anterooms. An usher — the job is a sinecure often passed from father to son — shows you the way. You wait. Sometimes there is a copy of the Jesuit magazine Civiltà Cattolica on the table. Your interlocutor arrives. He — and it is always a he — is cordial. He speaks full and often eloquent sentences in response to your questions but rarely answers them.

At least since the invention of the stained-­glass window, the Vatican has embraced new technologies to help the pope communicate with the faithful. In 1931, Pope Pius XI was the first pope to make a radio broadcast. In 1954, Pope Pius XII was the first to appear on television. In 2012, under Benedict, the Vatican opened the first papal Twitter feeds, which have grown to more than 23 million followers in nine languages under Francis and are managed by the Secretariat of State. But the Vatican press office is designed mainly to get the pope’s words out, not to let the press in. The press office holds frequent news conferences with Vatican officials — never the pope — and issues nearly daily bulletins announcing the pope’s meetings with church and secular officials and nominations or retirements of church officials around the world. Few institutions yield so many stories that can be reported without leaving your desk. The trick is understanding the stakes. A news bulletin arrives via email. Is it a tiny blip or something of vast importance? Benedict announces that he will make it easier for disaffected Anglicans to find a home in the Catholic Church. Is this a small thing or the largest setback in Catholic-­Anglican relations since the Protestant Reformation? The Vatican insists on one interpretation. The Anglicans on another. It is always a question of perspective.

The Vatican may be hierarchical, but it is also decentralized. If you wish to speak to a particular official, you bypass the press office and contact him directly. It helps if someone can vouch for you. A Catholic journalist from a small outlet in a Vatican official’s home country will almost certainly encounter more open doors than a reporter from an international news operation. Being part of the fold is seen as an asset, not a conflict of interest. That is why the best-­sourced Vatican reporters are all practicing Catholics — and mostly men — and why, with a few notable exceptions, all are Italian. That is also why these best-­sourced Italian reporters did not predict that Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires would be chosen as pope. It was outside their field of vision. It was outside almost everyone’s field of vision. The expectation was that a Jesuit who must promise not to seek higher office in the church would not prevail. But once the voting began, ‘‘it was said that’’ the Latin American cardinals rallied around Francis. We may never know for sure. All takes place behind closed doors, when the cardinals are locked — ‘‘con clave,’’ ‘‘with a key’’ — inside the Sistine Chapel. During the conclave, the Vatican press office tried to make the process less opaque. It showed a video of a ghostly hand opening and closing the lids of the urns in which the cardinals place their secret ballots.

Of all aspects of Vatican coverage, the papal trips were my favorite. The Vatican organizes them down to the minute. The atmosphere is somewhere between a presidential campaign and a medieval pilgrimage. There are Masses and pageants; meetings with heads of state; visits to Marian shrines like the one in Fátima, Portugal, where I once saw tiny old women throwing wax models of ailing body parts into special ovens, offering prayers for healing. About 75 journalists — representing print, radio and television — travel on the papal plane. The dress code is suits and ties for men, even in tropical heat, and applies especially to photographers, who get closest to the pope. (Women often get away with a more casual look.) A security detail travels with Francis, but in audiences in St. Peter’s Square he likes to forgo the popemobile, with its bulletproof glass, and wander without warning into the crowd.

John Paul II walked the aisle of the papal plane and chatted with reporters. Francis does that, too, taking questions. On the way back from Brazil, his first foreign trip as pope, Francis was asked about rumors of a ‘‘gay lobby’’ at the Vatican. He said he wasn’t aware of such a lobby and then added, speaking of gays, ‘‘Who am I to judge?’’ Those five words shook the Catholic world. Benedict, by contrast, after a blowup over his remarks that condoms could worsen the AIDS epidemic in Africa, would respond to questions only if they were submitted in advance, and then he read scripted answers.

The lingua franca on the papal plane is always Italian, although sometimes a pope will answer a question in a language spoken in a destination country. There is no simultaneous translation. Under Francis, the press office tries to issue translated transcripts quickly, but it is always one step behind the news cycle. Handouts with the pope’s greetings to the leaders of every country whose airspace the papal plane has traversed are distributed to the press. The pope flies first class; the journalists sit in economy. Until a few years ago, papal trips were run by a Belgian with a fierce temper who would shout at journalists to form a single-­file line, as if we were unruly schoolchildren. The day’s embargoed speeches were distributed as early as 4:45 a.m., with Mass at 5 o’clock for those who wished to attend.

Reporters tend to flock together by language — chiefly Italian, Spanish, English and French. No one ever has the same idea of what the story is. On a papal trip to Britain, centered on the beatification of Cardinal John Henry Newman, the 19th-­century Anglican convert, I was trying to write an article explaining how Newman’s intellectualism resonated with Benedict. Nearby, a colleague from a British tabloid was hashing out his story. ‘‘What would you say was in that omelet that we ate on the plane?’’ he asked me. ‘‘Herbs?’’ En route to France with Benedict in 2008, the journalists for Catholic news outlets were intrigued that his first speeches seemed to support a return to the traditional Tridentine rite that had been pushed aside with the Second Vatican Council. Those of us from secular news organizations were framing the story around the pope’s inveighing, once again, against a world without spiritual values. And then there was the reporter for a German tabloid, peering out the window onto the tarmac, where Carla Bruni was greeting Benedict with Nicolas Sarkozy, then the president of France. He shouted into the phone to his editors: ‘‘She’s wearing flats!’’

Over the years, I met often with the Vatican spokesman, Federico Lombardi, a Jesuit priest who runs the press office and Vatican Radio. He seemed to dislike spinning, a quality that endeared him to me. When delivering bad news, he coughed nervously. He wouldn’t always answer a yes-­or-­no question — he preferred the formulation that something was ‘‘a cammino,’’ ‘‘a path,’’ and I often wondered where, precisely, we might be on the journey and what we might see at the end of it. In 2010, in the middle of the clergy sexual-­abuse crisis, I sent Lombardi a question about how the Vatican had handled the case of an abusive priest in Chile. Lombardi responded that appropriate measures had been taken at the appropriate time. I sent a follow-­up question, the gist of which was ‘‘Who knew what when?’’ His answer came back: ‘‘Respondit eis Pilatus: ‘Quod scripsi, scripsi.’ ’’ ‘‘Pilate said to him: ‘What I have written, I have written.’ ’’ (The Gospel of John: 19:22.)

In July, I stopped by to see Lombardi for the first time in a few years. He greeted me warmly with the informal ‘‘tu,’’ while I, as was our habit, used the formal ‘‘Lei.’’ I sat on a worn leather sofa and he on a swivel chair. He was in good spirits. Francis’ trip to Latin America in June had gone very well. The encyclical on the environment, he said, had already become a best seller in some countries. Excitement was building for the pope’s trip to the United States and Cuba. I asked him if it was challenging to keep up with Francis, who improvises constantly. He rolled his eyes. ‘‘Don’t even tell me about it,’’ he said. There was no nervous cough.

Under Benedict, Lombardi was forever trying to prevent the fallout from a crisis. Under Francis, his repeated message seems to be that the pope, in spite of his focus on those on the margins of society, is not, in fact, a Marxist. He mentioned the pope’s speech in Bolivia, in which Francis spoke of the periphery as a catalyst of creativity and moral engagement. The speech ‘‘could be read as leftist revolutionary, because it largely makes an appeal to the poor,’’ Lombardi said. ‘‘But there was not a single word about class warfare. There’s not a single word about violence. It’s all about common good and love and responsibility.’’

It falls on Lombardi to make clear that both popes speak for the same church. And it falls on the press to describe what we see. Four rows of columns or one? As always, it’s a question of perspective.",REAL
Who Qualifies for ‘Asylum’?,"Photo

It’s an ancient promise: When outsiders flee to a new place in desperate need, they will not be turned away. The Hebrew Bible speaks of six cities of refuge where someone who caused a death unwittingly would be protected from being killed in revenge. The Greeks allowed slaves who ran away from abusive masters and even some criminals to seek sanctuary in certain temples; ‘‘asylum’’ comes from their word for inviolable. According to legend, Romulus, the founder of Rome, extended asylum to people we would call migrants, choosing a spot between two groves on Capitoline Hill for his city’s temple of asylum. ‘‘A crowd of commoners, both free and enslaved, poured in from the neighboring territories, eager for new conditions,’’ the historian Livy wrote. ‘‘This was the first step towards the strength Romulus envisioned for Rome.’’

The right of asylum might seem as culturally embedded as the ruins of one of the old temples. According to international law, if a person merits asylum by showing she has a ‘‘well-­founded fear of being persecuted’’ based on race, nationality, religion, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, she is no longer a migrant, who can be sent away at any time. She must be recognized as a refugee, with a right to be protected for as long as it is unsafe to return home. Yet many of the 380,000 people who have arrived in Europe this year from countries like Syria, Eritrea and Afghanistan have sought legal refuge, risking suffocation in smugglers’ trucks and drowning at sea, only to find themselves described as a threat and a nuisance.

Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain invoked insects when he warned of a ‘‘swarm’’ of ‘‘illegal migrants.’’ Prime Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary is throwing up a fence along his country’s southern border with Serbia and refusing to register asylum claims. ‘‘From a European perspective, the number of potential future immigrants seems limitless,’’ he warned, making the disorder he helped create sound intractable. Most of those arriving, he emphasized, ‘‘are not Christians, but Muslims,’’ adding, ‘‘Europe is not in the grip of a ‘refugee problem’ or a ‘refugee situation,’ but the European Continent is threatened by an ever-­mounting wave of modern-­era migration.’’ In other words, in his view, the people arriving in Hungary are not entitled to protection.

The modern right to asylum has roots in the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution. Fleeing famine and the Bolsheviks, an unprecedented wave of 1.5 million Russians streamed into Europe. They had been stripped of citizenship by the Soviet government, and their plight gave rise to terms that reflected their statelessness. In 1921, the nascent Council of the League of Nations authorized ‘‘certificates of identity’’ for all ‘‘Russian refugees.’’ More than 50 countries agreed to recognize the documents, which gave the Russians the right to work and resettle.

The system began to crack, however, as Nazi aggression destabilized the Continent. In the 1930s, few countries signed the accords that would have provided asylum to Germans, Austrians and Czechs escaping the Nazis. The St. Louis, a ship filled with more than 900 Jews, symbolized the failure of the era: Denied entry by Cuba, the United States and Canada in 1939, it was forced to return to Europe on the eve of the Holocaust. After the war, the international community tried to make amends. A landmark treaty, the 1951 Refugee Convention, expressed ‘‘profound concern’’ for refugees and established the standard for attaining asylum that remains in place today. From this era comes the forlorn, perhaps romantic memory of the post-­World War II refugee, worthy of more sympathy than a migrant (an ostensibly neutral word now tainted by its proximity to ‘‘illegal immigrant’’).

But even in that moment of accord, there was still a question of who would bear responsibility for the flood of bodies with their urgent needs. ‘‘The grant of asylum may place unduly heavy burdens on certain countries,’’ the treaty’s preamble stated, such that global protection cannot be achieved ‘‘without international cooperation.’’ Today, while Europe squabbles over quotas, 86 percent of the world’s 19 million refugees live in developing countries like Ethiopia, Kenya and Pakistan. Turkey has more than two million Syrian asylum-­seekers — compared with zero for the wealthy countries of the Persian Gulf. There has been far more global fractiousness than collaboration, though Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, preparing her country to accept 800,000 people this year, reminded the world that the international right to asylum ‘‘has no limits on the number of asylum-­seekers.’’",REAL
Netromancy,"Photo

When Bri Luna started her website, the Hoodwitch, she intended to carry on the legacy of her grandmother, who was a curandera: a traditional spiritual healer from Mexico. Luna, a beautician in her 20s who lives in Seattle, uses the site to publish tutorials on topics like how to cleanse a new home by burning sage and how the lunar cycles affect your daily life. What started out as a hobby became so popular that Luna turned it into a business, opening an online shop where she sells crystal clusters, bundles of dried herbs and vintage tarot guides.

Lately, the Internet has become a more enchanted place. Scroll through popular Instagrams, Tumblr accounts and Pinterest boards, and you’ll unearth posts of glittering geodes, aura photography, psychedelic patterns and geodesic designs. Even Silicon Valley itself isn’t immune: A recent article in SF Weekly reported that some local start-ups have turned to mediums and psychics for financial advice and forecasting — and, in one case, to exorcise malfunctioning hardware.

What could explain this technologized return to medieval fascinations? K-Hole, the marketing and branding agency responsible for coining the word ‘‘normcore,’’ thinks it has an answer. A recent report from the firm touches on ‘‘occult technologies’’ and compares such modern magic practices to a ‘‘cult of positive thinking.’’ Irrational optimism, they argue, is especially resonant with a generation of young people whose future is uncertain, their adult lives defined by economic and social upheaval. ‘‘There isn’t a procedural way to live your life, and that might be inspiring people to think mystically for guidance,’’ Sean Monahan, a founder of the agency, said. ‘‘If you can’t get the job you want by getting a certain degree from college, maybe you can cast a spell.’’ Technomysticism is also a fittingly nebulous ideology for a time in which the line between wizardry and technology has blurred. Smartphones lack visible moving parts but still summon hot meals, automobiles and freshly pressed laundry at the push of a button. Social media can be used to cast illusion spells, allowing people to fool the world, portraying themselves however they like.

But Luna offered a much simpler explanation for the craze: ‘‘People are tired of technology and just want to get back to nature.’’",REAL
Dead Forests and Living Memories,"Later that night, I compulsively searched for images of elms on the Internet, seeking their buoyant, ragged silhouettes in snapshots of village fields or half-hidden behind actors in 1960s films. I saw trees like frozen cumulonimbus clouds towering over cricket matches at English public schools; postcards and photographs of elm avenues in Massachusetts and coastal Maine, lofty branches shading summer streets and suburban Oldsmobiles. These trees were the ghosts of half-remembered landscapes, and looking at them I realized that living trees could haunt you, too. That drive in Suffolk had changed the meaning of ash trees for me. From now on, each one I saw would mean death, no matter how healthy it might be.

Photo

Should they contract a mortal disease, however, trees cope far better than we do. Many can regenerate. The vast Appalachian chestnut forests crowned with white flowers have all but disappeared, but fallen trees still sprout new shoots from their roots. As soon as they reach a certain height they again become susceptible to blight and die. Chestnuts and elms living in this endlessly youthful state are less fruitful than mature trees, and they trouble us because they are not what we think they should be. We use trees to measure our own lives, to anchor our notions of time. To most of us, trees represent constancy and continuity, living giants that persist through many human generations. We want them to achieve maturity; we want them to tower above us.

The spectral elms on the Internet were images of a different kind of extinction from that of the passenger pigeon or dodo: the extinction of a landscape. For days afterward, I found myself looking out at the blank brows of local hills, imagining there the billowing shapes of elms. I was preparing myself to think about what it would look like here when all the ashes were gone. It was deeply painful to force myself into a kind of anticipatory ‘‘solastalgia,’’ a term coined by the Australian environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht to refer to people’s emotional distress when their home landscapes become unrecognizable through environmental change. He was speaking of the effects of drought and strip mining in New South Wales, but solastalgia can arise in landscapes as varied as melting tundra and southwestern states stricken by wildfire or drought. Like droughts, tree diseases bring economic loss and ecological impoverishment while stripping familiar meaning from the places we live. Writing on the slow death of American forests from a hundred years of tree diseases in the book ‘‘Nature Out of Place,’’ the writer Jason Van Driesche found himself almost mute: ‘‘This is my home. How can you put something like this into words?’’

But there are trees that can offer solace. I also looked for photographs of them on the Internet: the last few big American chestnuts, some of which have been given names. The Adair County Chestnut, found in 1999 in Kentucky, for instance. Rounded in form, it does not much resemble the gigantic, spiraling cathedral-columns of ancient Appalachian trees, but it is beautiful, spreading dark limbs and long, serrated leaves toward the sun. Around 500 are left: the Hebron Chestnut in Maine; an unnamed chestnut in Ohio. People seek out these singular chestnut trees that have cheated death; some even steal leaves and pieces of bark from them as remembrances. The precise location of these trees must often be kept secret — encountering one, it is said, is an experience akin to finding Bigfoot.

Dedicated scientists, volunteers and nursery workers have spent many decades trying to restore the American chestnut with the aim of recreating the landscapes we have lost. Some organizations, such as the American Chestnut Foundation, backcross American trees with resistant Chinese varieties to produce seedlings that resemble American chestnuts but have sufficient Chinese qualities to survive the effects of blight. Others, like a team at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, insert genes from wheat and other plants into chestnut embryos to change their chemistry and make them more resilient to attack. Despite the increasing success of such projects, some commentators regard them as a diversion: They believe it would be better to put resources into preventing new diseases than attempting to cure old ones. Their position makes sense if you think our reasons for wanting to restore the trees are merely ecological. Of course they are not. They shape the landscapes of our lives and are bound up with our sense of identity.

Increasingly, knowing your surroundings, recognizing the species of animals and plants around you, means opening yourself to constant grief. Virulent tree diseases hit the headlines, but smaller, less visible disappearances happen all the time. The flycatchers that nested in my neighborhood 10 years ago have vanished; meadows in my hometown that were full of all kinds of life have become housing developments full of nothing but our own. People of a certain age tend to look back elegiacally at the things that have gone: the store you used as a kid that closed, the room that became a memory. But those small, personal disappearances, however poignant, are not the same as losing biodiversity. Brands are not butterflies. Changes to city skylines are not the same as acres of beetle-blasted trees: Though they are caught up in stories about ourselves, trees are not ever just about us. They support complex and interdependent communities of life, and as forests slowly become less diverse, the world loses more than simply trees. It has been suggested that the rise of Lyme disease in many parts of North America and Europe is in part because less-diverse forests favor the ticks that carry it.

I am old enough to remember elms and the landscapes they made; people only a few years younger than me do not, and to them the elm-free fields are reassuringly normal. Are we now becoming inured to a new narrative of nature, in which ecosystem-level change in accelerated time scales is part of the background of everyday life? Children who are growing up watching glaciers retreat and sea ice vanishing, villages sinking, tundra wildfires raging and once-common trees disappearing — will they learn to regard constant disappearance as the ordinary way of the world? I hope it is not so. But perhaps when all the ash trees are gone and the landscape has become flatter and simpler and smaller, someone not yet born will tap on a screen, call up images and wonder at the lost glory of these exquisite, feathered trees.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: The Thorne Miniature Rooms,"Photo

Down a center flight of marble stairs in the front entrance hall of the Art Institute of Chicago, there is a real-life time machine. It bears no resemblance, however, to any such devices from fiction. There are no displacement spheres, quantum-leap accelerators or flux capacitors; it looks nothing like H.G. Wells’s gilded time-sleigh with its gleaming dinner platter, crystal-knobbed control lever and plush velvet driver’s seat. Indeed, this particular time machine doesn’t even have space for passengers, a fact that becomes immediately apparent upon approaching it. There is only a roomful of wide-eyed drifters trying to project themselves, via intensely prolonged gazes, through a series of glass-paned portals, tilting their torsos and craning their necks as if trying to inhabit the miniature worlds beyond.

The institute’s Thorne Miniature Rooms collection comprises 68 deftly dwarfed and obsessively detailed re-creations, on a scale of one inch for every foot, of English, French and American household interiors ranging from the 13th to the 19th century. Each one is, in essence, a fully fixed and furnished moment from a bygone day. Adults peering in on these little dioramas become children again, and their children the suddenly more mature and seasoned guides to the Tom Thumb fantasies the rooms contain — the minuscule violin resting in an open case on the cushioned window seat of a circa-1800 English drawing room, for instance, or the swath of afternoon sunlight cast across a pair of glasses and a porcelain tea set on a late-18th-century Cape Cod living-room table.

The earliest dollhouses were, in fact, born of a most adult yearning: immortality. What is believed to have been the very first ‘‘baby house,’’ as the dollhouse was formerly known, was built in 1558 on behalf of Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria. It was a diminutive 3-D enshrinement of all the owner’s worldly belongings, of his literal and figurative station in life. Soon a fad among the nobility and rich, such distillate minidwellings were intended not for play but for study, as working models of how to properly design and manage a home. This is the tradition that was ingeniously revived in the 20th century by Mrs. Narcissa Niblack Thorne.

Born in 1882 in Vincennes, Ind., she married James Ward Thorne, the heir to the Montgomery Ward department-store fortune, while they were young, leaving her free to pursue her artwork. One story has it that her original inspiration was a miniature shadow box that she came upon in an Istanbul bazaar in the 1920s. It suggested to her a way to meld a childhood fascination — the many antique dollhouse miniatures that an uncle, Vice Adm. Albert P. Niblack, sent her in the course of his world travels — with her later love of all the grand and stately interiors from centuries past that she encountered during her own frequent travels to Europe and the major cities of the Northeast.

From a description of the ‘‘baby house’’ of Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria, in ‘‘Dolls’ House Furniture,’’ by Halina Pasierbska: One chamber ‘‘was bedecked in red velvet and taffeta with gold silk walls. This room contained a miniature ivory chamber pot and a mirror with an ivory frame. A weaving frame and sewing box also graced this room, practical and at the same time ostentatious.’’

The Thornes’ apartment on Chicago’s North Lake Shore Drive was said to be overrun with miniatures. Mrs. Thorne compulsively collected over the years old royal dollhouse relics, a number of them purchased from her favorite Parisian antiques shop, a place she refused all her life to identify. By designing her own rooms, she now had a way to permanently house those remnants and bestow them to posterity. Beginning in 1930, she scoured whatever reference material she could find on period architecture, interior design and decorative arts to flesh out the sketches and blueprints for the different quarters in which such pieces would have once resided. She then seized upon the ready availability during the Depression of some of the country’s finest architects and interior designers. By 1940, Thorne and her team of skilled craftsmen made over 100 pint-size ‘‘period rooms.’’ They constitute a beguilingly timeless bit of child’s play: a series of lushly lived-in pasts, chambers haunted by distant presences you feel certain have just left the premises — or are poised to enter at any moment from a flower-strewed side garden, a rear entrance foyer or the top of a lovely front-hallway staircase.

I stopped off at the Art Institute while making a cross-country drive this summer. It had been over 30 years since I last saw the Thorne rooms, and yet the scene upon entering the exhibit was instantly familiar. Paintings and sculpture induce silence, furtive whispers at most; the Thorne rooms, a ruckus. Everybody wants in. Not just on sharing the universal thrill of seeing daily life represented on a Lilliputian scale — they want in on that life itself. This is the particular genius behind Thorne’s rooms. It is not just their verisimilitude, but also the way they draw us in with enticing glimpses of spaces just beyond the ones recreated — an upward-winding staircase, a hanging coat in an adjacent chamber, a shiny silver cocktail tray on an outer balcony table, a mock city skyline twinkling in the distance. Somehow, these various doors, ajar on endlessness, inspire in us an altogether lofty and untenable urge to abide forever within a lavishly furnished shadow box.

‘‘Listen to you,’’ I overheard one woman saying to her husband, as he carried on about all the things he would plant in the tiny garden outside the latticework window of an early 18th-century English cottage kitchen. ‘‘Since when did you get such delusions of grandeur?’’",REAL
How Going Green Can Give You License to Buy Cupcakes,"Photo

This article appeared in the September 20, 2015 issue of The New York Times Magazine.

Five years ago, a provocative experiment found that people who bought ‘‘green’’ products at the grocery store were afterward more likely to lie, cheat and hoard prize money, when compared with a control group that didn’t buy such products. Apparently, the authors concluded, ‘‘virtuous acts can license subsequent asocial and unethical behaviors.’’ The study has been widely cited — even in the face of criticism from some scientists over its methods and conclusion — but it didn’t address whether bringing green, reusable bags to the store might influence shoppers’ choices once they got there.

For a study published last month in the Journal of Marketing, Uma Karmarkar, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, and Bryan Bollinger, an assistant professor at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business, did just that. When a large grocery store in California gave them access to data from its frequent buyers’ program from mid-2005 through mid-2007, a period when the store offered a 3-cent credit for every bag brought in by a shopper to carry items home, they were able to link green bags to actual purchases.

People generally bought more organic produce when they brought their own bags. Presumably they were, in the language of the study, psychologically ‘‘primed’’ by eco-friendly totes to focus on eco-friendly groceries. Yet they also tended to buy extra potato chips, cookies and other treats. Their righteousness ‘‘licensed’’ their self-indulgence, according to the researchers. Additional purchases of organic foods were unrelated to splurges on junk food; indulgent foods only had a clear correlation with bags from home.

Of course, this didn’t show that reusable bags caused changes in shopping behavior. So adult volunteers were asked online to fill a make-believe grocery cart as they would on a routine shopping trip. A portion of the participants were told to imagine bringing their own reusable bags. This group tended to select more sweets than their counterparts who were not told to bring bags — except in the case of those whose real families included children, in which case they skipped the cookies. (Perhaps the impulse to reward oneself for the bags yielded to the desire to feed children well.) Researchers next told some new participants that they were freely choosing to bring their own bags; others were told to pretend that grocery-store policy required them to supply their own bags. Only those who imagined bringing bags voluntarily bought more candy. ‘‘It does seem that you have to decide to bring the bags yourself — not be compelled to bring them — in order to trigger the licensing effect,’’ Karmarkar, the study’s co-author, says. But the takeaway of the study should not be that reusable bags are a liability to those trying to eat well, she adds.

‘‘The lesson,’’ Karmarkar says, ‘‘is that fairly insignificant-seeming choices can have multiple, unexpected consequences on our later behavior, often unconsciously.’’ Feeling virtuous about one decision might be prodding us toward other choices that we would regret in different circumstances.

A Stout for All Seasons,"Photo

Even in my long-­ago earliest drinking days, I had a hunch that porter was the drink for me. It seemed like the liquid equivalent of how I liked to see myself: earthy and reliable, but also undeniably dark.

After an unhappy encounter with Guinness as a teenager — it was served to me warm, a frequent error — I almost gave up on it. An inner voice told me to persevere. When I finally drank it at the right temperature — cold, but not intensely cold, about 44 degrees — my faith in stout was rewarded. A summer spent in Dublin, where drinking stout, especially Guinness, is a ritual of everyday life, cemented our relationship. More than 20 years later, whenever I pull a pint of Guinness for one of my regulars, I ask myself if Tommy Smith, publican at Grogans, my favorite Dublin pub, would approve of my pour.

I still drink stout in the summer and find it as refreshing as any of its lighter, paler kin on hot days — so long as it is not served warm. But I know many who regard porter as a cooler-­weather drink, and I get it. It’s cozy. A pint of porter is a fine match for a cool autumn day, for a tattered, beloved sweater, for your most broken-­in boots. Many smaller breweries acknowledge this seasonal affinity and release their deepest, darkest offerings only in fall and winter.

So what’s the difference between porter and stout? That depends on whom you ask, and obfuscation abounds. The word ‘‘stout’’ — suggesting fuller flavor and sometimes a higher alcohol content — was applied as a descriptor long ago to many kinds of beers, but it stuck hardest to porter. Stout is, then, a subcategory of porter, but as it has evolved, it has led to many further categories: imperial stout (especially strong), milk stout (to which lactose is added, making for a sweeter, creamier concoction), stout brewed with oats (the best are particularly smooth and rich) and even stout formulated with oysters (briny). Each has its virtues.

A well-­poured Guinness is an eternal joy: It is beautifully balanced, full-­flavored, the exemplar of stoutness. But there are many other porters that deserve a place in our 20-­ounce glasses. I’m crazy for the Breakfast Stout — rich with oats and coffee and chocolate — made by the Michigan brewery Founders. Among the extra-­strong pours, Thirsty Dog’s Siberian Night Imperial Stout has exceptional depth and lingers a very long time.

And porter is great fun for mixing. There’s something inherently subversive about the classic Black Velvet cocktail, which marries porter — said to be named for the London laborers who drank it enthusiastically in the 18th century — with Champagne: a destruction of social order in a flute glass. But if I’m not drinking stout on its own, I like it best (particularly a deeply chocolaty version) as the foundation for a float that has the power to win over both those who claim they don’t like sweets and those who claim they don’t like stout.

Mushrooms Upon Mushrooms,"Photo

Say ‘‘mushroom mille-feuille’’ to most veteran cooks and eaters, and they will most likely picture a golden mound of puff pastry filled with wild mushrooms in cream and herbs — a fine dish, if old-fashioned and increasingly rare.

This is nothing like that.

Early this summer, I was steered by the elbow to Dirty French, the newest New York restaurant from Rich Torrisi and his partners. Their first, Torrisi Italian Specialties, a reimagining of Italian-American classics, opened in 2009 on Mulberry Street. Dirty French, which opened in the fall of 2014 on Ludlow Street, handles sort-of-classic French food in a similarly playful manner.

And that’s where I was commanded by my dinner companion to order the mushroom mille-feuille: ‘‘It’s the best thing on the menu,’’ he insisted. I wasn’t sure what would be placed before us, but I certainly wasn’t expecting this: layers of paper-thin mushroom slices, seasoned, buttered, pressed in a pan and chilled for a day, then sliced and seared and served with a piquant sauce.

Think of the best pommes Anna, but with the firm, chewy texture of good mushrooms, perfectly crisped and graced with a colorful purée. It’s not literally a mille-feuille, which translates as ‘‘a thousand leaves,’’ but more like 50 or 75 layers. The sauce, which on my first visit was a green curry made with ramps, is neither irrelevant nor lily-gilding, though the mille-feuille itself is so enticing that just a little soy sauce and lemon would complement the mushrooms’ earthiness well.

Simple as it sounds, this dish was the most interesting thing I’d eaten in months. The next morning, I was on the phone with Torrisi, asking him if the mille-feuille was too complicated for us — that is, for you and me, ordinary home cooks. ‘‘With a little patience, anyone can do it,’’ he said. Soon I was in the Dirty French kitchen, where Torrisi, along with Dai Matsuda, the chef de cuisine, greeted me with a huge pile of sliced king trumpet mushrooms and a pot of melted butter. In their hot and busy kitchen, we went to work, buttering, salting, layering and repeating.",REAL
Should I Help a Classmate Who Sexually Harassed My Friend Get a Job?,"Photo

At work, we fill a lot of vacant positions through word of mouth. I recently posted a job on my college’s career network and received a résumé from someone in my graduating class. I’ve never met this person, and I know him to have been a diligent student who won a prestigious fellowship during senior year. He would probably be a leading candidate, and by passing his résumé on, I would be implicitly giving my stamp of approval. The problem is that freshman year he sexually harassed and attempted to sexually assault a good friend of mine. A third party intervened before it escalated and brought her to me and another friend. She decided not to take the incident to any authority, and she eventually worked through the experience. The thought of working with the man who brought so much pain to a good friend is hard to swallow, but I do not know what the ethical thing to do is. It is not my story to share, and I do not want to bring the question to my friend for fear of opening old wounds. Am I allowed to share this information with the head of human resources? Can I take an act committed five years ago by somebody I never met and use it to determine his future job status? Is there a way to bring up my discomfort without outing him? NAME WITHHELD

Amy Bloom: If I was absolutely sure that this happened and didn’t feel any need to hear the other person’s story, I might not pass on the résumé. But I would have a twinge about it. There are some very fine and competent and hardworking people who did some awful things when they were 18. I might even qualify as one of them.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: Let me sign up for that, too.

Bloom: You can’t speak up for the victim ­— it’s not your story to tell. I’m not sure it makes a lot of sense to go back and say to her, ‘‘Hey, five years ago, you didn’t want to bring this up to the authorities, but now I feel that maybe I should bring it up to a potential employer so that they don’t hire your former harasser.’’ That just doesn’t strike me as particularly helpful or even ethical. If you wanted to be more engaged with the victim at the time, that would have been five years ago and with her permission. It also doesn’t seem right that you should say, ‘‘He’s a hard worker, but I know something about him that you would want to know.’’

Kenji Yoshino: I totally agree with you. The competing ethical obligations — to your friend, to the harasser, to the employer — cut in different directions. Fortunately, there’s a simple answer here: You have the discretion not to pass along the résumé. That strikes a balance of remaining discreet for both the victim’s sake and the accused’s sake (let’s remember that he was a minor or a young adult at the time), while not exposing your employer to the risk of hiring such an individual.

Appiah: As you said, in passing on the résumé from someone in your alumni circle, you’re definitely giving the impression that you think the person is O.K. Because you can’t explain why you don’t think the person is O.K., you have no choice but to give a misleading impression either way.",REAL
A Suspicious Object,"‘‘I can’t find my backpack,’’ he said.

Together we searched the apartment — under beds, behind doors, we even checked the bathroom. It wasn’t anywhere. ‘‘Maybe you forgot it at school.’’

Tom shrugged. ‘‘Maybe.’’

Outside, I felt as if I were deep in a dream. Everything was exactly as it always was, but nothing was quite right. We felt light and free, with nothing to carry except a small lunchbox. The normally busy street was empty. And then, when we were a block away from the school, we heard sirens. As we approached the intersection with the main road, we saw police blockades, a traffic jam — and down the street, a white police bomb-squad van. An officer raised her arm and told us not to come any closer. She didn’t need to worry that we would.

Clusters of parents and children stood on the corners of the intersection. Seeking the comfort of conversation, something to draw me out of my haze and remind me that this was real, I asked the woman next to me, ‘‘What’s happening?’’ She was wearing a colorful sundress and sandals despite the hint of a chill in the air, and she answered with a knowing look and a half-smirk: ‘‘Hefetz hashood.’’

Tying her hair into a knot at the back of her head, she gestured with her chin toward the school.

I leaned down to explain to Tom what was going on. Part of me wanted to just say there was a little car accident, a fender-bender, and everything was fine. But he was too smart to be fooled, and I knew he’d hear the truth from other kids in his class. Just as I finished saying, ‘‘but I’m sure it’s nothing,’’ we heard a boom. It wasn’t the boom of a big explosion, but more like a balloon popping. I knew the bomb-disposal unit had sent in a robot to shoot the suspicious object. I’d seen this happen many times.

The police officers finally moved the blockades, and along with dozens of others, Tom and I walked toward the school. At the entrance gate I looked around for signs of what had happened and saw a few remaining police officers, along with the school security guard, whom I knew, standing near the soccer goal some 20 feet away.

Nothing dawned on me, believe it or not, even as we found ourselves turning toward the ‘‘scene.’’ But after a few steps Tom stopped. I looked down and saw tears in his little blue eyes. He pointed, and my gaze followed his finger to the residue of the explosion — a heap of torn fabric — surrounded by scattered papers. Though dusty and partly shredded, it was easy to make out the green color.",REAL
Kate McKinnon Hates Letting Her Hair Down,"But it’s a cliché that’s pathetic. What’s not to love about a crazy cat lady? You have to be very giving to be a crazy cat lady.

I hear that you used to write young-adult books. What were they about? And did they ever get published? Where did you hear that? I ghostwrote them.

See, you do believe in ghosts. Did you learn anything from that experience? That I love silence. A day of silence. That was one of the happiest times.

What makes you laugh? Farting. Nothing makes me laugh more than farting. It’s such an insult that foul gas comes out of a hole in our butt with a sound to announce itself. It’s the ultimate bad thing about being a person.

You do a number of impressions of men: Justin Bieber, Robert Durst, Keith Urban and others. Do you find playing men more taxing or more liberating? More liberating. I hate the feeling of having hair on my neck. I don’t know how you have your hair down right now.

Your colleagues on the show say that with any impression, you are always the most stressed about making sure that it is not mean for no reason. Why? It’s a source of tremendous stress. You don’t want it to be toothless, because then it’s not funny. But I always try to make it empathetic. Particularly with Justin Bieber. I’m very worried about him being upset.

Why are you worried about that? I love him. I love them all. They’re like my children.

You’re an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter, but your impression of her sort of dovetails with the haters’ assessment of Hillary: that she is pathologically ambitious and insincere. Do you fret about that? Um, yes. But it’s my job to make comedy out of current events. A good impression is sort of a juxtaposition of disparate elements. For instance, Angela Merkel, to me, is a very emotional German; she may not be in real life, but that’s how the writers and I conceived of the character. With Hillary, it’s that she’s a staunch, passionate lady, and in our culture, unfortunately, there’s something funny about that.

In order to nail an impression, do you have to share some of that person’s DNA? What part of Hillary Clinton is part of you? Yeah, what I find so lovable about her is her conviction. And I feel like I have that. I just love how badly she wants to fix stuff. I would like to do that. I’m just not smart enough.

Would a male politician be similarly mocked for his ambition? No, I don’t think so. If you had a man saying the same things, that would not qualify as a comedic character. I think that says more about our culture than it does about her.

When Tina Fey did Sarah Palin, she worried about having an effect on the election, pro or con. What do you worry about when you do Hillary? I unequivocally want her to win, and I don’t really think I have the power to sway anything.

RE: G.O.P.

Robert Draper wrote about several foreign-policy advisers to Republican candidates and the lessons of Iraq.

Barack Obama won the White House on the basis of his principled opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and any Republican who hopes to succeed him will have to affirm that toppling Saddam Hussein was a colossal blunder. When former Senator Jim Talent says, ‘‘We can’t spend the next term with everybody pointing fingers about what went wrong with Iraq,’’ he reflects the Republicans’ overall failure to raise the discourse to the strategic level. The decision to blow up Iraq a dozen years ago — on the basis of flimsy intelligence and the harebrained idea that the currents of culture and history could be rerouted by armed force — created a hothouse environment for terrorism, unleashed a transnational sectarian civil war and removed the most important counterweight to Iran. The effects of this mistake will resonate for decades to come. If the Republicans are to win back their brand as the ‘‘pros from Dover’’ on national security, regaining our confidence must begin with their sober recognition of George W. Bush’s folly. John Arquilla, Monterey, Calif.

The 2003 invasion of Iraq was not simply ‘‘reckless,’’ as Robert Draper asserts more than once: It was deliberately mendacious, impelled by intentionally skewed intelligence, for which no single administration official was held accountable.

When will advisers, candidates, journalists and historians get the history right? Until they do, our country has no hope whatsoever in having a cogent discussion about how to deal with ISIS, let alone organizing an adequate defense. The invasion equation the candidates and their advisers need is to add, subtract, multiply and divide accurately, not spin fantasy math yet again. Victoria C. Bond, New York

No Republican presidential candidate expounds a foreign policy that honors the philosophy and sacrifices of the American Revolution: aggressive self-defense. As Secretary of State John Quincy Adams elaborated in an 1821 address to Congress: Our glory is liberty, not world domination or force; we celebrate the march of the mind, not the march of the soldier. According to Adams, the United States wishes freedom and independence to flourish everywhere, but we fight only to defend our own to avoid the self-ruination of chronic conflict. As Alexis de Tocqueville observed in ‘‘Democracy in America,’’ ‘‘All those who seek to destroy the liberties of a democratic nation ought to know that war is the surest and shortest means to accomplish it.’’ Bruce Fein, Washington

RE: THE ETHICISTS

The ethicists explored whether a young gay man should remain closeted in order to continue getting money for his college education from his father.

The fundamental question here is whether there are circumstances when it is ethical to deceive a donor or lender because the terms are objectionable. I think the answer is ‘‘no.’’ A recipient must, in order to maintain her integrity and dignity, be honest in accepting the money. I agree that the donor here is acting unethically, but his behavior is unlikely to make his son feel better in compromising his own ethics. The father will have to live with himself and his actions, just as the son must live with his deception. Susan Quill, Chevy Chase, Md.

Straight-out lying about your sexual preference in order to retain Dad’s favor is a prescription for a lifetime of deceit and, perhaps, self-loathing. The honorable thing to do, the decent thing to do, is to say something like: ‘‘Dad, I’m gay. Get over it. If you want to continue helping me, fine. If not, I’ll figure out how to make it on my own.’’ That kind of determination would be a solid step into true adulthood. And who knows? Someday his dad might come to respect his son for his honesty. Even if not, the son would be able to respect himself. Mike Moore, Green Valley, Ariz.

Since when do parents have an obligation to financially support their adult children? It’s admirable and wonderful, and yes, our system of university financing is backward, but does that create an obligation for parents? If so, then surely parents who fail to earn enough to pay college tuition for their children must be a disappointment, if not neglectful. Sean Hale, Austin, Tex.",REAL
How to Draw Like a Police Sketch Artist,"Photo

Sketching a likeness for a wanted poster is the easy part, according to Stephen Mancusi, a detective who worked as a forensic artist for the New York Police Department for almost 27 years. Getting a witness to describe the face of a perpetrator is the more difficult and nuanced skill. Start by taking five or six minutes to pencil in the shape of a head of average proportions. A face tends to equal five eye-lengths across, while the width of a mouth is about the distance between pupils. Draw quickly: The movement of graphite on paper can be hypnotic. ‘‘People lose themselves watching,’’ Mancusi says. As they do, they relax and remember.

Once you have a basic shape down, use outside materials to prompt specific visual recollections. If the assailant was a young white man, for example, Mancusi might show the victim hundreds of mug shots of white teenagers, with an instruction to scan for analogous features. Learn to spot trustworthy memories. If a hairdresser recounts an attacker’s dark, greasy ponytail, illustrate that. Hold off on the vague descriptions, the kind Mancusi dismisses as belonging to the lexicon of incertitude. ‘‘If someone says ‘almond eyes’ or ‘bow-shaped lips,’ I know we have nothing,’’ says Mancusi, who retired as the N.Y.P.D.’s senior artist in 2008 and will soon lead the International Association for Identification’s forensic-art certification board.

Remain detached. ‘‘That drawing is not yours; it is the victim’s,’’ Mancusi says. ‘‘You have to allow people to see it, change it, manipulate it.’’ Be ready with your erasers. Shading should be done last. Ask for feedback with open-ended questions. ‘‘Don’t say, ‘Do you think this nose is too big?’ Instead, ask, ‘How is this nose looking?’ ’’

If possible, interview your eyewitness within 24 hours of when something occurred and be prepared to sketch under any circumstances. Your goal is to transform a stranger’s memory into a recognizable face. To do that often requires collaborating with a traumatized, injured or scared person. Sometimes a sketch will make a witness weep. ‘‘You are dealing with human emotion,’’ Mancusi says. ‘‘What you’re doing is not science. It’s art.’’",REAL
What Is the Point of College?,"Together, these visions — Utility and Utopia — explain a great deal about modern colleges and universities. But taken singly, they lead to very different metrics for success.

Consider the declining proportion of fac­ulty with tenure. Tenured faculty are defined by more than the fact that they are hard to fire. Tenure allows professors to pursue intellectual projects without regard for what the trustees or the governor or the community care about. It gives them the kind of intellectual freedom that has helped make our universities the research powerhouses of the world. Adjunct faculty, on the other hand, are a lot less expensive — they’re paid less and typically lack health and other benefits — and you can easily expand or contract their ranks as demand fluctuates. In the Utility vision, students are consumers; they have needs and desires to be met, at a price they’ll pay. If pleasing the customer is the goal, a tenured faculty member who wants to teach what he or she considers worth teaching can be an inconvenience. Plus, at Utility U., one obvious way to better your ‘‘value proposition’’ is to cut costs. These days, three-quarters of the teaching faculty at America’s nonprofit colleges and universities are hired as adjuncts with no tenure and no research support. A few decades ago, only a quarter were.

At Utility U., the search for efficiency requires tools for evaluating teachers. Management, as the old saw has it, is measurement. Years ago, I was on a committee at a great university that looked into the system by which students evaluated courses. The most reliable predictor of whether students liked a course, it turned out, was their answer to the question ‘‘Did the professor respect you?’’ Customers like to be loved; attentive service makes for good Yelp reviews. But that’s a very different question from, say: How, if at all, did you change through the class? What good, if any, did those changes do you? Did you learn to uncover the ideological or conceptual demons that may be flummoxing your good sense? Mr. Chips’s encouraging smile has pedagogical value, but so, perhaps, does Professor Kingsfield’s basilisk stare.

If Utility U. is concerned with value, Utopia U. is concerned with values. The values agenda can involve the content of classes, the nature of campus communities or both. When I teach a seminar that deals with theories of identity and social justice, my aim is to provide tools of analysis so that students — men and women of various ethnic, religious and sexual descriptions — can sort through such issues by themselves. But class discussions aren’t always abstract and impersonal: Everyone has identity allegiances and intuitions about justice. And the same is true for discussions elsewhere on campus. At Utopia U., the aim is to create a safe space, to check your privilege and suspend the prejudices of the larger world, to promote human development and advance moral progress.

And so ‘‘civility’’ is on the agenda, ‘‘safe’’ spaces are spreading and microaggressions — possibly unintentional slights that stem from racial, ethnic or sexual difference — are to be scrutinized, sometimes through a jeweler’s loupe. It’s easy to roll your eyes at ‘‘social justice warriors,’’ but there’s a perfectly good idea here: People don’t think well when they feel personally insulted or aggrieved. And in classes, thinking well is the main objective. Buzzwords aside, a lot of this is just courtesy — Emily Post by way of Foucault. Still, the Utopians can be reluctant to admit that there may be conflicts between expanding civility and deepening understanding, between the safe-space ideal and the free-speech ideal. (Not a few campus quarrels come down to: Who’s silencing whom?) A culture of civility sometimes does make evasion easier. Students arrive from Cincinnati and Singapore and — finally! — discover a cohort of like-minded souls. That can be a thrill. Confine yourself to their company, though, and you’ve invented a new parochialism.

Neither Utility U. nor Utopia U. has the full run of any one campus. In the familiar caricature, there’s the performance-studies major who is putting up fliers for the Naomi Klein talk, collecting signatures for the fossil-free petition and wondering whether the student alliance for gender equity is as racially inclusive as it claims. Then there’s the engineering major, first in the family to go to college, traipsing across the quad with a discounted, two-editions-out-of-date version of the material-science textbook. All that identity stuff is a dimly perceived distraction in this student’s light cone, readily tuned out. One student thinks ‘‘bi-curious’’ is a word; the other doesn’t see why you would use molecular-orbital theory when valence bonding provides answers faster. The two students cross paths only physically. It’s almost as if they’re attending two different colleges.

One reason this is a caricature is that people aren’t always found on the expected side of the disciplinary (and class) divides. At liberal-arts campuses, certainly, almost everyone drinks from the fountain of human betterment, albeit some from a Dixie cup and others from a Big Gulp. And very few are completely unmindful of the getting-a-job thing that’s rumored to follow graduation. But when you superimpose the two visions of college — as a forcing house of virtue and as means for building human capital — you inevitably get interference patterns, ripples and ridges of indignation and disquiet. That’s what you’re seeing when the safe-space ethic runs amok, as with students who claim offense when their ideas are challenged or who want to see ‘‘trigger warnings’’ on even canonical literature, like those cardboard lids on hotel-room glasses. Here, the student is at once the sensitive servant of high causes and a demanding customer.

Nor are these tensions likely to resolve themselves, because higher education has to play so many roles. The truth is that colleges and universities do a tremendous amount that neither of these pictures captures — that just can’t be reduced to the well-being of their graduates. For one thing, the old ideal of knowledge for its own sake hasn’t been extinguished. For another, universities are the homes of all kinds of public goods. They are, for example, the source of much of today’s best research. Without them we would know much less than we do about the nature of the cosmos or the workings of the human brain or the ways of reading a novel. A flourishing literary culture is made possible not because institutions of higher learning create writers but because they prepare readers (and yes, it helps that they provide jobs for plenty of poets and novelists too). There’s even something to be said, especially in a democracy, for an educated citizenry, able to question the creeds of the moment.

Which brings us back to demons and doubt. Was there any point to studying such things? My first class of freshmen, all those years ago, certainly had reservations about Monsieur Descartes’s method of systematic doubt. Once they were reassured about their instructor’s sanity, though, they got into the spirit of things, and some, at least, came to see why epistemology — the study of knowledge — might be worthwhile. Maybe not practical … unless you were looking for a job as a professor. But interesting. Mind-expanding, even. Possibly, there was something to be said for the intellectual discipline of second-guessing what you thought was true. And that wasn’t just good for them. Who would want to live in a nation of people without doubts?

Is College Tuition Really Too High?,"The next educational marketplace consists of the large regional powerhouses, home to another 20 percent or so of the higher-ed student population. Usually public, with names that often begin with ‘‘University of,’’ these schools have strong reputations in their home states and often among the residents in neighboring states. The best ones are more likely to be found in the South or West. Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, both professors at Harvard and leading scholars of education economics, co-wrote a famous paper a few years ago in which they pointed out that states that had elite private schools in the 1890s are less likely to have developed these strong, upper-­tier public schools. The reason is as obvious as it is depressing: The powerful private schools lobbied politicians to keep public institutions underfunded. That helps explain why the university systems in North Carolina, Texas, Indiana, California and elsewhere outside the Northeast are held in such high regard. (The University of Massachusetts and SUNY systems, by contrast, do not have the same reputations.) Public universities have always been cheaper than their elite private counterparts, but the gap has been closing slowly as states stop funding the schools as generously as they once did.

Finally, there are the nonselective public, community and private for-profit colleges that admit nearly every paying applicant. A vast majority of people pursuing postsecondary education will start in these schools. They vary greatly in quality. Some provide a solid education, especially in technical expertise, that can lead to higher-paying, skilled jobs in manufacturing, health care and other fields. Some of these places, especially the private for-profit ones, seem to be little more than a scam, recruiting students, taking their government-funded loans and offering them a degree of minimal worth. Well more than half of all new students at four-year schools in this segment won’t finish. But still they will be burdened with debt or will default, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.

If colleges and universities were just another consumer good, like cars or clothes, we wouldn’t worry as much about their cost. The rich pay more for the best stuff; the poor pay less for the worst. That’s the market at work. But higher education is both an individual and a public concern.

We know this from historical experience. In 1900, less than 10 percent of the U.S. population had a high-school degree, and many couldn’t have received one if they wanted. There just weren’t enough public high schools. In the beginning of the 20th century, a nationwide effort was undertaken to provide free secondary schooling to every American child. By the end of World War II, half of all young American adults had high-school diplomas; by the 1970s, a vast majority did. The country’s rapid growth during that century — the rise of industry, the development of technology, the dawn of a vast middle class — would be hard to explain without acknowledging the spread of education as a cause. From 1900 to 1980, every generation born in the United States had about two more years of schooling than the one before. This transformed a nation of semiliterate farmers into the world’s most-educated country. But progress has slowed since 1980. In the 1970s, the United States ranked first globally for college attainment; today, among people 25 to 34, it ranks 14th, having fallen behind many other industrialized nations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has singled out the United States as being particularly deficient in one measure: the chances are greater than 70 percent that an American will not attend college if his or her parents do not have a college degree.

This history was laid out most clearly in the 2008 book ‘‘The Race Between Education and Technology,’’ by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, which transformed how economists think about education, individual success and our collective fortunes. Put simply: Without greater access to higher education, the United States is likely to have even greater income inequality, a huge segment of the population will see its income fall and some of our core assumptions about national identity — ours as a land of opportunity, a prosperous democracy — will be at risk.

Since the 1980s, most states have decreased their per-student spending on public higher education, some of them quite substantially. Federal aid has risen, but not enough to make up for the state cuts and significant increases in enrollment. Tuition, meanwhile, has gone up far more than inflation. For an explanation why that’s so, it’s helpful to identify analogues in the business world. Like hotels and apartment buildings, for example, colleges and universities own expensive real estate that is parceled out for use by paying customers; this means the overall rise in real estate costs have made running a university more expensive. Like airlines or Starbucks, they have a wide variety of customers with varying ability and willingness to pay. First-class and latte customers can be seduced into paying top dollar, but much of the revenue comes from people who can’t afford the fancy stuff and just want a seat in coach or a cup of coffee. Like sports teams or, for that matter, cigarette companies, schools obsessively tend to their reputations, hoping to build lifelong brand loyalty among their most fervent customers.

But probably the single most important factor behind the rise in tuition is one that few other businesses share: Students are not just customers; they are also an integral part of the core product. When considering a school, potential students and their parents often look first at the characteristics of past classes: test scores, grade-point averages, post-college earnings, as well as ethnic and gender mixes. School admissions officers call the process through which they put together their classes the ‘‘shaping’’ of the student body. Kevin Crockett is a consultant with Ruffalo Noel Levitz, a firm that helps colleges and universities set prices. He says that the higher the prices that schools charge, the more options they have in recruiting exactly the students they want.

‘‘I’ve got to have enough room under the top-line sticker price,’’ he says. A school that charges $50,000 is able to offer a huge range of inducements to different sorts of students: some could pay $10,000, others $30,000 or $40,000. And a handful can pay the full price.

There’s a provocative analogy to be made with how another industry does its pricing. I called Paul Norman, who owns a company that promotes high-end dance clubs in London, and he agrees that his clubs have much the same challenge as colleges and universities. Their appeal to new customers is based, in large part, on the mix of customers who are already there. The biggest spenders are wealthy men from Russia and the Middle East. But they won’t spend a lot of money in a club filled with people just like themselves. Women who have the right look — posh in Chelsea, a bit more flash in Mayfair — are admitted free and are offered free drinks, but only if they arrive early in the evening and happily mingle and dance. He said that clubs do their own version of enrollment shaping. ‘‘It’s good for the crowds if you have a mix of ethnicities,’’ Norman told me. On any given night, he said, about a quarter of the clubs’ guests get in free. It’s an odd model: giving your most valuable product away to some and charging a lot to others. But, Norman said, if everybody paid the same price, nobody would want to come, and in a few weeks clubs wouldn’t be able to charge anyone anything.

Similarly, if an elite school like Harvard or Princeton insisted on admitting only students willing to pay the full freight, they would soon find they weren’t so elite. Many of the best teachers would rather go elsewhere than stay in a gated, rich community. The most accomplished rich kids could be lured away to other schools by the prospect of studying with the best students and teachers. So, a school with the same high sticker price for everyone would be unlikely to have the attributes — high test scores, Nobel Prize-winning faculty, a lively culture — that draw national or international attention.

While blue-chip schools charge the most, their economic fundamentals suggest that they are, if anything, underpricing their product. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average bill at the top-tier schools is just over $50,000 a year. Yet these schools spend considerably more than $100,000 a year educating each student, with the difference made up from government funds, grants, alumni gifts and their often-huge endowments. Fewer than half of their students pay even that discounted amount. Most of the top-tier private schools say they won’t factor in an applicant’s ability to pay when considering admission and promise that everyone admitted will be given the financial aid necessary to attend. Generally, parents pay no more than 10 percent of their income. Students whose parents make less than $65,000 (or, at Stanford, $125,000) usually pay no tuition. And there are generous aid packages available to all but the very wealthiest students.

The pricing of college and university tuition used to be based on gut feelings, Crockett told me. Until around 1992, administrators would glance at what their peers were charging and come up with a number. Today, the process involves a level of mathematical and statistical rigor that few other industries could match. Crockett uses a team of statisticians and data analysts, the latest in software and data with hundreds of variables on students’ ability and willingness to pay, academic accomplishments, most likely choices of majors, ethnicity and gender, and other attributes. To the public, one number is released: the cost of tuition. But internally the school likely has dozens of price points, each set for a different group of potential students. The tools can determine how valuable a potential student is to the school’s overall reputation: more points for sports and scholarly accomplishment, fewer for the telltale signs of a likely dropout.

Because a majority of selective schools have adopted these sophisticated tools for shaping enrollment, there is more competition to attract the students who are most appealing: those with high G.P.A.s and test scores, high likelihood of graduating, the right sort of major — English majors, for example, effectively subsidize engineering students because engineering is more expensive to teach. Typically, fierce market competition leads to lower prices, but among elite schools, the opposite occurs, paradoxically. They often find that raising prices enables them to offer greater benefits to the most coveted potential students. (It also allows them to take part in the amenities race: nicer dorms, better food, a climbing wall: things that are regarded as essential to attracting those coveted students.)

Counterintuitively, the surest way to improve equality of access to elite schools might be to raise the cost of admission even further. Rich students paying the full price would make more aid, in money and educational support, available to be transferred to the best students from poor families and lower-performing schools. For most people who graduate from top-tier schools, debt is easily managed. Their average loan outstanding upon graduation is $23,000, but these students — no matter what they major in — get a high wage-premium, making an average of $20,000 a year more than they would have had they not gone to the school. Students entering college today are confronted with far more costs — the average textbook budget is $1,200 a year now — and this can be quite shocking to parents for whom college was much more affordable. And there are, no doubt, individual stories of deep hardship. But as a group, students who attend more-selective schools are among the luckiest in our society. In effect, they live in a different economy than the rest of the nation, one with a rich array of career opportunities, steadily rising wages and far less unemployment.

The midtier public schools face a different set of challenges. Their tuition increases are being driven largely by state governments’ unwillingness or inability to raise per-student financing. Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, says that in the 2001-2002 school year, public schools received from 44 percent to 62 percent of their funding from state governments. Only a decade later, those levels had decreased to 27 percent to 51 percent. On average, states have lowered their per-student funding by 25 percent over the last 15 years. Some — Louisiana, Wisconsin, Kansas and Arizona — have cut their support sharply in the past few years. The money allocated for public education is a tempting target for governors facing shortfalls. Education is one of the largest items in a state budget, and educators don’t have the same lobbying power as more concentrated business groups. Republican governors with national political aspirations have found that ‘‘taking on’’ public education can enhance their popularity among primary voters.

The economic thinking behind public-university cuts can be confusing. Studies have shown that cutting support for public education balances budgets only in the short term. In his book ‘‘Higher Learning, Greater Good,’’ Walter W. McMahon, emeritus professor of economics at the University of Illinois, showed that a postsecondary degree has a return on investment of roughly 15 percent a year, meaning that every $100 invested in education brings an additional $15 in income for every year of a person’s working life. This expands a state’s economy and generates enough tax revenue to more than pay back the initial outlay on education. Someone who graduates from a four-year institution earns about $1 million in additional future earnings.

Flagship public universities — like the University of California, Berkeley, or the Universities of Michigan and Virginia — often behave like elite private schools, using aid to attract the best students, typically the ones who would probably go to a decent school without government support.

That means that high-achieving students from educated families receive a disproportionate share of financial assistance, while those at the bottom, struggling students from families ill equipped to support their educations, receive a disproportionately small share. If you add up all the financial aid available from federal, state and local governments and from nonprofit institutions, there is enough money already out there to support everybody’s education. The problem is that aid is distributed unevenly.

Nonselective schools, the ones serving our most at-risk and in-need students, are struggling for money. Obama recently proposed making community college free for anyone able to maintain a G.P.A. of 2.5 while in school and whose parents make less than $200,000 a year. The program would be surprisingly cheap, costing around $6 billion annually, a pittance in the federal budget.

Still, it doesn’t fully address the crisis confronting our system of community colleges: Lots of people enter, but most won’t graduate. Some four-year schools have truly abysmal records when it comes to graduating their students in six years or less. Medgar Evers College in the CUNY system has a graduation rate of 8 percent as of 2013. Entire state public-university systems with collective graduation rates below 50 percent include Arkansas (39.7 percent), Montana (45.6 percent) and Alaska (30.6 percent). Baum says that among nonselective, four-year, for-profit schools, graduation rates above 50 percent are the exception, and a few, especially online schools, have rates well below 10 percent.

Nearly every education expert I spoke to mentioned a remarkable new program that has had the greatest success yet in improving the graduation rate of at-risk college enrollees. The experimental program was introduced at the community colleges of the City University of New York, where the overall graduation rate has been as low as 16 percent. CUNY administrators determined that many of their students don’t just need cheaper tuition. They need support. Coming from families and communities with few, if any, college graduates, they are poor and every day have to calculate the trade-off between investing in their long-term education and paying their short-term bills. CUNY’s Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) offered some common-sense interventions. Students received help paying their tuition and other fees; they even received free passes for public transportation. Most important, perhaps, they received what the school calls ‘‘mandatory and intrusive guidance’’ from counselors who helped them choose classes, get through rough patches and focus on the long-term benefits of finishing school. Three years into the program, an outside education-research firm began an experiment: A group of 900 entering freshmen, all of whom had developmental needs, was randomly assigned to ASAP. They and a comparison group that received no special intervention were monitored for three years. The graduation rate among ASAP students who achieved an associate’s degree in three years was twice as great as that of the comparison group. The overall ASAP graduation rate at CUNY has risen to 52 percent.

Henry Levin, an economist at Columbia University’s Teachers College, co-wrote an exhaustive analysis and concluded that, while it costs more upfront — at $19,000 a student, ASAP isn’t cheap — the benefits to New York taxpayers were great. Those with associate’s degrees would earn so much more over their lifetimes that they would pay an estimated $165,000 in additional taxes, while saving the state and city more than $40,000 in criminal justice, health and public-assistance costs. Pilot versions of the program are now being tried at several Ohio schools.

College aid — all the federal and state grants and subsidies, the various scholarships and aid packages offered by schools and foundations — evolved in piecemeal fashion over decades. Considered as a whole, it is a bizarre system. Students who go to private nonprofit schools, disproportionately children of middle-class and wealthy parents with college educations, receive an average of $25,000 a year in aid. Those who go to less-selective public schools receive an average of $13,500 a year. And students who attend public community colleges, who are most likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds and parents without college degrees, receive an average of $8,000 a year. In other words, our system gives three times as much aid to the least needy as it gives to the most.

This makes no economic sense: Once students drop out of community college, taxpayers will continue to pay their bills. That’s not called education funding; it’s called welfare or criminal-justice or health care expenditures. The difference is significant. In the language of economics, education funding is an investment; it more than pays back its initial costs over time. The other expenses are known as transfer payments; which means they make society poorer. In an economy that demands and rewards education, those who have it will pay the bills for those who don’t.",REAL
A Prescription for More Black Doctors,"Xavier University exists within a constellation of more than 100 schools federally designated as historically black colleges and universities. To achieve this designation, colleges must have opened before 1964 — the year Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, which banned racial discrimination in all public facilities and institutions — and must have been founded with the express purpose of educating black Americans, though students of any race can, and do, attend them.

The first of these historically black colleges, now called Cheyney University, was opened by a Quaker in Pennsylvania in 1837, at a time when black students were barred from most institutions of higher learning in the North and the South. But after the Civil War, colleges for black students proliferated across the South to serve the millions of newly freed people. They were founded by churches, philanthropists and the federal Freedmen’s Bureau, and then by states, after an 1890 federal law required states with segregated schools to open at least one black land-grant college. By the 1920s, black colleges dotted every Southern state and a few Northern ones.

Around that time, a nun named Katharine Drexel, an heiress to a Philadelphia banker who has since been sainted, used part of her inheritance to open Xavier for black Catholics in New Orleans who were not allowed to attend the white Catholic colleges in town. It remains the only black Catholic college in the country. Its mission is the same as every other historically black college. While many colleges were started to groom the children of the nation’s elite, the goal of historically black colleges has always been to pull up through education the nation’s most marginalized — first the children of former slaves, then the children of sharecroppers and maids and today the children of America’s still separate and unequal K-12 educational system.

Because of this mandate, the colleges have been one of the most important institutions in building the nation’s black middle class. The list of promi­nent Americans who studied within the classrooms of historically black colleges is striking. Among them are Julian Bond, Ta-­Nehisi Coates, Sean Combs, W.E.B. DuBois, Medgar Evers, Ralph Ellison, Nikki Giovanni, Alex Haley, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, James Weldon Johnson, Spike Lee, Toni Morrison, Oprah Winfrey, Marian Wright Edelman and Andrew Young.

The colleges, created as a result of the nation’s system of legal segregation, produced the very Americans who would eventually take down that system. Thurgood Marshall, who argued the Brown v. Board of Education case before the Supreme Court and later became its first black justice, went to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and Howard University’s law school. Four freshmen at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro started the large-scale sit-in movement in 1960. Two Fisk University students, Diane Nash and John Lewis, the long-­serving congressman, helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and were pivotal in the struggle for civil rights across the South. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is the most notable alumnus of one of these institutions; he entered Morehouse College in Atlanta at the age of 15.

With black students now attending schools that were once off limits, the percentage of black students who attend historically black colleges has declined from 90 percent in 1960 to just 11 percent today. But the role of these schools has not changed; they are still focused on addressing the needs of those whom privilege has passed over. Nearly three of four students at historically black colleges come from low-income families, compared with about half of all American college students, and most are still first-generation college attendees. Though the institutions account for just 3 percent of all colleges, they award 16 percent of the bachelor’s degrees earned by black students. Further, historically black colleges have always been incubators of black leadership; in the 1990s, the last time data was collected, graduates of these schools accounted for 80 percent of the nation’s black judges, 50 percent of black doctors and lawyers and 40 percent of black members of Congress. Along with Xavier, other historically black colleges like Morehouse, Howard, Hampton and Spelman are also among the top feeder schools for black medical students.

When that medical-­school report came across Francis’ desk all those years ago, he was certain of one thing: The small number of black students entering medical school was not a reflection of their capabilities. It was a reflection of the shoddy schooling so many of them received before they ever arrived at the college gate. If Xavier was going build a program to turn large numbers of its students into doctors, Francis knew the college was going to have to do more than just teach science. It was going to have to figure out how to overcome years of educational gaps.

Pierre Johnson was just the kind of student the college president had in mind. Johnson grew up in the 1980s on the South Side of Chicago, the oldest child of a single mother who emphasized the importance of education even as she battled drug addiction. School always came easy to Johnson; he worked hard in class and did his homework every night.

When Johnson was 10, his mother became pregnant, and he started accompanying her to doctor appointments. The science of how a tiny group of cells transforms in the womb into a baby, the magic and mystery of the birth process, fascinated him, and something else captured his attention, too, something he had never seen before. His mom’s obstetrician was a black man.

The little boy thought about the way the white doctors at the public clinic had treated his mom with indifference and often disdain. But this black doctor, ‘‘he didn’t look down on her,’’ Johnson recalled. ‘‘He knew she was a good woman who had a problem. And he gave me, at least, something to say: ‘I can do that.’ ’’ Johnson thought to himself that he would become a doctor, too.

A few years later, he enrolled at an all-black, mostly poor South Side high school, where he continued to excel in all his classes and dreamed of a life as a physician. On his own, he paged through college guides at the local library, looking for schools with strong pre-med programs. He came across Xavier, which boasted of sending the largest number of black graduates to medical school. He had never been to Louisiana, but he decided, ‘‘That’s where I’m going.’’

Johnson graduated second in his class in 1998. He headed to Xavier full of confidence and expectations. As he moved into his dorm, he found it invigorating to be around so many smart young black people with similar goals. He felt as though he fit in. And then he took his first college science classes. ‘‘It was a pure shock,’’ he said. ‘‘I was extremely unprepared. Stuff that kids knew from high school, general physics and chemistry, I had no idea, none. I had never done poorly academically my whole life, and I realized for four years of high school, I had never been challenged.’’ Johnson’s high school did not offer the Advanced Placement chemistry and biology classes that some of his Xavier classmates had taken. But it was worse than that. Johnson’s high school did not even offer the basic high-school courses, like physics, that are needed to succeed in a typical pre-med program. ‘‘I wanted to be a doctor,’’ he said. ‘‘But I did not even know what the periodic table was.’’

Johnson’s experience is depressingly familiar to Francis. While many students at Xavier and other historically black colleges come from middle-­class homes, have gone to good schools and have parents who graduated from college, too many do not. ‘‘I used to say there was no relationship between being poor and being bright. I watched all of my life young people who were poor and very bright. But research shows if you are black and born poor, you are going to live in a poor neighborhood, going to go to a poor school, and by and large, you are going to stay that way,’’ Francis said. ‘‘To come out of that system, you would have to rise much higher than other youngsters who had every resource.’’

During Francis’ decades at Xavier, racial disparities in K-12 education remained firmly entrenched. Black public-­school students are more segregated now than at any time since the mid-1970s. Instead of receiving more resources to help them succeed, black students, almost without exception, get less. National data from the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights show that black students are the least likely to attend high schools that offer algebra, physics and chemistry. A report released in July by the ACT and the United Negro College Fund laid out the tragic consequences: Nearly two-thirds of black students who took the ACT did not meet any of the test’s college-­readiness benchmarks, twice the national average.

At Xavier, Johnson found himself the embodiment of those statistics, and he was reeling. As he sat in his general biology and chemistry classes, in which even basic concepts were unfamiliar, he tried to quiet the rising panic, thinking that if he did what he had always done, just worked harder, he would get it. A few short months earlier, he was among the smartest kids in school; now he found himself studying all night only to eke out C’s and D’s on the weekly quizzes given by his professors. Johnson realized that if he was going to make it, he needed help. He scheduled an appointment with Professor J.W. Carmichael.

Carmichael, a chemistry professor, arrived at Xavier in 1970, not long after Francis was named president. At the time, Carmichael was young, untenured and brashly outspoken about what the college could be doing to place more of its students in medical schools. Despite its rigorous science program, Xavier was sending only about five to eight graduates to medical school each year.

Carmichael’s candor caught Francis’ attention, and he chose him to run the pre-med program and implement his vision. Francis believed that Xavier should not follow the example of most pre-med programs — ‘‘Look to your left, look to your right; only one of you will still be here at the end’’ — which work to weed out students. To him, that model squandered the talent of far too many students, especially black ones. Instead of compelling students to compete against one another, he said, it made much more sense, both morally and practically, to encourage better-­prepared students to help their classmates who weren’t as fortunate to catch up.

Carmichael, who is in his 70s now, is short and a bit frumpy and wears oversize glasses. He is white and grew up in a poor family in rural New Mexico, and he knew something about what students like Johnson experienced when they arrived at college. As the new pre-med adviser, Carmichael worked with faculty members across the sciences to set up a highly structured system to address students’ problems early and direct them toward help.

When Johnson walked through the door of Carmichael’s office, it meant the program was working as planned. The quizzes Johnson did so poorly on in his first few weeks were designed as part of Xavier’s early-­alert system. Carmichael believed that a student needed to know he was failing long before he took his midterm exam. He connected Johnson to tutoring centers set up for each of his science courses. There, Johnson met students from other classes, and they began holding large study groups led by a particularly brilliant classmate who would quickly learn the material and then teach it to others. Students would stay up until the wee hours of the morning helping one another. ‘‘You have almost a hundred kids asking questions, discussing the material,’’ Johnson said. ‘‘To see the material broken down that way was just amazing. And if you didn’t get it, they’d explain it again. And if you still didn’t get it, they’d explain it again.’’

These study groups encouraged just the sort of collaboration Francis had imagined. ‘‘It took the competition out of it,’’ Johnson said. ‘‘It wasn’t, ‘I’m mad because you got an A.’ It was, ‘How do we both do that on the next test?’ We had this feeling if we all stuck together and helped each other, we would make it.’’ Marybeth Gasman, an education professor and the head of the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Minority Serving Institutions, which does research on and assists colleges that serve large numbers of black, Latino, Asian and Native American students, has carefully examined Xavier’s program and says no school is better at developing students’ shared responsibility for one another’s success. ‘‘It is dumbfounding to see,’’ she said.

What makes Xavier’s program most unusual is its strictly tailored uniform curriculum in freshman chemistry and biology. The faculty members collaborate on what they will teach and create a workbook for these courses that every professor must use. If professors want to teach something not in a workbook, they must present it to the faculty group for approval. The workbooks take the complicated material in science textbooks, which often overwhelms students, and specifies, step by step, everything students need to know for the class. The faculty members then incorporate regular tests and drills, not only to assess students but also to evaluate whether professors need to adjust their teaching. ‘‘This is fundamentally different than the way curriculum is taught across the country,’’ Gasman said. ‘‘What happens with faculty in general: We don’t want anyone telling us what to do in our classes; we pick our textbooks; we know what is right for our students. But they teach to where the students are and not just the way they want to teach.’’

For Johnson, when the workbooks and the study groups weren’t enough, he would spend hours after class in his professors’ offices as they patiently walked him through the material. By the second semester, Johnson was exhausted, but he was earning A’s and B’s again.

Excelling in biology and chemistry is only part of what gets students into medical school. Just as critical to Xavier’s success is the blueprint it created to help students navigate every step in the process of becoming desirable medical-­school candidates. ‘‘Our formula is built on believing there is no point in time where a pre-med student at this university shouldn’t know what they ought to be doing to get into medical school,’’ Quo Vadis Webster, Xavier’s current pre-med adviser, told me. By the end of the first semester, Johnson and other pre-med students needed to turn in the first of many personal statements that were critiqued by the university’s writing center. These essays, written and rewritten several times, would eventually become the ones included in their medical-­school applications.

Johnson attended weekly meetings with Carmichael, at which he continually received checklists and timelines, learned of research and internship opportunities and met graduates who spoke firsthand about getting into medical school. The pre-med office had Johnson and his classmates gather their letters of recommendation early, made sure they were good enough and then kept them on file until they were needed. Johnson prepared for his MCATs with the help of professors, whom Carmichael had instructed to take the exams themselves so they would know what their students should expect. Wearing a suit and tie, Johnson took part in mock interviews. And when the time came, Carmichael looked over every inch of Johnson’s application to make sure it would pass muster before he sent it out. Webster noted that wealthy students at elite schools pay thousands of dollars to agencies that help perfect their medical-­school applications and for courses that help prepare them for the medical exams. Xavier’s pre-med office, with a dedicated staff of two, provides nearly all of these services free.

Former students told me again and again that Carmichael’s involvement was something akin to fierce parenting; he believed in his students and would not let them fail. He would stand in the hall, near a wall decorated with the photos of smiling Xavierites who had become doctors, and reprimand students who professors reported had missed a class or a deadline. Students had to turn in cards signed by their professors showing how they had done on quizzes. Carmichael would send letters to parents on brightly colored paper saying, ‘‘Your child wants to go to medical school,’’ but warning that for some reason, the student hadn’t done x, y and z. If that didn’t work, he would pick up the phone and call a student’s home. ‘‘There is a constant monitoring,’’ Francis said. ‘‘We expect you to learn, and if you need support, you are going to get it.’’ He has a name for this system: love and pain.

The system worked for Johnson. After his rocky start, he graduated from Xavier on time in 2002 with a B average. Though the holes in his education continued to challenge him — he had to take the MCATs three times — he attended medical school at the University of Illinois in Peoria, where he was the only black student in his class. It was jarring to go there from Xavier’s nurturing environment. Johnson said he felt like a man on an island; no one seemed to care if he succeeded or failed. But he pressed on, and two years ago, Johnson, who is now 35, completed his ob-gyn residency. He works in a practice in Decatur, Ill., where he sees mothers with sons who remind him of his 10-year-old self, before he learned how hard it would be for a kid like him to become a doctor. Without Xavier, he said, ‘‘I wouldn’t have made it.’’

Historically black colleges like Xavier have written the guidebook on how to educate the nation’s neediest students, but they have always done so with less, and many of these schools are now struggling to survive. Though federal law required states to treat them and predominantly white colleges equally, states never did. Lawsuits over the years have argued that states still fail to do so. In 2004, Mississippi agreed to pay three historically black colleges $503 million when it settled a 30-year-old lawsuit accusing the state of discrimination in how it funded and supported its black public colleges. Alabama settled a similar case in 2006, and in 2013, a federal judge found that Maryland discriminated against its historically black colleges. Louisiana is home to three public, four-year historically black colleges. Last year, the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education published a study showing that while these three colleges awarded 40 percent of all bachelor’s degrees earned by black students at the state’s public universities, they bore the largest percentage of state funding cuts.

As they have fought to get their equal share of government funding, these colleges have also struggled to build endowments. Nationally, black students are the most likely to borrow money to pay for school, and they also graduate with the highest student-­loan debt. That means it takes them much longer before they can write checks to their alma maters instead of to their loan holders. Although the colleges helped build the black middle class, the black middle class is often not in a position to give back. Even in the best of economic times, the unemployment rate for black college graduates is more than twice that of white college graduates. An August study released by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis found that a college degree did little to protect black wealth — the median net worth of black college graduates dropped nearly 56 percent from 1992 to 2013, while it rose 86 percent for white college graduates during that same pe­riod. The average black family has managed to accumulate about $7,000 in wealth, compared with $111,000 for the average white household, making it difficult for historically black colleges to find parents and grandparents affluent enough to write big checks for buildings, programs and scholarships. Alumni do give, Francis said, but the donations are often small.

The endowments at the nation’s black colleges reflect this stark reality. Howard University in Washington has the largest endowment of all the colleges by far, at $586 million. (The largest endowment among historically white institutions is Harvard’s $32 billion.) Over all, the gap between the endowments of historically black colleges and others has doubled in the last two decades.

Without big endowments, the colleges rely heavily on tuition, making them extremely vulnerable to stagnating or declining enrollments. Because they are designed to serve students with little wealth, they cannot make up the shortfall by raising tuition. The average tuition of private historically black colleges is half that of private predominantly white colleges. This means they are often not in a position to pay competitive faculty salaries and build the fancy buildings and other facilities that college students shop for.

Families of students at historically black colleges rely heavily on PLUS loans, federal loans that parents can take out to help pay their children’s tuition. In recent years, the tightening of lending criteria for PLUS loans has caused a sharp drop in enrollment at historically black colleges. In 2012, the Education Department rejected the PLUS loan applications of 14,616 students going to historically black colleges, costing the institutions an estimated $168 million.

Some of the colleges, both private and public, have started buckling under the financial pressures of meeting very high student need with very few resources. Morehouse College laid off some 50 staff members in 2012. The South Caro­lina Legislature threatened to shutter for a year the state’s only public historically black college, South Carolina State University, because it could no longer pay its bills after years of declining enrollment and funding cuts. In 2013, after Grambling State University in Louisiana lost one-third of its state funding over five years, the football team protested its crumbling facilities and 31-hour bus rides to other schools by refusing to travel to a game. Cheyney State, the first historically black college, is deeply in debt, and a Pennsylvania state auditor has called the school’s outlook ‘‘bleak.’’ The most unthinkable occurred in 2013, when a board member at Howard, long considered the black Harvard, warned that without significant changes, the venerable institution would be insolvent within a few years.

Xavier is trying to weather its own financial struggles. The university reached its highest enrollment in school history, some 4,100 students, in August 2005. Two weeks later, Hurricane Katrina hit, swamping the campus under as much as six feet of water. Xavier was forced to make repairs and take out loans. One thousand students never came back. ‘‘Our enrollment is at a standstill,’’ Francis said. ‘‘The next few years are going to be very difficult for small schools, and particularly for black schools.’’

This summer, in the weeks before he stepped down as the longest-­serving college president in the United States, Francis traveled across the country on what he called a legacy tour, visiting alumni and raising money for a scholarship campaign. Under his tenure, the school has helped produce thousands of doctors, enrollment has more than doubled and the endowment has grown from $2 million when he started to $161 million today.

But sitting in his cool dining room this summer, Francis said he also felt discouraged. With just 3,000 students, Xavier is ‘‘too small to be the No.1 institution sending African-­American students to medical school.’’ The college’s ranking, he said, says as much about America’s failure as it does about Xavier’s success.

Despite all of Francis’ efforts, and those of other historically black colleges, the number of black doctors is still meager; black Americans make up 13 percent of the population but account for barely 4 percent of the nation’s doctors — about the same as it has been for decades.

In August, just weeks after Francis retired, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the same organization that issued the report some 40 years earlier that he took as a call to act, published another report. Just 515 black men entered medical school last year. Even though the nation’s black population is much larger now, that number is 27 fewer than the 542 black men who went to medical school in 1978.

The way Francis sees it, those statistics should be the nation’s shame. American schools have not absorbed the lessons that historically black colleges have to teach about how to better develop and support talented students stifled in poor communities across the land. Too many universities, he said, are content to recruit the most privileged and high-­achieving students in the United States and other countries. He said he saw historically black colleges ‘‘as the conscience of the nation.’’ But, he added, ‘‘I am not as sanguine about whether this nation fully understands the role we play — what we’ve done for this country with so little.’’",REAL
"If You Build It, They Will Come ... Won’t They?","Since the 1970s, when declining state funding and the replacement of federal grants with private loans began to raise the cost of going to college, universities, especially public ones, have tried to attract higher-­paying students. They often come from out of state and, increasingly, from out of the country. (There are 1.1 million foreign students in America, an 85 percent increase since 2005, with the largest contingent coming from China.) Attracting more students also means attracting more applicants, while still keeping the acceptance rate relatively low — a way of increasing the university’s selectivity and potentially improving its rank on the influential U.S. News and World Report list of universities. The University of Cincinnati first entered the list at No.156 in 2011 and reached the 129th spot in 2015. Its tuition has gradually risen, and its acceptance rate declined from 82 percent in 2002 to 73 percent in 2013. The number of out-­of-­state students increased 8.3 percent last year.

The hope is that buildings by starchitects will turn the University of Cincinnati into a desirable, glamorous place to spend four years living and studying. Mayne’s imposing Campus Recreation Center — which includes four stories of housing, six basketball courts, lecture halls and bleachers for the football stadium — represents the university’s commitment to improving the ‘‘campus experience.’’ Sparkling new buildings encourage sparkling new neighborhoods. Just south of the university in the Clifton Heights neighborhood, a two-block retail, housing and entertainment complex called U Square @ the Loop, replete with a craft-beer emporium and a yoga studio, recently opened. It is part of a wider development of the area, where campus police patrols have also increased. (In July, a 43-year-old black man was shot and killed by a white campus officer in the nearby Mount Auburn neighborhood.) The university and its students now visibly set themselves apart from surrounding communities.

But expansion can come at a cost. Peter Eisenman’s Aronoff Center for Design and Art at the university had cheap cladding slapped on during its construction from 1989 to 1996, and over time it began to rot and peel away. Repairs and renovations on the $35 million building cost $20 million, and the university borrowed $19.25 million to help pay for them. The university now has $1.1 billion in debt — close to 20 percent more than it had in 2004 — largely because of its construction boom. During the same time, enrollment has increased by nearly 30 percent. The spending is predicated on the idea that new buildings can help turn provincial universities into outré, worldly ‘‘academical villages.’’ It’s a financial gamble — one that many public institutions find themselves driven to make. And it also threatens something more abstract but no less fundamental: that the university will turn into a luxury brand, its image unmoored from its educational mission — a campus that could be anywhere and nowhere.",REAL
The Return of the Sex Wars,"Around the same time, activism by student survivor groups intensified. At Columbia University last fall, Emma Sulkowicz began carrying a mattress in a piece of performance art that doubled as a protest against the university, which cleared a fellow student she accused of rape. At the University of Virginia, a searing tale of a fraternity gang rape exploded in November onto the pages of Rolling Stone. And in the spring, students at Northwestern University held a rally and filed a complaint protesting an essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education by the film professor Laura Kipnis, who criticized university bans on faculty-student relationships and expressed puzzlement over student requests not to watch movies, assigned for class, that they felt ‘‘ ‘triggered’ something for them.’’ ‘‘The feminism I identified with as a student stressed independence and resilience,’’ Kipnis wrote. ‘‘In the intervening years, the climate of sanctimony about student vulnerability has grown too thick to penetrate.’’ Outraged by the ‘‘violence expressed by Kipnis’s message,’’ the students petitioned the university to issue ‘‘a swift, official condemnation,’’ adding, ‘‘We demand that in the future, this sort of response comes automatically.’’

Photo

Concerned that the students had gone too far, liberal and conservative faculty members and commentators rallied around Kipnis. ‘‘The reaction to Kipnis — the demands for official censure, the claims of emotional injury — demonstrated how correct she is about the broader climate,’’ Michelle Goldberg wrote in The Nation. Other doubts about the tactics of the survivor movement, if not its goals, were also simmering. Male students, including the classmate Sulkowicz accused at Columbia, Paul Nungesser, have sued their universities, arguing that the new ‘‘victim-centered’’ policies are biased. Facing doubts about the veracity of facts provided by the woman who claimed she was victimized, Rolling Stone was forced to retract its story of gang rape and to acknowledge that it relied on the anonymous woman’s account without adequately trying to corroborate it.

Amid this controversy, the letter the Harvard law professors published in The Globe was a sign that universities, striving to address campus sexual violence, could find themselves under attack from all sides. Harvard has defended its procedures; a spokesman says the university has been ‘‘at the forefront of campus efforts’’ to prevent and respond to sexual assault and harassment. But Halley’s critique has reverberated — as the latest salvo in a long-running war, with deep intellectual roots, over how to grapple with rape and sex as a feminist.

In the late 1970s, when Janet Halley was writing a dissertation on 17th-century poets like Donne and Milton, a young lawyer and political scholar named Catharine MacKinnon opened new possibilities for the women’s movement by conceiving the legal claim for sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination — before this, an employee who lost her job for refusing to sleep with her boss had no way to succeed in court. MacKinnon’s work made her the central figure in the emerging field of feminist legal theory. She cemented that status over the following decade by developing an overarching theory of inequality. Women lived in a state of subordination, Mac­Kinnon argued, with pornography, sexual harassment, prostitution, child sexual abuse, domestic violence and rape as core elements in male domination.

Photo

Within this hierarchy, inequality functioned as a form of coercion, and a woman’s consent to sex, as defined by the law, did not necessarily mean that she was not raped. ‘‘The unquestionable starting point has been that rape is defined as distinct from intercourse,’’ MacKinnon wrote in her 1989 book, ‘‘Toward a Feminist Theory of the State,’’ ‘‘while for women it is difficult to distinguish the two under conditions of male dominance.’’

MacKinnon described her theory as the ‘‘dominance approach,’’ and it came to be known as ‘‘dominance feminism’’ — a term she says she doesn’t like, because ‘‘it’s as much about subordination as dominance.’’ Linda Boreman, featured in the 1972 hard-core porn movie ‘‘Deep Throat’’ under her stage name, Linda Lovelace, contacted MacKinnon, saying that men had coerced her into making the film, and MacKinnon began representing her. At the invitation of the Minneapolis City Council, MacKinnon worked with the writer Andrea Dworkin — they taught together at the University of Minnesota — to draft an ordinance that allowed people to sue the makers and distributors of pornography, defined as the ‘‘sexually explicit subordination of women.’’ The mayor of Minneapolis vetoed the ordinance, but in Indianapolis, the conservative City Council and mayor enacted a similar one. In response, a group of more than 50 feminists, including Betty Friedan and Adrienne Rich, signed a statement opposing the ordinance for potentially censoring speech and for accepting sexist stereotypes. MacKinnon fired back, accusing her opponents of ‘‘fronting for male supremacy.’’

The Indianapolis law was struck down in court, but within the women’s movement, the war waged on. A group calling themselves ‘‘sex-positive’’ feminists took aim at MacKinnon and Dworkin for turning sex into the enemy. Some sex-positivists were lesbians who identified with the politics of the gay male bathhouse, where people gathered for sexual freedom. Others were straight women who had learned from feminism to connect with their bodies. ‘‘A lot of girls don’t grow up knowing they have a clitoris,’’ Candida Royalle, who became a director of adult films geared toward couples, said in ‘‘Female Chauvinist Pigs,’’ Ariel Levy’s 2005 book about shifting perceptions of feminism. For Royalle, celebrating all kinds of female desire was central to women’s liberation. (She died this week.)

At the time, in the early to mid-1980s, Halley was a dominance feminist, teaching English at Hamilton College in New York. ‘‘My tools of analysis led me to be very suspicious — even if something seemed innocuous, it was really male domination working its way in,’’ she said. But slowly other influences complicated her thinking. She read sex-positive writers like Carole Vance, who edited a collection of essays called ‘‘Pleasure and Danger.’’ Vance explained the title: ‘‘To speak only of sexual violence and oppression ignores women’s experience of sexual agency and choice and unwittingly increases the sexual terror and despair in which women live.’’ Halley started thinking that sex, in all its chosen permutations, ‘‘could be a force for good.’’ She also had gay male friends who felt alienated by the women’s movement. They saw gender as fluid rather than binary. ‘‘I was part of the queer wave that crested in the ’90s, and the idea that it wasn’t just women and men, that people had all kinds of different identities — that all made sense to me,’’ Halley said. She started eschewing the labels of gay and straight. She believed that both men and women could use power and violence against each other, and she wanted feminists to recognize this.

Halley decided to go to law school, and when she turned to legal scholarship, she proved herself partly by taking on MacKinnon. In 1997, the Supreme Court heard the case of Joseph Oncale, a former oil-rig worker who brought a sexual-harassment claim charging that his co-workers on an all-male crew taunted him, threatened to rape him, pinned him down in the shower and assaulted him. Asked to help with the case, MacKinnon filed a brief arguing, among other things, that Oncale was a victim of sex discrimination because men like him are ‘‘feminized: made to serve the function and play the role customarily assigned to women as men’s social inferiors.’’

Some gay rights groups signed the brief. But Halley saw trouble brewing for sexual minorities. She wrote an incendiary essay, published in the 2003 collection ‘‘Directions in Sexual Harassment Law.’’ In it, she called MacKinnon’s approach ‘‘a big mistake’’ that opened ‘‘a quick and easy route to homophobia.’’ In her brief, MacKinnon said that the sexual orientation of Oncale and his attackers was legally irrelevant. Halley, however, singled out a footnote in which MacKinnon quoted Oncale’s testimony that he thought his attackers were homosexuals. Halley said the footnote implied that the men were gay and therefore deviant wrongdoers.

MacKinnon and others rejected Halley’s reading, but Halley went further, widening the scope of her attack. She voiced increasing suspicion of sexual-harassment law more generally, worrying that it reinforced repressive ideas about what was normal and what was deviant. She also objected to the way in which she thought dominance feminists saw women primarily in terms of innocence and injury, treating an experience of sexual violence as a focal point of identity. ‘‘Representing women as end points of pain,’’ feminists refuse to see women ‘‘as powerful actors,’’ Halley wrote in her book. ‘‘Feminism objectifies women, feminism erases their agency — could that be right?’’

Halley’s skepticism about using law to fight female inequality is out of sync with many feminists in the legal academy, who argue that she is also out of sync with many women. ‘‘The actual lived experience of real women is that they often are the victims of sexual violence,’’ said Michele Dauber, a Stanford law professor who helped rewrite the university’s policies on sexual harassment and assault and teaches a course on the issues. ‘‘It’s absurd to say that it undermines women’s agency to give them a tool to stop that bad thing from happening. People are suffering from harm, you provide them with a remedy, and somehow that’s infantilizing? No, it’s empowering.’’

Halley and MacKinnon are both on Harvard’s campus these days, Halley full time and MacKinnon, who is 68 and has tenure at the University of Michigan, for one semester a year. Some students say Halley can be unyielding, but she also listens well; she’s often seen walking her pair of golden retrievers on campus. MacKinnon's formidable ideas and reputation, as well as her teaching style, limit the interplay of ideas among students in the classroom, some of them say, though one student described her class as ‘‘transformative.’’

Standing at feminism’s outer poles, Mac­Kinnon and Halley loom large for students in debates about gender at Harvard Law School. For some feminist students, the division between the two camps is intensely frustrating. ‘‘Harvard is turning out generations of high-powered leaders who think feminists are extremists, because they’re mostly only hearing from Halley on one side and MacKinnon on the other,’’ said one recent graduate, who did not want her name used because she feared professional repercussions. The split, she added, hinders ‘‘problem solving, community building, finding allies — all the gushy stuff that actually leads to change.’’

Nationally, the leaders of the survivor movement include law students for whom MacKinnon is an intellectual touchstone. ‘‘She resonates with us for recognizing the way sexual violence holds back individuals and classes of marginalized people from flourishing,’’ said Alexandra Brodsky, a co-founder of the group Know Your IX. (Title IX is the federal law that provides for equal access to education.) ‘‘That feels very real to students. It’s not abstract when you’re failing out of school because you have to share a library with your rapist.’’ (Brodsky, a law student at Yale, took a writing course that I teach there.)

Like MacKinnon, student activists see the law as a tool of resistance against oppression, usually though not exclusively perpetrated by men. (Today’s activists include L.G.B.T.Q. students, and the movement makes plenty of room for their experiences.) Student editors of The Yale Law Journal asked MacKinnon to speak at a conference on Title IX at the end of September and invited her to contribute to the journal for the first time since 1991. Halley was not invited. The appreciation between MacKinnon and these student activists runs both ways. ‘‘I’m flat-out inspired by these girls,’’ MacKinnon said when I called her last spring.

The influence of the survivor movement is particularly apparent in how schools have broached the topic of drinking in the context of sexual assault. ‘‘Alcohol is the No. 1 ‘date rape drug,’ and is often used as a tool to commit an assault,’’ states the website of the University of New Hampshire, a national leader in sexual-assault prevention. But it’s harder for schools to talk about voluntary drinking by women. Student activists object to rape-prevention programs incorporating warnings about the risk heavy drinking poses. They say that questioning how much a female student drinks is like questioning her choice to wear a short skirt — just another form of victim blaming.

In times past, feminists urged self-reliance as a means of fighting rape — through, for example, self-defense classes. In June, The New England Journal of Medicine published a study of a Canadian program that cut the risk of rape by nearly half, and the rate of attempted rape by even more. In four three-hour sessions, the program trained female students on assessing risk among male acquaintances, overcoming obstacles to resisting coercion, practicing verbal and physical resistance and focusing on their own desires and relationship values. ‘‘Effective interventions focusing on men’s behavior are also needed,’’ the authors of the study said. Yet student activists argue that the burden should be almost entirely on men to stop sexually assaulting women, not on women to keep themselves out of danger. ‘‘If someone is so incapacitated they can’t stand up or use their words, then you should not be having sex with that person,’’ said Jessica Fournier, a Harvard junior who belongs to the survivor group Our Harvard Can Do Better. ‘‘That’s where the focus needs to be. That’s much more effective than giving out a list of 5,000 things victims shouldn’t do.’’

To Halley, it’s strange to hear feminists appealing to men to change their behavior while leaving women out of the equation. ‘‘I’m really troubled by this trend in which women are helpless and passive and men are the big responsible protectors,’’ she said. ‘‘That’s the ideology of the gilded cage. It’s astonishing to see feminists reawakening it uncritically. If young people are going to have a robust role in creating the conditions they want to live in, feminists have to call off this ban on discussing the risks and the moral ambiguities that come up with excessive alcohol use.’’

On this point, she has support among liberal feminists. ‘‘Schools have been reluctant to incorporate issues of alcohol abuse in rape-prevention programs out of concern that victims will be blamed, and blame themselves, for assault,’’ writes the Stanford law professor Deborah Rhode, who has advocated women’s advancement in the legal profession throughout her career, in a forthcoming article in The U.C.L.A. Women’s Law Journal. ‘‘That needs to change. Warning women that intoxication increases their risk of sexual assault does not imply that they are responsible for it.’’ The Yale law professor Reva Siegel, who coedited the 2003 essay collection on sexual-harassment law with MacKinnon, wants schools to expend more resources on prevention efforts, rather than channeling a vast majority of their time and money into punishment after the fact. ‘‘Universities have to make sure they balance punishment with acting preventatively, by enlisting students in an ongoing debate about their own culture,’’ she said. Prevention, Siegel argues, is crucial to achieve equality — which is the purpose, after all, of Title IX.

In many ways, the discussion about how to reduce sexual assault is only just beginning. Halley is gaining an audience among university administrators not unlike the one MacKinnon is having with student activists. She traveled to Roanoke College and the University of Chicago in the last year to talk about her ideas for ensuring that university policies are fair to both sides. Harvard conducted a universitywide survey on sexual assault earlier this year and is keeping statistics on the race of accused students and possible victims. The number of students filing formal complaints has risen. Recently, Harvard Law School broke from the university, announcing different procedures for its own students, which include providing lawyers to those who cannot afford them and hiring independent adjudicators with legal training (like retired judges) to hear and decide cases. The changes at the law school have Mac­Kinnon’s support as well as Halley’s. It’s a rare and productive moment: two opposing views of feminism coming together.",REAL
"Why We Should Fear University, Inc.","Defenders of the current state of campus politics are right to combat the insulting presumption that today’s undergraduates are oversensitive and incurious, correctly insisting that many of our college students are smart and committed to the fair exchange of ideas. But these defenders ignore the very real threat that student activism poses to intellectual and political freedom on campus, which is the firmament of academic inquiry. Critics are right to note that there is an unhealthy sensitivity to perceived offense on campus, a sense of ambient incrimination that does more to pre-empt potentially unpopular ideas than to punish the ones that are actually expressed. Yet those critics are strangely quiet about the structural racism and sexism, and other forms of inequality, that shape life on the average college campus.

This debate focuses far too much on personality flaws and individual agency. In so doing, critics of campus political culture almost always misidentify where the problems arise: not from passionate student activists, though like all activists, they can sometimes be misguided, but from corporatism, the corporatism that has come to infect the soul of the American university.

Consider, for example, the infamous case of Laura Kipnis, a professor of film at Northwestern University. In February, she published an essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education lamenting a supposed culture of sexual panic on campus. Writing in response to a student-requested administrative ban on student-faculty relationships, Kipnis argued that such relationships were not inherently destructive or exploitative. She further argued that the common contemporary perception that colleges are sites of mass sexual exploitation is indicative of a new Victorian take on the sexual lives of young adults. While making her case, Kipnis presented a not entirely sympathetic summary of a complaint of unwanted sexual interest that had been made by a Northwestern undergraduate against a philosophy professor. In response, students held a protest, some of them carrying mattresses, calling for formal censure of Kipnis. Worse, multiple Title IX complaints were filed against Kipnis, claiming that her essay had created a ‘‘chilling effect’’ that prevented students from feeling safe to pursue claims of sexual harassment or abuse. Incredibly, another university employee who attended Kipnis’s Title IX hearings in her support also had Title IX charges filed against him. Kipnis was initially unable to even know the names of her accusers.

The Kipnis affair was extreme, but it demonstrates the double-edged sword that is Title IX. The law, designed to enforce gender equality on campus, grants members of campus communities broad latitude in charging gender discrimination and mandates formal response from universities. The law can be a powerful tool for justice, but like all tools, it can be misused — especially as it ends up wielded by administrative and governmental functionaries. In this way, it becomes an instrument of power, not of the powerless. And because the law compels the self-protective, legalistic wings of universities to grind into gear, for fear of liability and bad publicity, invocations of Title IX frequently wrest control of the process and the narrative from student activists themselves, handing it to bureaucrats, whether governmental or institutional.

Rather than painting student activists as censors — trying to dictate who has the right to say what and when — we should instead see them as trapped in a corporate architecture of managing offense. Have you ever been to corporate sexual harassment training? If you have, you may have been struck by how little such events have to do with preventing sexual harassment as a matter of moral necessity and how much they have to do with protecting whatever institution is mandating it. Of course, sexual harassment is a real and vexing problem, not merely on campus but in all kinds of organizations, and the urge to oppose it through policy is a noble one. But corporate entities serve corporate interests, not those of the individuals within them, and so these efforts are often designed to spare the institutions from legal liability rather than protect the individuals who would be harmed by sexual harassment. Indeed, this is the very lifeblood of corporatism: creating systems and procedures that sacrifice the needs of humans to the needs of institutions.

If students have adopted a litigious approach to regulating campus life, they are only working within the culture that colleges have built for them. When your environment so deeply resembles a Fortune 500 company, it makes sense to take every complaint straight to H.R. I don’t excuse students who so zealously pursue their vision of campus life that they file Title IX complaints against people whose opinions they don’t like. But I recognize their behavior as a rational response within a bureaucracy. It’s hard to blame people within a system — particularly people so young — who take advantage of structures they’ve been told exist to help them. The problem is that these structures exist for the institutions themselves, and thus the erosion of political freedom is ultimately a consequence of the institutions. When we identify students as the real threat to intellectual freedom on campus, we’re almost always looking in the wrong place.

Current conditions result in neither the muscular and effective student activism favored by the defenders of current campus politics nor the emboldened, challenging professors that critics prefer. Instead, both sides seem to be gradually marginalized in favor of the growing managerial class that dominates so many campuses. Yes, students get to dictate increasingly elaborate and punitive speech codes that some of them prefer. But what could be more corporate or bureaucratic than the increasingly tight control on language and culture in the workplace? Those efforts both divert attention from the material politics that the administration often strenuously opposes (like divestment campaigns) and contribute to a deepening cultural disrespect for student activism. Professors, meanwhile, cling for dear life, trying merely to preserve whatever tenure track they can, prevented by academic culture, a lack of coordination and interdepartmental resentments from rallying together as labor activists. That the contemporary campus quiets the voices of both students and teachers — the two indispensable actors in the educational exchange — speaks to the funhouse-mirror quality of today’s academy.

I wish that committed student activists would recognize that the administrators who run their universities, no matter how convenient a recipient of their appeals, are not their friends. I want these bright, passionate students to remember that the best legacy of student activism lies in shaking up administrators, not in making appeals to them. At its worst, this tendency results in something like collusion between activists and administrators.

As a result, our campuses are becoming simultaneously too safe and too dangerous, with every safe academic space balanced by a space of socially desirable danger out of activists’ reach. Our students emerge from classrooms that, we complain, have been sanitized to the point of ridiculousness, and then spend their evenings in Greek houses and dorms that are in a state of perpetual alcoholic fugue. (And let us not be so naïve as to doubt that universities quietly cultivate their reputations as party havens, knowing how essential such a reputation can be to attracting potential students.) At Purdue, I watched what I said as an instructor, for fear of having to show up to answer a complaint in some dean’s office, but I couldn’t ride my bicycle past the fraternity houses on Slayter Hill on a Saturday afternoon without being accosted with homophobic slurs. That’s the future I fear the most: that the educational function of the university will become sanitized and smoothed over, while the spaces that have always resisted fair treatment of difference will continue to do so. It is as if the left is grasping more tightly the few spaces it can control — classrooms, publishing, academic conferences — out of frustration toward all the places it cannot.

Having spent a life in the academy, I now find myself in the increasingly common position of having one foot out and one foot in. I have finished my Ph.D., and I have no long-term job. I am an instructor but not a professor; I am on campus but not of it, an itinerant visitor. In this standing I join countless thousands of others whose contracts don’t extend past the next semester. Meanwhile, a new generation of students has become acclimated to the experience of college as luxury resort hotel, one they will pay for in student loans for the rest of their lives. Every day, there are fewer who remember what campus once was, or would want to fight for it. The colleges themselves, motivated by only the desire to please their alumni and their boards by advancing in the relentless competition up the rankings, cannot conceive of a world beyond the viewbook.

But perhaps something wild can be preserved, or revived, at the contemporary American university. If so, students will have to be the ones who lead the way, not by making appeals to institutions that will never truly serve their needs but by creating a new, human — as opposed to corporate — campus politics. Until then, we will have to wander, looking for those remaining places that are still untamed, still a little wild.",REAL
Teaching Martin Luther King Jr. in the Age of Freddie Gray,"Photo

In 1968, when my father was a teenage boy in Memphis, Martin Luther King Jr. went there to support the city’s striking sanitation workers. He marched with King and thousands of other protesters, and in the violence that erupted afterward, the police shot another black boy, Larry Payne. They claimed he was a looter. King called Payne’s mother to console her, but a planned visit never happened. King was murdered just a few days later.

When I was a young girl, my father transcribed from memory some of King’s great speeches and asked me to memorize them myself. Later, he bought old records with recordings of the speeches — ‘‘The Drum Major Instinct,’’ ‘‘I’ve Been to the Mountaintop’’ — and when I wasn’t too busy being a child, he would make me listen to them, again and again. By the time I was in high school, writing essays about the civil rights movement came easily. I had a vernacular and a mode of analysis, and also a discipline. I had learned by repetition how to question authority.

Now I am a teacher, seeking a similar discipline in my students. Early on a Wednesday in April, I found myself standing before my English-composition class at New York’s Borough of Manhattan Community College. My students are earnest, hard-working, even brilliant, but many of them face significant challenges. They are first- or second-generation Americans or immigrants (from China, Georgia, Ghana, Mexico, Nigeria, Ukraine). They hold down full-time jobs. Some of them are raising their own kids.

We were reading King’s ‘‘Letter From Birmingham Jail.’’ They groaned about the length, but I ignored them. King’s craft, I told them, is demonstrated in how he argues so persuasively for positions that seem at first to be in opposition, and to multiple audiences — not simply ‘‘My Dear Fellow Clergymen’’ but the public at large, which in 1963 may have supported desegregation but also recoiled from the spectacle of protest, with its intimation of lawlessness and chaos.

The class was also struggling with an essay that the psychologist Erich Fromm wrote that same year, ‘‘Disobedience as a Psychological and Moral Problem.’’ He argued that ‘‘freedom and the capacity for disobedience are inseparable; hence any social, political and religious system which proclaims freedom, yet stamps out disobedience, cannot speak the truth.’’

We returned to King’s letter, in which he draws a distinction between just and unjust laws. They didn’t know about this King, I found, the one who fought the law. In their view, the civil rights movement was embodied in King the Christlike leader, who stands for peace, love and brotherhood.",REAL
Teaching Working Students,"Photo

Students are generally passive when talking about the law, but Ellie, a sophomore at CUNY’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, leapt into the discussion of the constitutionality of capital punishment in my death-­penalty course. When she eviscerated the Supreme Court ruling upholding Texas’ death penalty law, I knew I had met a special student. On the midterm, she earned the highest grade anyone had ever gotten on the exam. Later, I learned that she had scored 1,480 on her SAT. Ellie wanted to be an attorney; it seemed inevitable that she would end up at an Ivy League law school. She had a prodigious, nimble intellect and, as I saw it, a limitless future.

Ellie also had an 8-year-old son, whom she was raising on her own; an alcoholic, depressive father; and a mountain of debt. She had the strangest college transcript I had ever seen: straight A’s and straight F’s, with the exception of a single B-plus in English, which would have been an A but for the professor’s strict attendance policy that penalized anyone who missed more than three classes. In fact, all of her failing grades came from violations of draconian absence and lateness rules. When her son had a health crisis, she began to miss class more frequently, and she received five F’s.

If Ellie had gone to an elite private college, her absences would have been accommodated. In my seven years as a student and teaching fellow at Harvard, I never knew of anyone who was denied an extension for any reason. But the students I teach are the ones who need flexibility. About half of CUNY’s students work, and half of those students work more than 20 hours a week, as Ellie did. Fifty-­four percent live in a household with an annual income of less than $30,000, as Ellie also did. The underlying problem is that the New York State financial-­aid program on which an overwhelming majority of CUNY students depend doesn’t allow students to attend college part time. It also requires colleges to audit attendance or risk losing financial aid. So colleges like mine that rely on government support create a vicious conundrum: an affordable pathway to a first-rate education, but one fraught with ironclad rules ill suited for the kinds of lives that students like Ellie lead.

Even when Ellie’s life settled down, rehabilitating her record seemed too daunting, and she never returned to college. She became one of roughly 50 percent of entering CUNY students who fail to graduate within six years — around the national public-­college average. Ellie, who still hopes to return to college, is a paralegal today, and no doubt the best one at her law firm. But it’s a shame that the system couldn’t help her become the superstar attorney she was meant to be.",REAL
Teaching a Different Shakespeare From the One I Love,"The imaginary pleasure of that line of descent survived even when I discovered, in my years of studying and living in England, that the English themselves could not or would not acknowledge the claim made by someone of my name, background or religion. It did not matter: I had only to open the book and read in order to enter the kingdom.

All of this has, like an insubstantial pageant faded, dissolved and left not a trace behind. It is not that the English language has ceased to be a precious possession; on the contrary, it is far more important now than it ever was in my childhood. But its importance has little or nothing to do any longer with the dream of rootedness. English is the premier international language, the global medium of communication and exchange. In the cafes of Cambridge, Mass., on the Tube in London and at scientific colloquia in São Paulo, Berlin or Kyoto, speakers from worlds apart drop their native tongues and make their way, as best they can, in whatever English they can muster.

Shakespeare has not lost his place in this new world, just as, despite the grim jeremiads of the cultural pessimists, he has not lost his place in colleges and universities. On the contrary, his works (and even his image) turn up everywhere, and students continue to flock to courses that teach him, even when those courses are not required.

But as I have discovered in my teaching, it is a different Shakespeare from the one with whom I first fell in love. Many of my students may have less verbal acuity than in years past, but they often possess highly developed visual, musical and performative skills. They intuitively grasp, in a way I came to understand only slowly, the pervasiveness of songs in Shakespeare’s plays, the strange ways that his scenes flow one into another or the cunning alternation of close-ups and long views. When I ask them to write a 10-page paper analyzing a particular web of metaphors, exploring a complex theme or amassing evidence to support an argument, the results are often wooden; when I ask them to analyze a film clip, perform a scene or make a video, I stand a better chance of receiving something extraordinary. A student with a beautiful voice performed Brahms’s Ophelia songs, with a piano accompaniment by another gifted musician. Students with a knack for creative writing have composed monologues in the voice of the villainous Iago, short stories depicting an awkward reunion of Shylock and his daughter, Jessica, or even additional scenes in Shakespearean verse.

This does not mean that I should abandon the paper assignment; it is an important form of training for a range of very different challenges that lie in their future. But I see that their deep imaginative engagement with Shakespeare, their intoxication, lies elsewhere. And I should add that no one, as far as I can tell, any longer dreams of establishing symbolic descent from Stratford-upon-Avon to substitute for or displace actual descent from Vilnius or Seoul or Johannesburg. Contrary to my expectations, my students at Harvard are far more diverse, in geographical origin, culture and class, than my students ever were at U.C. Berkeley. They embrace this diversity and confidently expect to make their way through a global environment linked by complex digital networks.

Shakespeare has already mastered this environment, as he once mastered the comparatively tiny world of the Elizabethan theater. At Internet Shakespeare Editions, a website that originated at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, readers can access old-spelling editions of all the plays and poems, along with a vast, ongoing ‘‘Performance Chronicle’’ and other resources. The M.I.T. Global Shakespeare Project features an electronic archive that includes images of every page of the First Folio of 1623. In the Norton Shakespeare, which I edit, the texts of his plays are now available not only in the massive printed book with which I was initiated but also on a digital platform. One click and you can hear each song as it might have sounded on the Elizabethan stage; another click and you listen to key scenes read by a troupe of professional actors. It is a kind of magic unimagined even a few years ago or rather imaginable only as the book of a wizard like Prospero in ‘‘The Tempest.’’

But it is not the new technology alone that attracts students to Shakespeare; it is still more his presence throughout the world as the common currency of humanity. In Taiwan, Tokyo and Nanjing, in a verdant corner of the Villa Borghese gardens in Rome and in an ancient garden in Kabul, in Berlin and Bangkok and Bangalore, his plays continue to find new and unexpected ways to enchant.

The old desire that was awakened in me has renewed itself, for different reasons but with equal or greater force. In Tehran last November, I spoke for hours with ardent, well-informed and eloquent students eager to grapple with ‘‘Richard III’’ and ‘‘Macbeth.’’ In Abu Dhabi I watched a highly inventive — deliberately fragmented and deconstructed — student adaptation of ‘‘Hamlet,’’ and I learned of comparably imaginative performances in Oman and Mysore, Karachi and Sana. If Shakespeare himself would not have understood the languages or even fully recognized what had happened to his stories, he would, I think, have nonetheless embraced with delight the whole astonishing diffusion of his influence. After all, he called his theater the Globe.",REAL
Teaching Slavery to Reluctant Listeners,"Photo

One thing is certain as I prepare to teach another course on U.S. history. Invariably, at least one student evaluation will complain that ‘‘Professor Baptist only talks about slavery.’’ It’s an annual reminder that while I’ve been trying to teach the history of slavery for two decades in American classrooms, America has tried to evade thinking about that history for far longer. Twenty-­four decades have passed since the Continental Congress deleted Thomas Jefferson’s criticisms of slavery from his first draft of the Declaration of Independence, and college students today arrive knowing little about the way America’s history of slavery has shaped their lives. Avoidance of the topic is deeply ingrained.

When I was at the University of Pennsylvania in the ’90s, the campus environment felt as if a bubbling bowl of white resentment were spilling over mostly black West Philadelphia. This was the era in which public intellectuals seriously discussed ‘‘The Bell Curve,’’ which argued that I.Q. tests proved African-­Americans were intellectually inferior. This kind of questioning — directly inherited from the history of white defenses of slavery — found its way into the Civil War history discussion I was leading. Two young white students complained that criticizing enslavers was modern-­day moralizing. Slaves, they said, might have actually been happy. They kept glancing at T., the class’s lone black student. I naïvely thought that if I invited T. to speak up, he would find a way to shut the white students down. ‘‘T., do you want to respond?’’ I asked. As soon as the words left my mouth, I realized my mistake. T.’s face stiffened. ‘‘It’s not right to always look at one group of people to explain slavery,’’ he said firmly. T. didn’t speak again for the rest of the semester. Powerful forces were giving certain students the message that to protect their inherited privileges, they needed to dig in and resist confronting the facts of American history that had led to, for instance, a class in which there was only one black student.

When I began teaching at the University of Miami in 1998, however, I found that the student population had already reached the demographic tipping point that the Census Bureau says the entire country won’t reach until 2050. White ‘‘Anglos’’ were a minority. But I didn’t fully experience the effects of a ­minority-­white classroom until the day a class pushed its white members to take on the burden of explaining slavery. The course was pre-­1865 American history — before emancipation, in other words. Several white students were complaining that I expected too much from their weekly essays. Though members of the school’s honors program, they insisted that the class was too challenging and grumbled that too many assignments focused on slavery.

Finally, one young woman had heard enough. Born in Jamaica, S. lived in a working-­class neighborhood in Broward County. She was unquestionably the best writer in the class. S. turned around in her seat and pinned the complainers with a glare. ‘‘Stop whining and do the work — that’s why you’re here.’’ The power dynamics of the class instantly shifted. Then something interesting happened: The white students responded. Over the weeks to come, not only did they work harder, but their comments became less defensive, more insightful. S. had challenged the white students to cast aside their expectation that the class would focus on their felt needs — including their reluctance to wrestle with present legacies of past wrongs. I learned that if you want to have conversations that transcend intractable arguments about race, you can’t reproduce the historical structures of power that created those problems in the first place.

When I moved to Cornell a few years later, the classroom became much whiter. Resentment of the topic of slavery hums at a relatively low volume in Ithaca’s chilly upstate classrooms. Eyes roll with less adolescent abandon than at Penn in the 1990s. Still, students occasionally try to derail the issue in ways that show their discomfort; one white woman’s sole contribution to the discussion last year was to ask with a smirk whether Africans sold other Africans to European dealers.

So as I walk into the first class of the semester, I know that I will find challenge, discomfort and even anxiety. Whenever we dredge up the past, we find that the rusty old chains we rake from the bottom are connected to some people’s present-­day pains and others’ contemporary privilege. But to do that kind of work, as S. insisted, is why we are here.",REAL
The Misanthropic Genius of Joy Williams,"The typical Williams protagonist is a wayward girl or young woman whose bad decisions, or bad attitude, or both, make her difficult to admire: She drives away while her husband is paying for gas, or ransacks a houseguest’s room to read her journal. In Williams’s precise, unsparing, surprising prose, her characters reach for the sublime but often fall miserably to earth: ‘‘Sam and Elizabeth met as people usually meet. Suddenly, there was a deceptive light in the darkness. A light that blackly reminded the lonely of the darkness.’’ She has a gift for sentences whose unsettling turns — ‘‘While she was thinking of something perfectly balanced and amusing to say, the baby was born’’ — force readers to grapple, just as her characters grapple, with the way life will do what it wants with you. Other writers I spoke to about Williams’s work expressed a sense of awe at the grandeur underlying her stories of weirdos and misfits. ‘‘She’s a visionary,’’ Karen Russell told me, ‘‘and she resizes people against a cosmic backdrop.’’

This month, Knopf will publish ‘‘The Visiting Privilege,’’ a collection of 46 stories that cements Williams’s position not merely as one of the great writers of her generation, but as our pre-eminent bard of humanity’s insignificance. The collection’s epigraph is a verse from 1 Corinthians: ‘‘We shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.’’ When Don DeLillo called to talk about Williams, he quoted that verse back to me. Then he said: ‘‘This is the definition of the classic American short story. And this is what Joy writes so beautifully.’’

Joy Williams likes a good road trip, so let’s take one through a Joy Williams story. The road is familiar — you recognize the religious undertones; the dark humor; the animals flapping overhead and squashed on the pavement. You smile at Williams’s disarming manner of juxtaposing words, pressing unsettling meanings out of them: ‘‘The two women sat in the living room surrounded by wooden ducks. The ducks, exquisite and oppressive, nested on every surface.’’ You think you know the route you’re taking, but after a few detours and hairpin turns you may have lost track of how you’re ever supposed to get to where you’re meant to go. The ride might end with the squeal of brakes and shattering of glass. It might also be beautiful:

The car flipped over twice, miraculously righted itself and skidded back onto the road, the roof and fenders crushed. ... None of them were injured and at first they denied that anything unusual had happened at all. May said, ‘‘I thought it was just a dream, so I kept on going.’’

And the exclamation points! When they appear, they hit like hammers. They suggest a kind of wonder at how she, and we, ever could have ended up in all these strange places. (‘‘Daddy was smoking and drinking more and surrendering himself to bleak pronouncements. He was sometimes gruff with them as though they were not everything to him!’’) Ann Beattie said of the punctuation mark: ‘‘Other writers use them too much and injudiciously. Joy uses them judiciously, often because a character is uneasy about the disconnect between the text and the subtext. It’s like laughing nervously as you say something.’’

Williams talks like a Joy Williams character; in our time together, she was extremely reticent, yet on several occasions she burst out with a revelation so breathtakingly personal that I, too, laughed nervously. The rhythms of our conversation — chitchat punctuated by silence interrupted by exclamations of despair and rage — were like none I’d ever had before. Once, to my horror, I found myself asking her how she’d like to die. She replied instantly: ‘‘A car crash! It’s quick.’’

Williams met her first husband, Fred McCormack, while she was attending the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. They moved to Florida, where he worked as a reporter, and they had a daughter, Caitlin. Williams wrote in a trailer outside Tallahassee where they lived for a time and that she would portray in her story ‘‘Woods’’: ‘‘The place smelled of cigarettes and mice that wouldn’t be trapped. The paneled walls bent to the touch.’’ She would later recall that living situation as ‘‘excellent, practically morbid conditions for the writing of a first novel.’’

By the time that novel, ‘‘State of Grace,’’ was nominated for a National Book Award in 1974, Williams had divorced McCormack and married L. Rust Hills, the longtime fiction editor at Esquire; he soon adopted her daughter. Even as she settled into a 30-plus-year marriage, Williams wrote fiction that viewed love with a gimlet eye; her characters find love with the wrong people, worry when they’re away, are casually cruel when they return. They yearn for passion, yet don’t know what to do with it. The young woman adrift at the center of ‘‘The Lover’’ (1974), mid-affair, ‘‘wants to be in love,’’ Williams writes. ‘‘Her face is thin with the thinness of a failed lover. It is so difficult!’’

In that same story, the young woman drops her daughter off at nursery school to go sailing with her lover and, when she returns, has trouble recognizing her child: ‘‘There are so many children, after all, standing in the rooms, all the same size, all small, quizzical creatures.’’ Williams is close to her grown daughter and grandson, and spoke of her daughter’s easygoing childhood near the beach in Florida. But an ambivalence about parenting percolates through her work. She seems, in the tension between parents and their offspring, to take the side of the children; she has a keen sense of their desires and the small crimes they will commit to achieve them. ‘‘All children fib a little,’’ she writes in her story ‘‘The Excursion.’’ ‘‘Their lives are incompatible with the limits imposed upon their experience.’’

Williams and Hills eventually settled in Key West. Far from the New York literary scene, they cultivated their own community of writers and threw parties at their house on Pine Street. Even within this more social milieu, Williams recalled, she often sneaked away early and went to bed. Her boozy and mysterious second novel, ‘‘The Changeling’’ (1978), takes up the interplay between interior lives and the natural world: On a tiny island off the Atlantic coast, people rut in the grass like animals, neigh like horses, bite and scratch. In one memorable scene, a girl transforms for just an instant into a deer, her flanks ‘‘covered with tight, bright fur.’’

The novel was — as Dwight Garner, a New York Times book critic, later put it — ‘‘burned and then buried alive’’ by Anatole Broyard in The Times. ‘‘He jumped publication date!’’ Williams said indignantly of Broyard. ‘‘He couldn’t wait to screw me.’’ Williams, stung by the review, didn’t publish her third novel, ‘‘Breaking and Entering,’’ until 1988; the restless tale of a pair of wanderers who break into vacation houses while their owners are up north, it reads now like an X-ray of its era — anomic, ominous. The Florida beach exists to be seen through bay windows by the foolish snowbirds who live behind them.

With the 2000 novel ‘‘The Quick and the Dead,’’ Williams’s work took a sharp turn into a new landscape: Arizona, where she and Hills had bought a house. Williams flings her characters — ghosts and teenagers and seekers — across the desert with a kind of narratorial rage. And the characters give as few damns what people think of them as their creator does. In ‘‘The Quick and the Dead,’’ Williams’s sense of place came from the earth, the air, the plants and animals, the killing heat — and the inconsequence of human endeavor within that world. The stories she was writing around that time similarly revel in the way the desert places each character on a knife’s edge; in ‘‘Charity,’’ a single snake crossing the New Mexico highway sends a car smashing ‘‘with a snapping of axles’’ into a pocket of ‘‘sacred da­tura, a plant of which every part was poisonous.’’ The accident happens because a boy grabs the steering wheel, trying to run the snake over. Even in the frightening chaos of the crash’s aftermath, Williams finds comedy: ‘‘I just wanted that snake so bad,’’ the boy moans.

Nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, ‘‘The Quick and the Dead’’ reflected Williams’s new environmental fervor, which was stirred in 1997 while she was reporting for Harper’s about the animal rights movement. Her feature, ‘‘The Inhumanity of the Animal People,’’ was republished in a bracing 2001 collection, ‘‘Ill Nature.’’ While her use of the natural world in her fiction is evocative and harshly beautiful, these essays were jeremiads — blunt and furious and uninterested in being even a bit reasonable. ‘‘You have made only brutal contact with Nature,’’ she says. ‘‘You cannot comprehend its grace.’’

‘‘Why be polite about this?’’ she asked me, late one night. ‘‘Why be reasonable?’’ Her sunglasses glinted in the lamplight. ‘‘Nothing is going to change until they kill every last wild animal on this planet.’’

The afternoon before our hike, I met Williams in a courtyard at the Arizona Inn, a setting the extremely private writer chose precisely to avoid introducing me to her dogs, tortoise, house or car. The hotel is elegant but fusty, the kind of place that offers free ice cream by the pool every night. I asked her how she actually, you know, made money. (The only one of her books that ever sold well is a Florida Keys tourism guide she wrote in the 1980s, which is both gloriously written and perfectly scornful of tourism.) ‘‘What a question!’’ She laughed raucously, but she considered it, sipping a glass of white wine. ‘‘It doesn’t add up,’’ she allowed. ‘‘I don’t know! I don’t know how I’ve lived.’’

Williams does not have an email address. She uses a flip phone and often writes in motels and friends’ houses on old Smith-Coronas; she brings one with her and keeps others everywhere she stays. Hills died in 2008, and Williams now splits her time among Tucson, her daughter’s home in Maine and Laramie, migrating across the country with her dogs in her Toyota, which has 160,000 miles on it but is pretty new by her standards. (Her last car, her old Bronco, neared 360,000.) She eats a lot of Weetabix.

These days, Williams spends much of her time alone but for her dogs, Noche and Aslan — German shepherds, a breed she’s had all her life. She talks avidly about their personalities and dislikes and fears. In 1997, she was mauled by one of her shepherds, a 9-year-old male named Hawk; the incident is the subject of a hair-raising, heartbreaking essay in ‘‘Ill Nature,’’ which is mostly about Williams’s misery at having to put the dog down after the attack. The essay ends with her dream of walking with Hawk, ‘‘my handsome boy, my good boy, my love,’’ together among the dead.

The sky above the Arizona Inn was fading orange, and a bird of prey was swooping over our heads. I thought of the scene in ‘‘The Changeling,’’ the girl transfiguring into a deer. Williams seems to be searching for nothing less than a kind of artistic transfiguration, one in which humanity’s role in fiction is lessened decidedly. ‘‘Short stories need to touch people on a deeper level, a deeper, stranger level,’’ she told me that night, ‘‘and they don’t.’’ When I asked Williams what she wants out of a great story, she replied, ‘‘I want to be devastated in some way.’’ You can draw a line from her work to young writers exploring the same sun-deranged parts of America — Karen Russell, Justin Taylor, Claire Vaye Watkins — but few writers even try to write as wildly as she does. Though Williams has commented positively about some contemporary writers, she is frustrated with the state of the modern short story — including, it seems, her own.

‘‘Most of these stories aren’t getting close to what I’m trying to accomplish,’’ she said of ‘‘The Visiting Privilege.’’ A new novel she has been working on for a decade is, she hopes, a next step — a step away from the ‘‘language and the flash and the burn’’ of today’s literary writing. About that novel, she would only tell me that it’s set in the desert and includes animals of ‘‘species unknown, species never seen.’’

At the end of the evening, she pressed an essay upon me, one that she hadn’t yet published but that she thought would help me understand where she was coming from. It was 17 pages long, typed, hand-corrected, one section Scotch-taped in. ‘‘Give it back to me tomorrow,’’ she said. I was too drunk and tired to read it that night, and got a befuddled clerk at the Arizona Inn to scan it for me.

A few days after I returned home from Tucson, a letter from Williams — a response to written questions I’d given her — arrived in the mail. The envelope had been filched from a writing resi­dency, with a Provincetown return address scribbled out and ‘‘Williams’’ typed underneath it. Inside she had answered a number of my questions, and many I did not ask. She wrote, ‘‘I believe that God is (and must be) a transcendent presence in any worthy work of art.’’ She wrote that she was grateful that Rust had taken her ‘‘into a world of writers and books and sociability I never would have known.’’ She wrote, ‘‘If you had wiped us out in Arizona traffic my last thought would have been — serves me right for agreeing to this profile.’’

The same day the letter arrived, I turned on my laptop and opened the pages Williams had given me to read overnight in Tucson. The essay begins as a lament for contemporary language’s inability to cope with the grandeur and tragedy of the natural world. But soon its scope expands to sound the alarm for literature itself, doggedly focused, as Saul Bellow wrote, on ‘‘the human family as it is.’’ ‘‘Could this obsessional looking at the human bring about the death of literature?’’ Williams asks. In the end the essay is a call to arms for a new kind of literature, one Williams sounds doubtful that anyone, including she, can write.

In her letter, Williams referred to her novel, the one she hopes might represent a new way of writing about the earth. ‘‘I started it a few years before R died,’’ she wrote. ‘‘I have to think it can be saved.’’ I had a vision of her then, deep in the Santa Catalinas, her two beloved dogs by her side, the water bottle filled with martinis, as she typed on one of those old Smith-Coronas. Maybe she would find a cave instead of a motel! I hope that when I finally open this impossible novel that speaks the language of this glorious earth, whose implacable beauty will persist long after we are gone — I hope I cannot understand a word.

‘‘Was it only a dream that Literature was once dangerous, that it had the power to awaken and change us?’’ Williams writes in that unpublished essay. ‘‘Surely it must be, become, dangerous now. ... Behold the mystery, the mysterious, undeserved beauty of the world.’’ Even on my scanned copy I could see that she’d underlined the word behold with a jagged single line of pencil.",REAL
Between Iraq and a Hawk Base,"Fontaine, who is 40, Clark Kentish in appearance and wryly self-deprecating in conversation, has been doing quite a bit of thinking on the matter of Iraq. He worked in the State Department as well as the National Security Council during the first year of the Iraq war before signing on as McCain’s foreign-policy aide in 2004. Over the next five years, he and McCain traveled to Iraq 10 times. His boss had been one of the loudest advocates of toppling Saddam Hussein and then one of the most candidly chagrined observers when the war effort began to crumble before his eyes. ‘‘We’d been running this experiment from 2003 to the end of 2006 of trying to make political changes in Iraq and hoping this would positively influence the security,’’ Fontaine recalled. ‘‘It only got worse and worse. Things got to the point where there was no political or economic activity in the country, because the violence was so bad.’’

The troop surge in 2007 succeeded in stabilizing the country. By then, however, Americans were weary of military aggression. In 2008, they elected president a one-term U.S. senator who had consistently opposed the war in Iraq and vowed to end it so he could devote most of his attention to a foundering economy. Four years later, the electorate awarded Obama a second term, with the same priorities in mind. Exit polls showed that 60 percent of voters regarded the economy as the predominant issue in 2012, while a mere 4 percent cited foreign affairs as their chief voting issue.

Three years later, this has changed — especially for Republican voters, who, according to several polls, now say national security rivals the economy as a foremost concern. Several factors explain this. While the economy has continued to improve, the Obama administration has watched with seeming helplessness as ISIS dominates swaths of Iraq and Syria while beheading American hostages; as Iran threatens to make good on its nuclear ambitions unless the United States agrees to lift sanctions; as Vladimir Putin reasserts Russian primacy by invading the Crimean Peninsula; and as China spreads its influence across Asia and Africa. These and other developments have revived concerns that the United States has become dangerously weaker under a Democratic president, one whose first secretary of state happens to be the apparent favorite for that party’s presidential nomination.

The swaggering rhetoric of Donald Trump, the current Republican front-runner, seems deftly calibrated to reflect the mood of a G.O.P. base spoiling for fights abroad. According to a Quinnipiac University poll in July, 72 percent of registered Iowa Republican voters (where the first contest for presidential delegates will be held early next year) favor sending American ground troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS. In August, Quinnipiac found that 86 percent of all Republicans opposed the Iran nuclear deal.

Fontaine is among the conservative foreign-policy thinkers who argue that the Obama administration has overlearned Iraq’s lessons. ‘‘Their core belief was ‘We’re here to wind these wars down, and the risks in doing so are manageable,’ ’’ he said. ‘‘The instinct was to limit our investment, whether diplomatically or in terms of blood and treasure. That’s caused a willful disregard for the realities at hand. You hear it all the time: ‘This is the Iraqis’ fight,’ or ‘The Syrians should be fighting.’ Yes, they should. But if they’re not, then we have a national interest, and we should be doing something.’’

Eventually, each G.O.P. candidate will be called upon to define exactly what that ‘‘something’’ is and determine whether Americans have an appetite for it. To that end, for the next 14 months, it will fall to advisers like Fontaine to help the candidates craft a post-Bush/post-Obama foreign-policy vision, one that simultaneously projects more muscle than Obama and less reckless use of muscle than Bush. The tricky part, as their advisers — avowed hawks whose careers were shaped by Iraq — know all too well, will be to demonstrate that an aggressive foreign policy can somehow avoid becoming a reckless one.

In the weeks and months following the announcement of a presidential candidacy, the ‘‘invisible primary’’ ensues: a wooing and hoarding of assorted campaign specialists and policy experts to convince the donor community that the candidate in question is for real and lacks only money to make the whole operation hum. During this season, men and women who have lived lives of bookish reserve and who are thoroughly unknown to the general public become, for a brief time, objects of considerable desire.

As a national-security expert who worked with politicians but had no political agenda of his own, Fontaine received multiple inquiries. He declined to work with the campaigns of Scott Walker and Marco Rubio but agreed to join the Bush foreign-policy team after Bill Simon, a former Wal-Mart chief executive and now the Bush campaign’s policy-team recruiter, asked him to come aboard as an informal outside adviser. Simon had heard about Fontaine through other recruits, including the former World Bank president Robert Zoellick, who had been a consultant for several campaigns before Bush prevailed upon him to pledge his fidelity.

Zoellick and Fontaine belong to a nomadic tribe of worldly Republican technocrats who migrate from academia to government to nonprofit policy centers to the private sector. Nearly all are hawks who abhor not only Obama’s posture of caution but also the old-style, consensus-building internationalism espoused by officials who served in the first Bush administration, like Richard Burt and Lorne Craner, who are now on Rand Paul’s foreign-policy team. Among the conservative intelligentsia, a few — Meghan O’Sullivan, Kristen Silverberg and Elbridge Colby — are comparatively moderate alumni of the second Bush administration who now advise his brother’s campaign. Others have made their names on the Hill as forceful interventionists: Robert S. Karem, who advised the House majority leaders Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy before directing Jeb Bush’s foreign-policy team; Jamie Fly, formerly Rubio’s aide in the Senate and now in his campaign; and Michael Gallagher, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff member who now runs Scott Walker’s foreign-policy shop. In addition, advisers like Vance Serchuk, who was Senator Joe Lieberman’s foreign-policy aide and now works in a geopolitical-strategy unit for the global investment firm KKR, and Christian Brose, the staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee, are not committed to a particular campaign but are routinely called by campaign aides for their thoughts on foreign policy. What most of them have in common is that they are under 45 and have been influenced far more by the fall of the twin towers than by the collapse of the Berlin Wall.

The candidates are pulled toward experience as well, creating an odd dissonance within these teams as they are taking shape. For example, Jeb Bush’s team includes not just a new generation of foreign-policy thinkers but also Paul Wolfowitz, a prominent 71-year-old neoconservative. Wolfowitz’s long career in the national-security arena reached both its peak and its nadir when he served as George W. Bush’s deputy secretary of defense and pushed aggressively for the invasion of Iraq just after 9/11, assuring skeptics that the Iraqis would ‘‘welcome us as liberators’’ and that the indigenous oil revenues would largely finance the country’s reconstruction. In no small measure because of Wolfowitz’s erroneous predictions, the neocon brand came to be ridiculed during the early stages of the Iraq war, only to be vindicated somewhat by the triumph of the 2007 troop surge, which quelled Sunni violence and stabilized the Shia-dominated government.

Throughout that period, not every hawk self-identified as a neocon, including Fontaine, who told me, ‘‘Where I come down on this is I believe in the promotion of human rights and democracy, but there are times when you have to have pragmatic relationships with autocracies.’’ And today there are fewer still who call themselves neocons, the moniker being generally viewed as an epithet. Its basic principles, however — among them, a belief in the aggressive promotion of American values throughout the world, an unapologetic distrust of international institutions and the conviction that a more democratic world is a less belligerent one — are abiding specters in conservative foreign-policy thought.

The persistence of a chesty, exceptionalist view of America’s place on the world stage is, of course, also abetted by today’s nuance-free zone of political dialogue. ‘‘The discourse in Washington just becomes like a self-licking ice cream cone of maximalist foreign policy,’’ Obama’s deputy national-security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told me. ‘‘That’s what gets you on television. That’s what gets your think-tank paper read.’’

But conservative voters far from the Beltway are also clamoring for a return to a more muscular foreign policy, and there is almost certainly one major reason for this: It would be very different from the current foreign policy. Obama’s worldview, seven years into his presidency, is aptly reflected by something else that Rhodes said to me: ‘‘There’s such an extreme vanity that everything happening in the world is an extension of our agency. There are just forces happening. They’re happening all across the Middle East. And our narrative of what’s supposed to happen in these places has never been right, because they’re at different stages of development and have different politics. And where we succeed in foreign policy is when we patiently and methodically incentivize better behavior, and you give space for that to occur. It’s very hard to completely impose a system on a country. The last time it worked was in postwar Japan.’’

When I shared Rhodes’s sentiment with Jim Talent, one of Scott Walker’s foreign-policy advisers, he winced before replying: ‘‘Obama doesn’t accept as a basic principle that we should lead in the forefront of events, particularly in the Middle East. I’m not sure the president believes the U.S. can do that. And there I disagree. We can’t control the world. No way. But we do have influence. If you want to call me a neocon for that, go ahead.’’

Talent, a placid-faced 58-year-old Midwesterner, was a congressman from St. Louis when he won a special election to the U.S. Senate in 2002 with heavy backing from President Bush, whose desire for congressional authorization to invade Iraq Talent heartily endorsed. By 2006, when Talent was up for re-election, the war had taken a disastrous turn. Talent nonetheless insisted that ‘‘the mission is going well’’ and further declared that the invasion was justified even when no weapons of mass destruction were found. He lost to Claire McCaskill and has been out of electoral politics ever since.

A second career soon awaited him — that of national-security guru. While serving on congressionally established advisory commissions, Talent also became a national-security adviser to Mitt Romney’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. It was commonly speculated that a President Romney would tap Talent to be his secretary of defense. Today the same can be said for Talent under a Walker presidency.

If Bush, the candidate being advised by Richard Fontaine, is challenged by the need to distinguish his foreign-policy vision from that of his brother, Talent’s candidate — a Wisconsin governor with no experience on international issues — is obligated to come up with a vision from scratch. Talent asserts that Walker, the man who dismantled Wisconsin’s public-employee unions, will face down enemies abroad with equal fortitude. On Aug. 28 at the Citadel, Walker laid out his own foreign-policy approach, emphasizing the need for strong executive leadership, much as Rubio’s foreign-policy address in May made the case that America must ‘‘lead with strength and principle,’’ and Jeb Bush’s speech in August cited America’s need to ‘‘lead again’’ in the Middle East — all of them stopping short of Lindsey Graham’s pledge to send 10,000 troops to Iraq.

To assist in constructing Walker’s foreign policy, Talent says that he is urging the candidate to articulate what he also ‘‘hammered on Mitt’’ to put forward: an encompassing vision with strategic clarity that the public, Congress, allies and enemies can all understand. ‘‘The real lesson of Iraq,’’ he said, ‘‘is that you always have to ask, ‘O.K., what are we trying to achieve and how does it fit into our broader goals?’ ’’ He continued, ‘‘We can’t spend the next term with everybody pointing fingers about what went wrong with Iraq.’’

Arguably, however, ‘‘what went wrong with Iraq’’ was that there was a strategically clear vision in play. It was called the Bush Doctrine, a post-9/11 articulation of neoconservatism. Among its central tenets, as enunciated frequently by Bush himself, was the determination to ‘‘take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us again here at home.’’ Walker has employed nearly identical rhetoric in describing how he would fight ISIS: ‘‘We need a leader who will look the American people in the eye and say, ‘We will do whatever it takes — whatever it takes — to make sure that radical Islamist terrorism does not wash up on American soil.’ I’d rather take the fight to them.’’

I asked Michael Gallagher, the coordinator of Walker’s foreign-policy team, what distinguished his own philosophy from that of the neoconservatives. He replied that such distinctions weren’t meaningful, given that all Republicans favored a robust alternative to Obama’s seeming reluctance to lead: ‘‘I think lost in this debate between isolationism and neoconservatism is the fact that there is a striking amount of consensus within the party.’’ When I asked if there was anything in his experience — Gallagher was a Marine captain deployed to Anbar Province in late 2007 — that would make him question the neoconservative worldview, he paused at great length before finally saying, ‘‘I don’t have anything to offer on that.’’

Republicans like Walker have criticized Obama’s incursion into Libya on the front end (‘‘leading from behind’’) as well as the back end (failing to prevent the free-for-all of warring militias that currently prevails there). But they have been far more reticent in explaining how they would have responded to the popular uprising against Qaddafi or to the Arab Spring in general. When I asked Talent, he thought for a moment before replying. ‘‘Well, I’ll tell you as Jim Talent — I don’t think Governor Walker has opined on this topic yet,’’ he said. ‘‘The question of when purely humanitarian goals, assuming there is such a thing, should be an object of American policy is one that I think reasonable people can really debate over.’’

Prodded to specify what he would have advised the president to do in Libya, Talent mentioned ‘‘two reasonable options.’’ One would have been to limit American activity to humanitarian aid, on the grounds that the circumstances did not significantly affect our national interests. The other recourse would have been to drive Qaddafi out of power but then ‘‘continue to be involved post-conflict, to help ensure that the government that emerges is a partner.’’ In Talent’s view, ‘‘Either of those options would have been better than overthrowing him and seeing what happens next. Now we have a much worse humanitarian disaster and elements on the ground that are enemies of America.’’ Of course, as Talent conceded, he did not warn against such scenarios in real time, before the Libya bombing, just as many Republicans did not forecast the complications that would arise from invading Iraq in 2003.

In May, Walker offered a textbook case of how a Republican presidential candidate can reframe the failures of the Iraq war: Skip past the first four years of chaotic bloodshed and focus instead on President Bush’s decision in 2007 to send another 20,000 troops into Iraq. Bush, Walker said, deserved ‘‘enormous credit for ordering the surge, a courageous move that worked,’’ and then lamented that Obama ‘‘threw away the gains of the surge,’’ with brutal consequences. And in his foreign-policy address last month, Jeb Bush also glossed over the questionable decision to invade Iraq and instead lavished praise on the surge as the ‘‘turning point we had all been waiting for,’’ one that was then squandered by Obama with a ‘‘premature withdrawal’’ of troops that constituted ‘‘the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill, and that Iran has exploited to the full as well.’’

The only Republican candidate who has expressed disagreement with this point of view is Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Regarding the surge, Paul has offered measured praise: ‘‘It was a military tactic and it worked.’’ But he has flatly stated that ‘‘invading Iraq was a mistake.’’ Paul’s blunt assessment of the Iraq war has won him some peculiar bedfellows — among them, Elise Jordan, who served in Bush’s National Security Council’s communications team in Washington and Afghanistan and also traveled to Iraq while serving as a speechwriter for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. She is now on the foreign-policy team of Paul, the least interventionist candidate in the Republican field. Jordan, who is 33, has often been asked variations of: ‘‘Wait. You work for Rand Paul? And you were in Iraq?’’ To which her reply has been: ‘‘Yes. Exactly.’’

As a Bush staff member, Jordan watched Iraq degenerate into turmoil — observing at close hand, she said, ‘‘a really clear disconnect between what we were telling ourselves and what was happening on the ground.’’ The surge revived her hopes in America’s ability to quell sectarian violence by military means. But after leaving the White House, she worked as a freelance journalist, visiting Afghanistan in 2010 to embed with U.S. troops for an article about the military’s counterinsurgency efforts against the Taliban. This was during a troop surge modeled after the maneuver in Iraq, but in Afghanistan, the tactic proved ineffectual. Jordan began to question the value of the war there and, more broadly, the neoconservative notion that America can impose its values on other nations. ‘‘While I still believe that all people deserve freedom, it’s paternalistic to think we can bring it to them,’’ she told me.

She met Paul in March 2013 — days after his nearly 13-hour filibuster relating to Obama’s drone program, and three months before her husband, the acclaimed Rolling Stone journalist Michael Hastings, was killed in an automobile accident. Echoing what Paul’s other advisers would tell me, Jordan was struck by how thoughtful and well read he seemed, belying the caricature of him as an isolationist. Since signing on, she has been surprised by the vigor with which the other candidates, particularly Marco Rubio, Rick Perry and Lindsey Graham, have attacked his foreign-­policy views. ‘‘The fact that so many are threatened by him is a sign of how the Republican Party can’t deal with some deviations from conventional thought,’’ she said.

Those attacks have dwindled of late, no doubt because Paul has struggled to raise money, mount a disciplined campaign and break through the primal roar of the Trump movement. Still, it remains the case that Paul is the only candidate committed to designing a post-neocon Republican foreign policy. As another of his advisers, the Carnegie Mellon University international-relations professor Kiron Skinner, says, ‘‘He’s trying to provide a corrective to both the Bush and Obama administrations, in which we use American military power responsibly and when there’s a clear understanding of what’s needed.’’

That feat has been difficult for Paul to pull off as he attempts to placate both the libertarian followers of his father, Ron Paul, and the conservative G.O.P. base. He has hedged on his commitment to eliminate all foreign aid, gone out of his way to show his support for Israel and adopted more confrontational language toward Syria and Iran. Paul has also said that if he were president, he would ‘‘seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily.’’ Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper to clarify what this would entail, he said that he meant ‘‘Arab boots on the ground.’’ The candidate has yet to elaborate on how he would be the first American president to inspire an Arab army to ‘‘destroy’’ an Islamist extremist group.

Of course, presidential campaigns don’t tend to be incubators of complex foreign policy. Throughout the 2008 campaign cycle, Obama the candidate was fond of declaring on the stump that Al Qaeda grew stronger because the Iraq war had caused the Bush administration to ‘‘take our eye off the ball’’ instead of ‘‘refocusing our attention on the war that can be won in Afghanistan.’’ Today the president is at pains to explain why this refocusing has not come close to fulfilling his campaign declarations.

Today’s foreign-policy thinkers must also test their idealistic notions of American possibility on a geo­political landscape littered with the wreckage of ideals past. As Richard Fontaine explained to me: ‘‘In Iraq, we toppled the government and did an occupation and everything went to hell. In Libya, we toppled the government and didn’t do an occupation and everything went to hell. In Syria, we didn’t topple the government and didn’t do an occupation and everything went to hell. So, broadly, this is the Middle East. Things go to hell. And we’ve got to make our way through that fact to protect our national interests, on the back of a war-weary public that doesn’t want to invest our treasure in this.’’

That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America’s leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference’s main event was an hourlong debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national-security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michèle Flournoy, Obama’s former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush’s former Defense Department comptroller and foreign-­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama’s director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were the retired general David Petraeus, the former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and Jeb Bush’s outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.

The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS’s ideology was to ‘‘take territory away from ISIS.’’ And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: ‘‘The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?’’

Zakheim’s realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation’s most intellectually rigorous foreign-­policy thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.

But Fontaine was not won over. ‘‘Their argument — don’t roll them back, hold them in place and they’ll defeat themselves through their internal contradictions — has never happened to a terrorist group,’’ he said later. ‘‘And I think we can roll them back. We’ve already shrunk their territory by a third. Containment, if you stop there, is a recipe for endless bloodshed.’’ That was his distinctly minority, stubbornly hawkish opinion. And if Fontaine had his way, it would soon become Jeb Bush’s as well.",REAL
The Politics of Distraction,"The shiny-­object metaphor is not confined to the realm of politics. Business ­strategy, technology and marketing consultants have all referred to ‘‘bright, shiny objects’’ (or ‘‘B.S.O.s’’) to describe the fickle tastes of modern life. Urban Dictionary identifies ‘‘S.O.S.’’ (‘‘shiny-­object syndrome’’) as ‘‘a condition which causes an inability to focus on any particular person while online dating.’’ (By the same token, a number of commentators have dismissed Trump’s recent success in the polls as ‘‘just a summer fling.’’) Its origin may actually lie with an older sort of stump performer. ‘‘Magicians use sleight of hand, dangling a shiny object in front of their audiences to distract them from the hidden deception going on elsewhere,’’ said Christopher Cerf, a co-­author of ‘‘Spin-glish: The Definitive Dictionary of Deliberately Deceptive Language.’’

To some degree, politics has always involved deception. The advent of television intensified this, shrinking attention spans, creating ways to distort and vilify and dramatizing the existential stakes of prosaic debates. Think Lyndon Johnson’s devastating ‘‘Daisy’’ ad in his 1964 re-­election campaign against Barry Goldwater, which showed a little girl picking petals off a daisy and the sudden explosion of a bright, shiny mushroom cloud.

In 1962, the historian Daniel Boorstin published ‘‘The Image: Or What Happened to the American Dream,’’ in which he identified the dawning of the ‘‘age of contrivance,’’ marked by ‘‘pseudo-­events’’: staged happenings that animate a cultural calendar (Hallmark holidays, anniversaries), as well as political set pieces (photo ops, candidate ‘‘announcement’’ ­speeches). Political pseudo-­events have been the engine of television advertising, which focuses on smaller-­bore matters, or ‘‘wedge issues,’’ that would have little relevance to an actual presidency but nonetheless shine a nasty glare on a candidate. George Bush attacked his Democratic presidential opponent, Michael Dukakis, by asserting that Dukakis’s support of a prison-­furlough program in Massachusetts represented a permissive liberalism that he would take to the White House. (The shiny object here was Willie Horton, the escaped convict featured in an infamous campaign ad.) If television was a major development in the creation of shiny objects, the Internet was an Ursa Major development. Even the most isolated outrages become outsize on our little, attention-burning screens.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama and his campaign team warned against becoming too drawn to the ‘‘shiny objects’’ that preoccupied the press. ‘‘It was basically a not-­subtle way of saying that political reporters had attention-­deficit disorder,’’ said Dan Pfeiffer, a former top adviser to Obama. In our defense, though, the A.D.D. of political reporters is fostered by a warped and warping system. Media bosses demand a constant flow of material, which ensures that much reporting remains undigested. Customers want speed or will click elsewhere; competitors spew their own undigested news, and campaigns are only too happy to concoct it, or their opponents will. Shiny objects become tools of our least resistance. Polls and gaffes take less time and brainpower to comprehend than, say, Jeb Bush’s book on immigration policy.

In other words, the press colludes with politicians in this culture of distraction-­mongering. Meanwhile, a new class of political figures has built careers almost entirely on shiny-object status. It’s more fun than writing policy treatises and much easier than actual governing — and it pays better too.

Sarah Palin belongs on the Mount Rushmore of human shiny objects. She secured her place after John McCain made her his surprise running mate in 2008. In an appearance on CNN back then, the pundit Paul Begala lamented that Democrats seemed ‘‘to just not be able to resist’’ focusing on ‘‘the shiny object of Sarah Palin, who is not running against Barack Obama.’’ Less than a year after the campaign ended, Palin had quit her governor’s job and moved on to a lucrative career as a full-time media troll, pundit, author and rally headliner who has been paid eight figures since 2009. Like Trump, she became a reality-­TV star (on a short-­lived TLC series), which is always good for business in Shiny Object Land.

So is running for president. It’s good to convey a sense of being in play even if you clearly are not. Back in the innocent days of 2010, 2011 and 2012, reporters were always falling over one another to ask Trump whether he would run. NBC’s First Read memo summarized a Trump appearance on ‘‘Face the Nation’’ under the heading of ‘‘Your Sunday-­Show Shiny-­Object Alert: Donald Trump to CBS’s Bob Schieffer on whether or not he will eventually jump into the 2012 contest: ‘I hope I don’t have to. But I may — absolutely.’ ’’ No one really took it seriously.

But sometimes reality TV turns into reality. ‘‘The focus on the shiny object becomes a self-­fulfilling prophecy,’’ Pfeiffer said. ‘‘It turns the shiny object into the actual object.’’ And the Summer of Trump shines on.",REAL
Alton Brown Has Had It With Foodies,"You were on ‘‘Food Network Star’’ for three seasons. What do you think is the difference between wanting to be a chef and wanting to be a Food Network star? As mutually exclusive terms?

They seem pretty different to me. It’s funny. On ‘‘Food Network Star,’’ I got so tired of hearing people tell me that the reason they should have their own show is that they love food so much. Well, so freaking what? I love food. We all love food. If we don’t, we die. Even supermodels in New York secretly love food. That doesn’t make you special. And people who want to be stars often make the mistake of thinking that it does, and that if they can just show you how much they love it, they will somehow become compelling. This is not the case.

Seems as if what they actually love is convincing you that they love food. At best, love is the gasoline. It’s not the car.

You gave a speech in Washington a few years ago, and it was reported that you said that if you’re dumb enough to eat fast food three times a day, you should just die and get out of the way of the rest of us. Well, I don’t remember saying that! I do, however, believe that if you’re going to eat fast food three times a day and then complain about it, there is a problem there. But the price gap between junk food and real food only seems to be widening, so I wouldn’t say that anymore. We have designed our system to force people into nutritional slavery.

You’re a big believer in self-reliance and responsibility. Do you see cooking as a form of self-reliance? I am, and it is. I get that there are people who can only afford to fill their stomachs with bad, cheap food. But I do think that most of us need to actually take responsibility for what we’re putting in our mouths. Obesity is not a disease. Can it be caused by diseases in certain rare cases? Yes, but the second that our society starts thinking that shoveling Big Macs into our face is a disease then we’re done, we’re done as a culture.

You also fly your own plane, and I read that you carry a gun. Is that true? It depends on where I am. But yeah. I have guns. I have an office in a questionable part of town, and I’m often working there rather late at night. I have been accosted before, so I may or may not be armed at certain times.

Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, recently made a video in which he cooked bacon on the barrel of a gun. Would you recommend such a technique? There are so many other cheaper, easier ways to cook bacon.",REAL
Can I Lie to My Father About Being Gay So He Will Pay for My College Education?,"Photo

I am a young gay man in college. My father generously pays for my tuition and rent. The problem is that he does not know I am gay. He has made it very clear that if I were, he would not only withdraw all financial support but also cast himself entirely out of my life. His suspicion arose in high school when he found love letters between me and another male student. I swore they were meaningless and have since been defending my heterosexuality. Questions about my sexuality are inevitable whenever I come home. My father has demanded I produce archives of all emails and text messages for him to review, although I have successfully refused these requests on the grounds that he has no claim to my adult communications. Is it ethical for me to continue accepting financial support for my education and my career that will come from it? Could I continue to lie to accept the support and one day disclose my sexuality and pay him back to absolve myself of any ethical wrongdoing? NAME WITHHELD

Amy Bloom: It’s terrible that it should be so hard to get a college education in this country without accumulating massive debt. But what’s happening here is an issue not just of finances but of a real wish on the part of the father to control and bully his son. The fact that the father demands that the son produce archives of all emails and text messages for him to review? That’s just abuse. That’s not about money, and it may not even necessarily be about his being gay. If there were no questions, you could say nothing about your private life and your sexuality.

Lots of people keep these things from their parents, and you can do that in a completely honorable way. The letter writer can, in his position of dependency, lie to his father and know that although he is not taking the bravest or most admirable stance, his lying is understandable. You can certainly forgive yourself for the lying in this circumstance and maybe be mindful of the fact that this will not last and that you won’t have to keep lying.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: It is important, given the general way in which college education is funded in our society, not to think of the parental support here as a kind of free gift that the parent is entitled to withdraw on any basis. Basically, a responsible parent who has the resources has an obligation to provide his fair share after financial aid and contributions from the kid based on his work and so on.

I don’t think that the parent has a right to threaten to withdraw support for any reason except a failure to be serious about college. If you know that if you tell him the truth, he’ll treat you in a way he ought not to treat you, then that’s a circumstance in which a lie — while it continues to be a bad thing — is permissible, given that the consequence of telling the truth will be that somebody else will behave quite impermissibly toward you.

Not only is this young man entitled to conceal the truth from his father, but he doesn’t owe him a repayment later when he can afford it. Threatening not to do your duty if your son turns out to be gay — which is, after all, something over which he has absolutely no control — is awful in many ways. The fact that he would fail to discharge his obligation to pay his fair share if the son told the truth is a reason not to tell him the truth.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Fanny Packs,"Photo

My maternal grandmother, Helen, was a fashion icon of her own making. The daughter of a master tailor, she became an eager seamstress herself. Once, as a teenager, sneaking into her father’s sewing room to whip together a fancy dress, she was so overcome with enthusiasm that she ran a needle straight through her finger. In later years, she abandoned dresses for velour track suits, which made her look like an early-’80s M.C., except she covered hers with every single item in stock from Michaels Arts & Crafts — floral appliqué, rhinestones, puffy paint, embroidery, ribbons, sequins, confetti, ‘‘Proudest Grandma’’ patches. If she could have decorated her clothes with fresh fruit, I think she would have.

But no outfit was complete until she buckled into her fanny pack. She wore one most days until she died about a decade ago. I remember sifting through her belongings and finding her red one, which had a small plush monkey dangling from it. I had three thoughts at the time: First, ‘‘This fanny pack is epic.’’ Second, ‘‘This fanny pack needs to be worn.’’ Third, ‘‘This fanny pack has many useful pockets.’’

Melba Stone, an Australian widow, is widely credited with inventing the fanny pack in 1962. It seems entirely possible that she was inspired by a kangaroo. By the ’80s, the packs had become a fashion staple, along with perms, shoulder pads and Hammer pants. This short-lived trend quickly gave way to hate and small-mindedness. By the mid-’90s, the fanny pack was cast aside as a punch line — something so excruciatingly dorky that even Weird Al made fun of them.

For too long, the fanny pack’s cultural baggage has prevented potential adoptees from embracing its sheer practicality. To the unenlightened, fanny packs are synony­mous with the ugly American: the perfect accessory for extra-large, convenience-obsessed people. But to me they promote the greatest of our nation’s ideals: freedom.

Courtesy, Professionalism and Respect: In July, the New York Police Department’s 24th Precinct issued a warning on Twitter: ‘‘Summer=crowds. Protect your stuff. We @ 24 r not the fashion police but fanny packs present a special case.’’ An attached image labeled a fanny pack worn to the back ‘‘hideous and vulnerable’’ and one worn to the front ‘‘hideous but protected.’’

What other accessory ensures the safety of your essentials, with easy access, while also liberating your hands? The fanny pack, when used properly, enables a whole host of activities that other bags render awkward: a deep embrace, a dance party, the ability to quickly find and swipe and secure your MetroCard. Through its rare combination of aesthetic contrarianism and functionality, it enables a life of wild abandon.

I grew up a child of divorce, and perhaps being shuttled across town every three or four days for 16 years left me yearning for a small pouch around my waist that could hold all my essentials close. But I was about the size of a fanny pack when my parents split up, just 18 months old, so instead I had a tiny red Snoopy suitcase. I was a miniature Los Angeles nomad: a few nights on the Westside, then a few nights in Hollywood. I grew hyperaware of being prepared and packing appropriately — something I routinely failed to do. I would forget something on every trip: a piece of homework, my favorite Esprit T-shirt, a sock, a textbook, a Walkman, whatever — the specifics of the forgotten item never mattered. What mattered was that it always ended in fits of anxiety, tears, hyperventilation and, ultimately, many more trips across town.",REAL
The Propane-Fueled Endless Summer,"Photo

There is something wistful about a Labor Day cookout — something ever-so-slightly melancholy about putting those burgers and brats on the grill one last time before summer’s end. For many, the holiday marks the start of what Spy magazine once called ‘‘anxiety season’’ — time to ‘‘overstuff the briefcase, to yearn for a new apartment, fret about the raise, lose patience, work harder, fidget, stew, anguish, roil.’’ In anxiety season, we think there is no longer room for warm-weather pleasures like cooking outside.

Which is ridiculous. Get a gas grill going, and you can run it 12 months a year. Obsessive food maniacs sneer, of course, at propane grills, with their clean flames and lack of smoke, their ease of use. Grilling, they say, means cooking over charcoal or wood, means tending to fires as a hen tends to her chicks. It does not mean clicking the ignition on a propane knob and heating through some meat on the grate 10 minutes later.

Perhaps, but many Americans seem to disagree. In 1985, according to the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association, a group that monitors such things, charcoal grills outsold gas ones by a wide margin. But by 2013, the last year for which the association has data, the figures were very different: Manufacturers still delivered around 5.5 million charcoal grills to stores, but they also sent out more than eight million gas ones. We grill a lot in America. Increasingly, we do it over gas.

Think of a propane grill as an outdoor stove, and you will discover a form of cooking that delivers the pleasures of the summer cookout as easily in November as in July. This is particularly the case if you turn part of your grill into a flat-top griddle, or plancha. I have been cooking with a flat-top set over a propane grill all summer, testing a few different versions, including cast-iron skillets, a heavy metal sheet from Baking Steel and soapstone tiles from Canadian Soapstone, which makes countertops and has lately expanded into food-preparation tools. The soapstone in particular allows for nonstick, high-heat searing, but all three surfaces have led to superlative fish, vegetables, some steaks and all varieties of hamburger.

The cooking could not be easier. Fire up the grill, and allow the flat-top to heat through. Cook dinner. Turn off the gas. Scrape down the flat-top or haul the skillets inside to soak in the sink. Lower the top. Tomorrow you can do it all again.

Photo

Fillets of fish do very well on the flat-top, and you can cook quite a few of them at once. (Bonus: Your house won’t smell of cooked fish when you’re done.) Sliced tomatoes melt into perfection on a flat-top and don’t fall into the fire; you can cook them while the steaks or chops you’ve just seared rest. Weekend breakfasts are a breeze when you’re making like the diner man and cooking five or six fried eggs at once. (Lower the top of the grill to help the tops along, and you’ll end up with the best sunny-side-up eggs of your life.) Dessert? Sear some halved peaches over a pat of unsalted butter, or slices of apple, chunks of pineapple, whole bananas.",REAL
Is the Blue-Collar Shirt Still Blue Collar?,"Photo

A work shirt is a dress shirt with a job to do. Accordingly, it is designed with buttonholes on its double pockets, stitched with an emphasis on strength and constructed from a sturdy material like khaki or covert or, most classically, a cotton called chambray. You can have a chambray shirt in any color you want, and if that color is blue, you also have a social construct and a rhetorical device: The shirt’s blue collar is a mass-­produced idea as durable and versatile as the garment itself. With blue-­collar identity now more a matter of cultural style than of occupational history, the term is perfectly slippery, such that the assertions that Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin has ‘‘blue-­collar appeal’’ and an ‘‘anti-­union agenda’’ are not fundamentally incompatible. The phrase ‘‘blue collar’’ has flourished precisely because it is concrete in its imagery and vague in its connotations, vividly conjuring a labor-­class scene while sidestepping such a nasty word as ‘‘class.’’

The notion of ‘‘blue-­collar jobs’’ emerged in the 1920s, following the metonymic model of the ‘‘white-­collar worker,’’ who was, originally, not a professional or a manager but a pencil-­pusher. A 1920 usage by Upton Sinclair points the way, describing ‘‘the most bitter despisers’’ of the union workingman as ‘‘poor office-clerks, who are often the worst exploited of proletarians, but who, because they are allowed to wear a white collar, and to work in the office with the boss, regard themselves as members of the capitalist class.’’ In life and in literature, the white collar sometimes accessorized an empty suit and sometimes gleamed like the main chance. Its indigo counterpart proved more mutable yet.

To the Labor Department, blue-­collar workers ‘‘engage in manual labor or the skilled trades,’’ but in the mind of a political operative, the collar takes on special sociological shadings. In 1984, a representative of President Ronald Reagan’s re-­election campaign told The Associated Press that the incumbent’s victory would rely on the kind of blue-­collar voter who ‘‘can be a union member but doesn’t have to be, who can be a Catholic but doesn’t have to be and may be an ethnic but doesn’t have to be.’’ Elsewhere that election cycle, an aide to the Democratic vice-­presidential candidate, Geraldine Ferraro, promoted her appeal ‘‘to blue-collar ethnic males, who are thought to be the most macho,’’ thus making manifest a comment on virility latent in the concept. Sportswriters lean on the phrase to describe players grinding out wins by way of gritty defense and unglamorous hustle. The blue-­collar guy is, in laudatory references, unsparing in his honesty and unaffected in his manner; in the hostile view of Sinclair’s sniveling scriveners, he is a lunkhead scarcely worth the shirt on his back.

The early history of chambray ­stretches to the French town of Cambrai and a dense linen, cambric, long woven there. It came to the United States in 1790 when, defying laws against exporting textile technology, a Briton named Samuel Slater built a mill in Pawtucket, R.I., and produced cambric’s cotton analog by cross-­weaving a colored thread and a white fill. While the Western shirt, with a curve to the yoke and a mother-­of-­pearl personality to the pockets, became a cowboy commonplace, the more prosaic work shirt was hammered into the iconography of machine shops, quarries and high steel. Manufactured nationwide in the early 20th century, the shirts appeared under burly labels — Big Yank, Iron Ace, PowrHouse — and featured a wealth of detail and essential ornaments that qualified them as utilitarian triumphs. They boasted of being union-­made, vat-­dyed, Sanforized, triple-­stitched at the seams and sewn with indestructible buttons.

Enduring the work of demagogues and demographers with grace, the shirt settled in as a signifier of the apolitical Everyman. (The great poet of the shirt must be Stephen King, who, in novel after novel, writes them onto characters’ bodies, short for the common man.) At the same time, it slipped easily into its role as a marker of bohemian chic. In ‘‘The Adventures of Augie March,’’ by Saul Bellow, the hero tells us that his brother attended Communist meetings on account of the company: ‘‘He went for the big babes in leather jackets, low heels, berets and chambray workshirts.’’ At online boutiques, you can now buy an expensive chambray shirt named for Neal Cassady in an attempt to summon daydreams of a sainted beatnik.",REAL
The Intruder,"As with any scuffle worth its salt, a crowd gathered. A small one, composed of the mason; the carpenter; Pierre’s watchman, Jean, who had just walked in; and me. The neat-looking young man continued to claim his innocence while name-dropping his marabout. His backpack contained shiny, patterned clothes wrapped in clear plastic. He was speaking in Wolof, Senegal’s lingua franca, so I sidled up to Jean for a translation.

‘‘He says he was selling clothes,’’ Jean said. ‘‘He came in through the front door, didn’t see anyone and went upstairs.’’

The young man’s story didn’t make sense. He would have encountered at least two people on his way up.

Pierre found nothing in the intruder’s bag. The young man looked up to me, perhaps hoping for some feminine sympathy. He rattled off a string of words. I have a very Senegalese look (thin and dark-skinned), I am told daily, but I am from Ghana. I didn’t understand a thing.

Suddenly, Pierre’s hand shot forward and struck the man’s face. The intruder pressed his front teeth and, satisfied that they hadn’t been dislodged, told Pierre not to hit him. Pierre, flexing his fist in pain, asked me what I thought. Now I was to be the voice of reason.

I told Pierre to stop hitting the man, but I was stuck. Pierre is a white Frenchman. The intruder was very Senegalese. I badly wanted our dynamics to be different, and found myself feeling sorry for the man, despite his shaky story.

Pierre said that he had been robbed too many times, and that twice he had encountered a thief in his house. The first time, after he let the person go, he saw that his car had been broken into. The next time, the person got away on a horse and chariot. I, too, had suffered recent robberies, so I knew that the feeling of being intruded upon was hard to recover from. And yet I wanted to tell Pierre, ‘‘Let him go.’’

‘‘I’m taking him to the gendarmerie,’’ Pierre decided. Babacar and Jean led the intruder to the gate. Another scuffle ensued when Pierre asked to see the intruder’s ID. The intruder just flashed his wallet at Pierre. Jean said he claimed his mother was sick and home alone. No one would look after her if he went to the gendarmerie, so he would not get into Pierre’s car.

Pierre said: ‘‘He has a lot of money on him. I don’t want to let him go and hear that he robbed the neighbors.’’

‘‘Maybe get a gendarme to come here,’’ I suggested, my heart knotting.

Pierre didn’t have the number, so he called Malik, a local restaurateur and the go-to person for all things bureaucratic. ‘‘You won’t believe this,’’ Pierre said. ‘‘Malik found him loitering in his garden, too. He let him go with a warning not to enter people’s homes uninvited.’’

That settled it. Malik came over. The gendarmes were called, and 20 minutes later, they carted off the intruder.

That evening, the conversation ranged from what would have happened if he’d been found in a more crowded place — he would have been beaten to a pulp — to whether firearms should be purchased, to which Pierre and I were the sole voices of dissent.

‘‘People in the village said he was just selling clothes,’’ another friend said much later. ‘‘He used to sell to the previous owner’s wife.’’

How to Fight Fires From a Plane,"Photo

‘‘Your job is to slow the fire down and buy time for the firefighters on the ground,’’ says John Gallaher, a pilot who travels the country dropping fire retardant from the air. Every morning, check out of your hotel, and be prepared to check into another one thousands of miles away at day’s end. Always keep your packed bags loaded in the plane.

‘‘Think of it like a military deployment,’’ he says. Gallaher, 53, left his home in Washington in April and does not expect to be back until the end of November. Fire seasons are getting longer. This summer, Gallaher was subcontracted by his employer, Neptune Aviation Services, in Montana, to stay in California, where more than 340,000 acres have burned since January. Most years, he works for the United States Forest Service, sometimes battling fires in as many as four states in a single 24-hour stretch.

Once you reach the fire, join the so-called orbit of planes circling above and await instructions. To understand the cryptic-sounding commands — ‘‘Start at the heel and carry your retardant up the left flank’’ — you’ll need to be familiar with what firefighters call ‘‘fire anatomy.’’ A blaze’s start point is its heel; its head is the fast-burning forefront.

Learn to quickly read the signs of what’s happening below you. Smoke whirling in on itself suggests unstable air. A strong, dominant wind sends vapors into a telltale unidirectional lean. ‘‘Don’t put any part of your airplane in the flames,’’ says Gallaher, seemingly simple advice that becomes less so when flares leap hundreds of feet from the crowns of trees. This is not flying by autopilot. You will be swooping in low, over rough, unfamiliar terrain. ‘‘It is an environment that is terribly unforgiving of mistakes,’’ he says.

For the most precise targeting, open the belly of your plane — this season, Gallaher is flying a BAe 146 regional air carrier modified with a 3,000-gallon tank in place of seats — and release the retardant, a gooey mix of ammonium phosphate and sulfate salts, about 150 feet above the vegetation. ‘‘Your goal is not to drop on people, structures, vehicles or animals,’’ Gallaher says.",REAL

RE: CREATIVE CLASS

Steven Johnson wrote about the intersection of technology, commerce and artistic careers, finding that the Internet has helped creative careers to thrive. The Future of Music Coalition, a nonprofit organization that focuses on advocacy for musicians, published a lengthy rebuttal on its website, and Johnson responded with a post on nytimes.com. Both posts are excerpted below.

Steven Johnson’s article ‘‘The Creative Apocalypse That Wasn’t’’ frames itself as a data-driven response to concerns about the plight of creative workers in the digital age. But Johnson’s grasp of the limitations of the data he cites seems tenuous, and he ends up relying on some very dubious and all-too-familiar assumptions. … Our problem with Johnson’s article isn’t that he fails to conform to some doom-and-gloom scenario for artists working today. Indeed, there are a lot of new opportunities for artists, and those opportunities are worth celebrating. Most frustrating to us is that Johnson reinforces a false binary between pro-technology optimistic futurism and anti-technology digital pessimism. And that simply doesn’t describe the state of the contemporary debate about art and the digital age. If you want to know how musicians are faring, you have to ask musicians, preferably a whole lot of them. You’ll get different answers from different musicians, and they’ll all be correct in terms of their own experiences. But your overall understanding will better reflect the complexity of the landscape. Casey Rae, C.E.O., Future of Music Coalition

I don’t see that the article plays into that false binary. What the article critiques is the premise that there is a kind of underlying technological weight dragging down the economics of making music across the board. I make it very clear at multiple points that technology is influencing creators in different ways: making it easier for some kinds of artists, and putting new burdens on others. Figuring out the nuances of those transformations is what the F.M.C. is doing, with great success. But there are many people out there who still think that digital networks pose an existential threat to professional musicians (and other creators). That’s what my article was trying to wrestle with. Why can’t we see the forest and the trees? Steven Johnson

The creators I speak to every day as head of the Recording Academy, the organization best known for the Grammy Awards, are finding it harder and harder to make a living in music. Far too many talented creators have left the business, and we can only imagine what we have lost. Those who remain in the music business will be surprised to learn that the data Johnson cites put them in the same employment category as actors and athletes.

Johnson is right about one thing: The new music economy has freed creators from a single reliance on record labels to produce and promote their music. But the new market he describes does not yet offer songwriters, artists, musicians and producers the ability to negotiate with the new digital-music merchants for fair compensation for their work. Until it does, creators and music lovers will continue to suffer. Neil Portnow, president/C.E.O., the Recording Academy

RE: BERNIE SANDERS

Ana Marie Cox asked Sanders about socialism, Donald Trump’s increasing popularity and, notably, if it’s fair that Hillary Clinton’s hair gets more scrutiny than his own.

Asking Bernie’s opinion of Hillary’s hair? Really? The Times was once a place to go to for serious journalism; apparently those days are gone. How many more stadiums does Sanders have to fill before the dinosaur media outlets take him seriously? Sara Corbin, Brattleboro, Vt.

I guess I’m in the minority here, but I thought it was a great question. Why is Hillary’s appearance scrutinized while yours isn’t? He missed an excellent opportunity to discuss the bias against women candidates. … Instead of responding the way he did, I would have loved to see him say, ‘‘I understand what you’re asking and am disappointed with the portrayal of women candidates.’’ And then go on to elaborate on how he would try to change that.

The Meaning of Serena Williams,"There is no more exuberant winner than Serena Williams. She leaps into the air, she laughs, she grins, she pumps her fist, she points her index finger to the sky, signaling she’s No. 1. Her joy is palpable. It brings me to my feet, and I grin right back at her, as if I’ve won something, too. Perhaps I have.

There is a belief among some African-Americans that to defeat racism, they have to work harder, be smarter, be better. Only after they give 150 percent will white Americans recognize black excellence for what it is. But of course, once recognized, black excellence is then supposed to perform with good manners and forgiveness in the face of any racist slights or attacks. Black excellence is not supposed to be emotional as it pulls itself together to win after questionable calls. And in winning, it’s not supposed to swagger, to leap and pump its fist, to state boldly, in the words of Kanye West, ‘‘That’s what it is, black excellence, baby.’’

Imagine you have won 21 Grand Slam singles titles, with only four losses in your 25 appearances in the finals. Imagine that you’ve achieved two ‘‘Serena Slams’’ (four consecutive Slams in a row), the first more than 10 years ago and the second this year. A win at this year’s U.S. Open would be your fifth and your first calendar-year Grand Slam — a feat last achieved by Steffi Graf in 1988, when you were just 6 years old. This win would also break your tie for the most U.S. Open titles in the Open era, surpassing the legendary Chris Evert, who herself has called you ‘‘a phenomenon that once every hundred years comes around.’’ Imagine that you’re the player John McEnroe recently described as ‘‘the greatest player, I think, that ever lived.’’ Imagine that, despite all this, there were so many bad calls against you, you were given as one reason video replay needed to be used on the courts. Imagine that you have to contend with critiques of your body that perpetuate racist notions that black women are hypermasculine and unattractive. Imagine being asked to comment at a news conference before a tournament because the president of the Russian Tennis Federation, Shamil Tarpischev, has described you and your sister as ‘‘brothers’’ who are ‘‘scary’’ to look at. Imagine.

Claudia Rankine is the author of five collections of poetry and the Aerol Arnold Professor of English at the University of Southern California. She last wrote for the magazine about mourning in the wake of the Charleston shootings. Her most recent work, ""Citizen,"" was a finalist for the National Book Award and the winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for poetry.

The word ‘‘win’’ finds its roots in both joy and grace. Serena’s grace comes because she won’t be forced into stillness; she won’t accept those racist projections onto her body without speaking back; she won’t go gently into the white light of victory. Her excellence doesn’t mask the struggle it takes to achieve each win. For black people, there is an unspoken script that demands the humble absorption of racist assaults, no matter the scale, because whites need to believe that it’s no big deal. But Serena refuses to keep to that script. Somehow, along the way, she made a decision to be excellent while still being Serena. She would feel what she feels in front of everyone, in response to anyone. At Wimbledon this year, for example, in a match against the home favorite Heather Watson, Serena, interrupted during play by the deafening support of Watson, wagged her index finger at the crowd and said, ‘‘Don’t try me.’’ She will tell an audience or an official that they are disrespectful or unjust, whether she says, simply, ‘‘No, no, no’’ or something much more forceful, as happened at the U.S. Open in 2009, when she told the lineswoman, ‘‘I swear to God I am [expletive] going to take this [expletive] ball and shove it down your [expletive] throat.’’ And in doing so, we actually see her. She shows us her joy, her humor and, yes, her rage. She gives us the whole range of what it is to be human, and there are those who can’t bear it, who can’t tolerate the humanity of an ordinary extraordinary person.

In the essay ‘‘Everybody’s Protest Novel,’’ James Baldwin wrote, ‘‘our humanity is our burden, our life; we need not battle for it; we need only to do what is infinitely more difficult — that is, accept it.’’ To accept the self, its humanity, is to discard the white racist gaze. Serena has freed herself from it. But that doesn’t mean she won’t be emotional or hurt by challenges to her humanity. It doesn’t mean she won’t battle for the right to be excellent. There is nothing wrong with Serena, but surely there is something wrong with the expectation that she be ‘‘good’’ while she is achieving greatness. Why should Serena not respond to racism? In whose world should it be answered with good manners? The notable difference between black excellence and white excellence is white excellence is achieved without having to battle racism.

Who Gets to Play Tennis?,"A couple of miles from the old Hyde Park Racquet Club, on the former site of the Robert Taylor Homes, once the country’s largest public housing complex, a new tennis center is now being built with the hope of accomplishing just that aim in Chicago. The $12 million XS Tennis Village will feature 12 indoor courts, 15 outdoor ones (including four of red clay), classrooms, a track and a state-of-the-art fitness center. Kamau Murray, who currently operates the existing tennis club on 47th Street, is behind this ambitious project. Murray says he believes the facility could change the lives of thousands of young people in this largely poor and black South Side neighborhood, using a combination of physical and academic instruction to teach not just tennis but also discipline and resolve. With a facility of this scale, he also envisions high-level training and tournaments, helping an increasing number of local athletes develop into top-ranked juniors and college prospects in their own community. As a critical mass of serious players forms on the South Side, other young people from the surrounding area might be enticed to join in as well. ‘‘For this sport to survive in America, you’ve got to have a more diverse population of kids,’’ Murray said. ‘‘Finding kids in the community is the future of U.S. tennis.’’

When I returned to the old Hyde Park club one morning this summer, a tennis camp with 80 children was underway. The weight benches had been cleared, the courts restored and resurfaced and the commercial corridor across 47th Street redeveloped. Murray, a lithe and loose-limbed 34-year-old who also grew up playing there, was leading a dozen of his best players through an array of drills. Two African-American teenagers, twin sisters, slugged balls back and forth to each other, scampering inside the baseline and around a cone between every shot, alternating with two other girls, the rally extending for a preposterous number of strokes — 20, then 30, then 60.

‘‘Any idiot can hit a tennis ball,’’ Murray yelled. ‘‘Good players can hit it on the run.’’ He told them the key was to whack the same quality groundstroke whether they were sprinting or tensing up during a 10-shot rally in a tiebreaker. ‘‘Play every out ball,’’ he ordered younger students on a second court. ‘‘Learn how to cover an extra 1,000 square feet. That’s Serena. Run it down! Make them try to hit it through you!’’

Murray was 7 when he picked up tennis. It was a fluke: His parents needed to deposit him somewhere for the summer, and they heard about an all-day camp that cost only $12 for 8 weeks, hosted at the public courts near their South Side home. The son of a judge and a public-school assistant principal, Murray went on to become the de facto coach of his high-school team, recruiting promising players from local middle schools, and then attended Florida A&M on a tennis scholarship. The university later covered the expense of his M.B.A. while he served as an assistant coach. A onetime pharmaceutical marketing manager, he took over the tennis operation on 47th Street in 2008, renaming it XS Tennis — ‘‘A play on ‘excess,’ greater than normal,’’ he said. But every year since, the owners of the building have seemed on the brink of shutting it down. Murray began to sell the idea of a new facility on the South Side, one big enough to transform what tennis looked like in Chicago.

The city financed $2.9 million of the XS Tennis Village. ‘‘It’s going to be literally a college-scholarship production facility,’’ Mayor Rahm Emanuel told me. Emanuel donated $5,000 of his own money and wheedled far larger sums out of his deep-pocketed friends. But, he said, he mostly got out of Murray’s way when they were making the pitch: ‘‘I’m his wingman,’’ the mayor declared. In their pitches, Murray would marshal market studies and data sets, highlighting the work XS was already doing in 10 local public schools. He talked about the center’s capacity to help lift up the long-beleaguered neighborhood. It would spur private investment and add to a cultural corridor being developed by the University of Chicago just beyond the school’s traditional Hyde Park boundaries. Taylor Townsend, a teenage pro whom Murray coached on the tour for a couple of years, helped with fund-raising; having grown up playing on the South Side, she appeared as the fulfillment of the tennis village’s dream.

There were doubters, of course. Some in the Chicago tennis community don’t think anyone can fill 27 courts in a neighborhood still dominated by vacant lots, especially when tennis courts elsewhere remain empty and too many outsiders still think of the South Side as a place to avoid. Murray needs not only to raise an additional $3 million to complete the center; he will also have to keep the lights on and pay his staff while offering tennis at a price ‘‘nontraditional’’ tennis families can afford. At the groundbreaking for the facility in June, Bobby Rush, the 12-term congressman from the South Side, told the crowd of 200 that he initially opposed the project because he didn’t like the idea of government land designated for public housing going to tennis players. But he said he was won over by Murray’s passion and his vision. Alluding to Venus and Serena, Rush proclaimed, ‘‘From Compton, California, to Chicago, Illinois, it’s happening, and it’s happening right now. We are going to dominate tennis.’’

Two blocks from the old Hyde Park Racquet Club, at the edge of a city park, Tyrone Mason was feeding backhands to a trio of youngsters, commanding them to brush up on their swings to drive the ball with topspin. Weather permitting, Mason, 61, has presided at these same public courts most days for the past 25 years. Murray took some of his first lessons from Mason, and so did I. The courts represent much of what I think is great about tennis in the city. It’s not that they’re especially ideal in terms of playability. The overhanging branches of a tree extend over a baseline, interfering with service tosses on one side. There is often a clamor from Little League games, high-school-football practices or families that set up grills and sound systems on weekends. A bench nearby is a preferred roost of weed-smoking teenagers. And when Mason isn’t around, dog walkers use the enclosed courts as a run. But all the distractions make the tennis feel as if it’s part of the wider community, especially when contrasted with the snobby seclusion of the country club. Little kids press their faces against the fence, while adults stop to admire the play. Mason waves to drivers blowing their horns in greeting, and he speaks to most passers-by, whether he knows them or not. It’s the Jane Jacobs urban ideal of the ‘‘sidewalk ballet’’ by way of the tennis court. Parents often see Mason’s pupils hitting deep topspin shots and inquire about lessons for their own children.

Like tennis everywhere, black tennis in Chicago began as something a bit more genteel. In 1912, a group of prominent African-Americans in the city, many of them doctors and lawyers and businessmen, formed the Chicago Prairie Tennis Club. Blacks were barred from country clubs and, until the late 1940s, from official competition in what was then called the United States Lawn Tennis Association. Park-district leagues in Chicago weren’t fully integrated until the 1960s. ‘‘It wasn’t the epitome of success to play tennis, but we wanted to be included in American life,’’ Ron Mitchell, who has helped operate the Prairie club for the last 25 years, told me. In its early years, the group fielded challenges from black tennis associations on the South Side and elsewhere in the Midwest. It took part in an annual tri-city matchup among similar organizations in Cleveland and Detroit. The best players from Chicago went on to compete in contests held by the American Tennis Association, formed in 1916 as the corresponding national black tennis league. The first black player to claim a United States national title wasn’t Althea Gibson, who won the U.S. Open in 1957, but Lorraine Williams, a 15-year-old Chicagoan affiliated with Prairie Tennis who took first place in a junior division four years earlier.

Mason was already out of high school when he touched a racket for the first time, in 1972. This was just four years after the beginning of the modern pro tennis era, as players without amateur status were finally allowed to compete in major tournaments. On the South Side and the North Side and all over Chicago, it suddenly seemed as if everyone were playing. The coach I trained with the longest, a smooth-swinging lefty named Waverly Hill, didn’t hit a tennis ball until this same time, when he was in college. It was a revelation, he told me recently: ‘‘I knew instantly it was the sport I should have played all along.’’ Hill was soon spending most of his days at Tuley Park on 90th Street, competing against Mason and other fervid converts. Many of them got their professional starts teaching park-district tennis.

By the ’80s, thanks to these adults who had fallen hard for the game, there was a large contingent of first-generation black junior tennis players. They formed a close community that proved strong enough to eclipse many of the divides of economics and access. Their parents car-pooled to tournaments and group lessons. One of the mothers’ friends ran a tournament at a local park; someone’s father hosted a camp elsewhere. ‘‘It was such a great experience because it was such a family-oriented environment,’’ Katrina Adams, the star of that cohort, told me this summer.

Like Murray, Adams first joined a tennis group in the park by her home the summer she turned 7. She continued to play that winter on a gym floor in a public-park field house. Eventually she was handed off to Chris Scott, the South Side’s top coach, who was a Harlem Globetrotter for a decade before turning to tennis in his 30s. By the time Adams was a teenager and winning trophies, many of the adults from the local tennis scene were chipping in to help pay for her travel and her training. She earned a scholarship to Northwestern, went pro after her sophomore year and won 20 doubles titles over her career. She is now the first black president of the U.S.T.A.

There are 128 city parks in Chicago like the one where Tyrone Mason teaches. Although the courts at these sites are nowhere near as crowded as they were, say, 30 years ago, it’s still common all over the South Side to see a lone teaching pro staked out with a basket of balls, maybe a folding chair courtside. That’s not the robust tennis community that helped raise a Katrina Adams in Chicago, but so far it has sustained tennis on the South Side. The XS Tennis Village, a major year-round facility, might be able to do more. ‘‘With grass-roots programs you’re starting from nothing,’’ Adams told me. ‘‘Taylor Townsend started from nothing. I started from nothing. You don’t know who you’ll get until you get them into your sport and can develop them.’’

In the living room of their Hyde Park condominium, Ray and Onjada Richardson explained that they were practitioners of what they called the ‘‘Richard Williams strategy’’ of tennis parenting. Two years before Venus was born, Williams chanced upon a women’s tennis final on TV and saw a $40,000 check being presented to the winner. Although he had never swung a racket, let alone theorized about open-stance groundstrokes, Williams decided right then that he would have two daughters and, with a certainty and a level of detail that could only be seen as delusional if not for what came to pass, that he would raise them both to be tennis champions. Ray Richardson’s similar epiphany occurred in 1997, while watching a 17-year-old Venus Williams play in her first U.S. Open final. Neither Ray nor Onjada were tennis players, and it would be another three years until the birth of their first child, but they believed that Venus and Serena, as black stars of the game, would serve as the perfect role models for their children-to-be. ‘‘It’s the looking-glass self: See yourself, see the possibilities,’’ Onjada explained to me. (It’s what Serena Williams wrote me she is most proud of: that she and her sister ‘‘expanded the definition of who a tennis player can be. And the sport grew with us.’’) The Richardsons’ first child was a boy — Hugh — and Ray was determined not to let his plans be hijacked by football or basketball. ‘‘That’s just the experience of young African-American males,’’ he said. He introduced tennis early: At 2, Hugh was taken to hit against a wall, and at 4 he began lessons with Mason in the park by their home. Tyra, three years younger, eventually followed her brother onto the court.

Hugh is now a wiry, 6-foot-3 15-year-old with size 15 shoes, his sinewy arms and legs a gyroscope of synchronized motion. At Dunbar Park, a few blocks from the stadium where the White Sox play, I watched him effortlessly crack practice serves — 110, 120 miles per hour, as fast as some pros — the balls a blur ricocheting off the back fence. Later, Hugh suddenly decided for no reason to spend 15 minutes of his practice switching his two-handed backhand to a one-hander, a shot he’d rarely hit before. And yet his form was perfect, his timing impeccable, 15 out of 15 shots exploding off his strings and falling a foot inside the far baseline.

Tyra, 12, is only slightly more than two racket-lengths tall, but already her volleys are crisp line drives or precisely carved angles. On her looping forehands, her racket is a whip of light, delivered with a grunt of intensity. ‘‘Her potential is unlimited, especially if she grows,’’ said her coach, Richy Gray, a former local junior who played in prize-money tournaments. In one drill, Gray sent her side to side, chasing balls, Tyra stretching as she swung on the full gallop. On every single shot, she somehow managed to anchor a back foot to transfer her weight and send force forward. Her strokes ending above her opposite ear, she finished these running shots like a gymnast nailing a dismount, with no extra steps or loss of balance, immediately able to send herself back in the opposite direction to track the next ball. Waverly Hill told me that when Tyra was 4, she hit 26 balls in a row with him. At 8, she finished third at a national tournament. She was preparing for the Girls’ 12s national hard courts, a six-day event in suburban Atlanta; the previous week there was a conference call with national junior development coaches from the U.S.T.A.

As Tyra’s national ranking has risen, so, too, have the family’s concerns that geography will put her at an unfair disadvantage. Ray and Onjada work full-time, commuting to their jobs, and most of the group lessons with juniors of Tyra’s caliber are held in the suburbs, easily an hour’s drive each way in traffic. The better a player, the farther the tournaments (regionals, sectionals, nationals) and the greater the costs. While the Richardsons were excited that the new XS tennis center would basically be in their backyard, they knew it would open too late to help them navigate the critical next year or two in their children’s development. Should they send the children away to a tennis academy, which can run $50,000 a year? They were by no means wealthy, and they estimated that tennis was already costing them $25,000 a year per child, which actually seems to be on the low end of the junior-tennis enterprise.

The U.S.T.A. once thought it could remedy the unequal distribution of tennis resources, and in that way develop the absolute best players, by inviting all the top juniors in the country to a national training center in Florida, free of charge. Taylor Townsend went to the association’s training facility, as did Evan King, another African-American player from Chicago on the pro circuit. But the junior rankings are themselves hugely influenced by economics, favoring players who early on can afford the finest instruction and training and later who can get to all the far-flung tournaments that are necessary for both experience and ranking points.

The association has since discovered that its national training-center model can do more harm than good, because it requires that adolescents be removed from their families and friends and long-term coaches. ‘‘Everything that we’ve learned not just from tennis but from other sports really shows that the great athletes in any sport develop close to home,’’ Blackman of U.S.T.A. player development told me. ‘‘They aren’t shipped off to a centralized academy or federation when they’re 13 or 14.’’ Although the association is currently building a new 102-court training center near Orlando, Blackman said the national tennis body is also trying to fund players who stay home, offering grants for training, private lessons and travel. It has put together regional commissions of coaches that recommend potential champions who otherwise might not make it on to the U.S.T.A.’s radar. The more diverse the coaches in these commissions, Blackman said, the more diverse the players the association hears about.

On a Wednesday in July, I went with Kamau Murray and 75 of his campers to a pro tournament in suburban Winnetka, on Chicago’s North Shore. The event was a Challenger, the circuit’s second tier, with $50,000 in prize money split among all the participants, from the $7,200 allotted the singles winner to the $520 handed out to half the entrants for losing in the first round. The South Siders hoped to see 17-year-old Frances Tiafoe, the son of immigrants from Sierra Leone, who was the country’s highest-ranked junior before going pro this spring. From a very early age, Tiafoe had trained at Maryland’s Junior Tennis Championship Center, one of the country’s pre-eminent tennis academies, because his father was a maintenance worker there. But Tiafoe lost the night before, 6-3, 6-1, in the first round. ‘‘I want to be great — hopefully, I can be,’’ he told me later in the day. ‘‘I want to inspire other kids of color to play tennis.’’

The XS campers instead watched a second-round match between a Texan named Mitchell Krueger and a burly Ukrainian named Illya Marchenko. Each man stood six feet behind the baseline, sending rolling forehands deep to the corners and backhand lasers down the line. Their styles were nearly identical, the margin between their tremendous shot-making abilities slight. The campers, some as young as 5, looked on in bewilderment at a game that, at least at this point, bore little resemblance to anything they had experienced. The 21-year-old Krueger, already three years on the tour, was able to hit a few more shots on the run than his opponent and pulled out a three-set win. By then the XS kids were gone, drawn away by the news that Murray was passing out tickets for the concession stands.

I joined them outside the stadium court, and Murray began to tell me how important it was for his students to see black professional players. In the same way that they followed the N.B.A.’s Stephen Curry or Derrick Rose, they needed to know that it was possible to start the tennis process and end up on the pro tour. Yet even players possessing all the athleticism and skill and desire, he said, still could be derailed. He offered up the experience of Taylor Townsend. At 15, while at the U.S.T.A. academy, Townsend won the 2012 Australian Open junior singles title. But later that year, the U.S.T.A. said it wouldn’t pay for her travel to the U.S. Open or to any other tournaments until she lost weight. Never thin, Townsend was then the top-ranked junior in the world. Murray helped raise money for Townsend to play the Open. Townsend’s family reached out to Zina Garrison, who struggled with bulimia when she played on the tour in the ’80s and ’90s. Murray and Garrison went on to jointly coach her for two years, though she is now back with her childhood coach, the father of Donald Young Jr. As blundering as the association’s treatment of Townsend was, it seemed especially insensitive in light of all the talk of body type that swirls around black women in the game. ‘‘One of the things that I don’t want to happen is to find a champion on the South Side, tell them about all these great things the sport can do for them and they get to the point where the tennis community at large beats them down,’’ Murray told me.

As we drove the hour back from the suburban tennis facility grand enough to host a professional tournament, Murray said he hoped the entire tennis community on the South Side would get behind the new XS village. ‘‘We have a chance to create unprecedented access to tennis for minority kids in Chicago, and that access can lead to college scholarships,’’ he explained. And he didn’t see it merely as a Chicago endeavor, but a national collaborative one. The $26 million Cary Leeds Center for Tennis and Learning, with its free community tennis programs, opened in the Bronx earlier this year. Zina Garrison runs a tennis program in Houston. The next day, 40 children from the Washington Tennis and Education Foundation, in D.C., would be in town, and Murray was taking them and his own campers on a college tour of Northwestern University. If the current inner-city tennis programs succeeded, he mused, then more like them might also get started in Cleveland, Detroit and Los Angeles. ‘‘And then maybe I get to build another one on the West Side of Chicago too,’’ he said, half-jokingly.

‘‘The new tennis facility is really just the beginning,’’ Murray said when we were back at the 47th Street club. ‘‘It’s really, like, Chapter 2.’’ He nodded at the 35-year-old hangar of a building where we had spent so much of our childhoods. ‘‘This is Chapter 1, and the tennis village is Chapter 2.’’

‘‘How many chapters will you write?’’ I asked.

He didn’t pause before answering. ‘‘Ten,’’ he said.",REAL
The Lessons of Anwar al-Awlaki,"The Tsarnaevs, Chechen-born brothers who set off two pressure-cooker bombs at the Boston Marathon in 2013, owed part of their ideological training and their bomb-making skills to Awlaki’s online work. ‘‘Listen to Anwar al-Awlaki’s ... here after series,’’ Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the younger brother, tweeted a few weeks before the attack, ‘‘you will gain an unbelievable amount of knowledge.’’ Chérif Kouachi, one of the Algerian-­French brothers who massacred the staff of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January, told a TV station in his last public words before being shot by the police that ‘‘Sheikh Anwar al-Awlaki’’ had sponsored the attack. The list of plots and attacks influenced by Awlaki goes on and on.

In fact, Awlaki’s pronouncements seem to carry greater authority today than when he was living, because America killed him. On Sept. 30, 2011, the day that Obama announced Awlaki’s death, many Islamic websites attached the word ‘‘martyrdom’’ to this news. Ten days later Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Awlaki’s Yemen branch, confirmed the death: ‘‘America killed Sheikh Anwar, may Allah have mercy on him, but it could not kill his thoughts. The martyrdom of the Sheikh is a new and renewing life for his thoughts and style.’’ It was a self-serving claim, but nearly four years later, it is hard to dismiss.

Awlaki’s collected works move seamlessly from praising Islam’s ancient heroes to calling for slaughter in the name of Allah. And this rich afterlife on the web raises disturbing questions: Is Awlaki as dangerous — perhaps even more dangerous — dead than alive? Was there a way to undermine his message without giving it the gloss of martyrdom? To answer these questions, which have implications for the broader American strategy against terrorist groups, it is necessary to understand Awlaki’s own evolution, including his interaction with American authorities, a story that has long been misunderstood.

Some government agencies have tried to boil the process of radicalization down to a few clear-cut and inevitable stages, but in reality, the journey to extremism is a messy, human affair that defies such predictability. This was true of Awlaki’s acolytes; it was also true of the great radicalizer himself. Before Awlaki could talk anyone else into violent jihad, he had to talk himself into it. One giant step came as the unintended result of surveillance by the United States government.

At midnight on Sept. 14, 2001, Awlaki, then a young Yemeni-American imam at the prominent Dar al-Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, Va., finished a long day by answering an email from his younger brother about the terrorist attacks of a few days before. ‘‘I personally think it was horrible,’’ he wrote to Ammar, a college student in New Mexico at the time. ‘‘I am very upset about it.’’ He added, ‘‘The media are all over us.’’ Anwar was disconcerted, but perhaps also pleased that an onslaught of reporters had turned his Friday prayers, or jummah, into a circus. ‘‘At jummah today we had ABC, NBC, CBS and The Washington Post.’’ He closed on a positive note, hinting at a noble purpose, to be sure, but also displaying a trace of personal ambition: ‘‘I hope we can use this for the good of all of us.’’

Though the country was in mourning, a sense of defiant unity emerged. A non-Muslim neighbor of Dar al-Hijrah organized a candlelight vigil around the building to show solidarity with the mosque. Roughly 80 residents of a nearby apartment building sent over a note saying, ‘‘We want your congregation to know that we welcome you in this community.’’ Journalists, hunting for an authoritative voice from the Muslim community, began to pass regularly under the mosque’s grand marble arches or to gather in Awlaki’s modest family home. He denounced the 9/11 attacks but in the same breath would criticize America’s record in the Middle East. Reporters were impressed. The New York Times wrote that Awlaki, just 30, was being ‘‘held up as a new generation of Muslim leader capable of merging East and West.’’ He relished the spotlight. He seemed to be quite self-consciously auditioning for a dual role: explainer of Islam to America and of America to Muslims. ‘‘We came here to build, not to destroy,’’ he declared from his pulpit. ‘‘We are the bridge between America and one billion Muslims worldwide.’’

Awlaki’s rise was a rapid one. Born in New Mexico in 1971, he lived in the United States until he was 7, while his father was in graduate school studying agriculture, then moved to Yemen with his family before returning for college at 19. At Colorado State, he was soon bored by his major in civil engineering and didn’t last long at the entry-level engineering job that followed. But he had discovered a knack for preaching, taking turns with other students and professors to lead prayers at the little mosque just off campus. He quickly landed a part-time position at the Denver Islamic Society. As an imam there and later in San Diego, he won over diverse, sometimes fractious communities. Older immigrants were captivated by his respectful manner and his bilingual, bicultural charisma. ‘‘He had a beautiful tongue,’’ said one leader of the Denver mosque, a Palestinian-American in his 60s who did not want to be named praising a man who later became notorious. ‘‘He had a nice voice. He had earned the knowledge he needed.’’ Young people, turned off by older imams who spoke English with heavy accents and knew little about American ways, found Awlaki approachable. ‘‘He lit up when he was with the youth,’’ Jamal Ali, 40, an airport driver who prayed at the San Diego mosque, told me.

He was also driven, a young man determined to make his mark. Among the books Awlaki devoured was Stephen R. Covey’s 1989 best seller, ‘‘The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.’’ In San Diego, he accepted a growing number of invitations to speak outside his mosque. He found a publisher to sell CD sets of his lectures through Islamic bookstores and online sales; these would attract a steadily growing audience over the next few years. But in 2000, at age 29, as he contemplated leaving San Diego, he was still not entirely certain about career paths. His father, Nasser al-Awlaki, who had earned his doctorate in the United States and served as Yemen’s agriculture minister and as a university chancellor, was dubious about a clerical career for his son. Awlaki bent to his father’s wishes and pursued a doctorate in education at George Washington University, agreeing to serve as a chaplain there. A job as the head of a department at Sana University in Yemen’s capital awaited him if he wanted it, his father said. As it happened, while he was studying for his Ph.D., Dar al-Hijrah, a far bigger and more prestigious mosque than the one in San Diego, was looking for a young imam, hoping, in part, to compete with a radical storefront mosque for the attention of local Muslim youth. Awlaki got the job; he seemed full of optimism. He told his father that he supported Bush in the 2000 election and hoped his new job might get him an invitation to the White House.

That didn’t happen, but Awlaki quickly made his mark in Washington. He was invited to give the sermon one Friday in the United States Capitol. A team filming a documentary on Muhammad captured the moment. He lectured at a local institute that was training Muslim chaplains for the military. His reputation, spreading through his CDs, established him on the Islamic speaking circuit. With his Yemeni wife, Gihan, and their three young children, he explored Washington’s museums and restaurants and settled into suburban life.

On the morning of 9/11, Awlaki was returning from a West Coast visit and learned of the attacks while riding in a taxi to the mosque from Reagan National Airport. He was soon caught up in the sudden, panicky American appetite for information about Islam. He was quoted regularly in the national media. He made a favorable impression at the interfaith forums that became popular in the Washington area. ‘‘He struck me in his personality as a gentle man, very well read and intelligent,’’ said the Rev. Gerry Creedon, a priest at a Catholic parish in Arlington, Va. Simon Amiel, an organizer with the campus Jewish organization Hillel, recalled Awlaki’s speaking at George Washington University on the parallel traditions of Islam and Judaism. Amiel found him ‘‘cordial and friendly.’’

At his mosque, Awlaki argued for the unique position of American Muslims. ‘‘Yes, we disagree with a lot of issues when it comes to the foreign policy of the United States,’’ he said in one sermon caught on camera. ‘‘We are very conservative when it comes to family values. We are against the moral decay that we see in the society. But we also cherish a lot of the values that are in America. Freedom is one of them; opportunity is another. And that’s why there is more appreciation among the American Muslims compared to the Muslims in other parts of the world.’’

It was a paean to conservative social values and American exceptionalism that would not have been out of place at a Republican National Convention. But as with many preachers who thunder against ‘‘moral decay,’’ there was a side of Awlaki that neither his admiring congregation nor the national media were allowed to see.

On Dec. 13, 2001, a mild but blustery day, Awlaki drove his white Dodge Caravan across the Potomac into Washington and parked west of Dupont Circle. Such solo drives had become routine for him, though the destinations varied; sometimes it was a motel in a rundown part of the city, sometimes it was more upscale lodging in the Virginia suburbs. On this occasion, it was the Marriott Residence Inn on P Street toward the end of the holy month of Ramadan. A few weeks earlier, in an online chat accompanying a Washington Post video, he explained that Muslims abstained from sexual activity during Ramadan between sunrise and sunset. It was 2:30 p.m. when he made his way to Room 1010, where a young woman from Texas awaited him.

He was a computer engineer, Awlaki told her, born in India and now living in California. He was polite and apologized for sneezing so much, explaining that he was suffering from hay fever. He handed over $220, and she performed oral sex on him. He ‘‘finished very quickly’’ and asked her for another round, the woman would later recount. She said he would have to pay another $220 — she was trying to raise the money to go to college in Florida. He said he would pay again only for full sexual intercourse. She declined, and he went on his way.

Every detail of Awlaki’s encounters with prostitutes was being recorded in government files. It was not that the government especially cared about his sex life. But soon after 9/11, in the frantic hunt for clues to the next attack, the F.B.I. discovered that two of the hijackers, Nawaz al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, had prayed at Awlaki’s mosque in San Diego, and some congregants thought they remembered seeing Hazmi enter Awlaki’s study for private discussions. Later, Hazmi and a third hijacker turned up across the country at Dar al-Hijrah. Worried about this connection, agents interviewed Awlaki at least three times in the days following the attacks. They found him clear in his condemnation of the carnage, hazy in his recollection of the hijackers and obviously wary. He declined to show the agents his passport, perhaps fearing it might be confiscated. He opted not to answer when asked whether he lectured on jihad, possibly fearing that the agents, clearly ignorant about Islam, might misconstrue his answer. Not surprisingly, he did not allay their suspicions. The F.B.I. opened a formal investigation. A surveillance team began following him 24 hours a day. His calls were monitored and his contacts vetted for ties to terrorism. His growing stature sometimes made monitoring him a peculiar assignment for federal agents. One day in February 2002, his F.B.I. watchers followed him to the Pentagon, where he disappeared inside. He was a luncheon speaker, part of an outreach effort to the Muslim community.

As the weeks passed, the bureau found no evidence that Awlaki was involved in terrorism. But the surveillance teams did discover that he was leading a complicated secret life. The F.B.I. listened in when he called escort services, followed him to hotels, photographed him surreptitiously on the street and often interviewed the women afterward. The voluminous F.B.I. files, released under the Freedom of Information Act, make for excruciating reading, detailing every occasion on which he paid for oral sex, for intercourse or just to watch a woman stimulate herself. One woman remarked that he ‘‘likes all lights on.’’ She found him ‘‘sweet.’’

He was also, of course, staggeringly reckless. He was a married man who stood on a moral pedestal in front of a conservative congregation. In one of his lectures, dedicated to zina, or fornication, he hailed the sanctity of marriage and denounced ‘‘the culture of Hollywood’’ for promoting illicit sex, including prostitution. ‘‘The movies and the nudity and the destruction of this culture is now global,’’ he declared. Every week or so, this same man was squandering his limited family budget for half an hour of pleasure. Awlaki had no idea anyone knew, and he kept up his hotel visits at a steady pace.

The reasons for Awlaki’s eventual departure from the United States, and for the steady hardening of his message that followed, have long been misunderstood. For years, anyone who studied his story assumed that he judged life in America as a Muslim leader to be no longer tenable. By this theory, the precipitating event happened in March 2002, when federal agents on a hunt for terrorist financiers swept through the Islamic institutions in Northern Virginia and the homes of their leaders. An association with Islam seemed to be the only requirement for being targeted, and the conduct of the agents carrying out the raids was often crude. Two days later, on March 22, Awlaki’s voice shook with anger as he made the raids the subject of his Friday sermon. He described how the wife and daughter of one local leader had been handcuffed for four hours, prevented from retrieving their head scarves, while male agents searched their home. He dropped his customary calm and declared, in language he had never publicly used before: ‘‘So this is not now a war on terrorism. We need to all be clear about this. This is a war against Muslims. It is a war against Muslims and Islam. Not only is it happening worldwide, but it is happening right here in America, that is claiming to be fighting this war for the sake of freedom while it’s infringing on the freedom of its own citizens, just because they’re Muslim.’’

A few days later, Awlaki flew to London for a planned speaking engagement. To the astonishment of many of his colleagues and friends, he did not return. Dar al-Hijrah put out a statement dressing up his disappearance as a sabbatical: ‘‘We have decided to transfer Imam Al-Awlaki to Yemen in order to take extensive Islamic law classes.’’

But the idea that Awlaki’s sermon was a coded farewell doesn’t hold up on examination. In it, he cited the experience of African-Americans to urge American Muslims to unite and fight for their rights. ‘‘There are no rights unless there is a struggle for those rights,’’ he declared. ‘‘And the history of America in that sense is very clear. African-Americans in this country had to go through a struggle. Their rights were not handed to them.’’ Awlaki was urging his fellow Muslims to stand up and demand respect. It would be an odd, or at least cowardly, moment to flee.

As it happens, there was an intimate witness to this crucial moment, someone who can help explain Awlaki’s departure. His younger brother, Ammar, arrived for a visit on March 23, the day after Anwar’s fiery sermon. (The F.B.I. duly recorded the arrival of a U.M.E.M., an ‘‘unknown Middle Eastern male.’’)

Ammar recalls that he lightheartedly asked his big brother just how long he intended to stay in the United States. ‘‘And he goes, like, ‘Forever,’ ’’ Ammar told me, his American English even more colloquial than his brother’s was. ‘‘I looked up to Dad and what he’d done in Yemen. I wanted Anwar to be the same. But he said, ‘No, I’m going to spend the rest of my life in America.’ ’’ With his preaching success, his comfortable lifestyle, his CDs and his growing national reputation, he had set aside his father’s idea of a post at Sana University. ‘‘He was totally planning to stay,’’ Ammar said.

A few days later, however, that plan somehow changed. Ammar arrived at the mosque one evening at the time of isha, the last of the five daily prayers. He found his generally coolheaded brother ashen and distraught. ‘‘He was in such a mental state, so devastated that he couldn’t even lead the prayer,’’ Ammar recalled. ‘‘He was angry, upset, sad, maybe confused.’’ He put off Ammar’s questions until the next day, when he took him to a room where they could talk privately and asked him to take the battery out of his cellphone, doing the same himself. ‘‘He said, ‘Something happened last night that made me reconsider my stay here in the States,’ ’’ Ammar recalled. ‘‘ ‘I was told that the F.B.I. has a file on me, and this file could destroy my life. I’m now rethinking my options, and one of them might be as drastic as leaving the States.’ ’’

Awlaki did not tell his admiring younger brother what was in the file. But a document from the 9/11 Commission records at the National Archives, declassified at my request, shows that a few days after Ammar’s arrival, the manager of an escort service called Awlaki to warn him that he had been interviewed by Wade Ammerman, an F.B.I. agent, who had asked about the imam’s visits to prostitutes. It was clear from Ammerman’s questions that the F.B.I. knew everything.

Awlaki’s panic, his sudden agitation about the course of his life, does not appear to have been triggered by American hostility to Muslims. Rather, he seems to have realized that his own un-­Islamic behavior had put his career success and family comity at risk. If the bureau charged him, or leaked the files, he might instantly lose the moral authority he brought to public arguments over the war in Afghanistan or the dubious roundup of Muslim men. If the F.B.I. chose instead to threaten exposure to coerce his cooperation, that might be even worse. Within a few days, he was gone, and he would never live in the United States again.

Despite the danger that he perceived from the prostitution dossier, Awlaki did not immediately give up on the possibility of resuming his American life. Awlaki was hardly in a position to tell his family about the menacing F.B.I. file, and his father pressured him to return to Washington and resume work on his Ph.D. Awlaki returned for one visit, in October 2002, but uncertain of the F.B.I.’s intentions, he did not dare risk staying. In fact, though he had no way of knowing it, F.B.I. memos from 2002 show that officials were exploring the possibility of charging Awlaki with a prostitution-related offense. A year after his visit, in the fall of 2003, he astonished F.B.I. agents by calling the bureau’s Washington field office out of the blue, expressing a desire to meet in London or Sana to clear up any suspicions, possibly as a prelude to returning to the United States. He mentioned media reports tying him to 9/11 because some hijackers had visited his mosques, which he called ‘‘absurd’’; presumably he also wanted to find out whether the bureau planned to act on the prostitution file. But the F.B.I. treated the issue as a low priority, and when Awlaki stopped answering emails, plans to meet in London fell through, records show. As late as 2004, when Awlaki returned to Yemen for what would prove to be the remainder of his life, he would sometimes suggest to family members that he might still move back to the United States. ‘‘He would always say, ‘Thank God I’m an American citizen and I have a second home to go back to if things go wrong in Yemen,’ ’’ his uncle, Saleh bin Fareed al-Awlaki, told me.

It is a tantalizing period, hinting at an alternate history. What if the F.B.I., recognizing Awlaki’s influence and value as a mediator with the Muslim community, had assured him that there was no plan to use the prostitution evidence to charge or embarrass him? What if he had resumed his life in Washington and continued to grow into an important public figure? Might he have become a responsible leader, a voice in the debates over the wars in Muslim countries, the wisdom of drone strikes, the fate of Guantánamo? Might he never have joined Al Qaeda? The contemporary history of terrorism, not to mention his playlist on YouTube, could have unspooled quite differently.

Instead, Awlaki’s ambition took a new and more militant path. At first subtly in 2003, while in Britain, and more clearly after 2005, his rhetoric became increasingly ferocious, his embrace of violence more open. After moving on to Yemen, he was arrested in 2006 and held for 18 months without charges at least in part as a result of American pressure. Not long after his release at the end of 2007, angered by the Yemeni surveillance teams constantly following him around Sana, he would depart for his family’s ancestral home in Shabwah province, also the hideout for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Within months he would be part of the group and, soon after that, deeply involved in plotting attacks on America.

In 2010, when Obama ordered a legal review and then approved the killing of Awlaki, some civil libertarians objected, saying that he was being denied his constitutional rights as an American citizen. But some Muslim commentators publicly expressed caution for more practical reasons. One was Mohamed Elibiary, a security consultant and a law-and-order Texas Republican. ‘‘It was very clear, at least to me, that if you’re trying to fight a martyrdom culture, you don’t go make martyrs,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m sorry to say, I think I was right.’’ In recent years, Elibiary has regularly interviewed Americans charged with terrorism for the federal public defender’s office. ‘‘In that world, to the last person, you find that they’re convinced that Anwar al-Awlaki is a good guy and a martyr,’’ he said. ‘‘What seals the deal for them is that he was killed by the United States.’’

Beyond Awlaki’s case, concerns inside and outside the government about blowback from drone strikes have steadily grown, fed by the backlash against the unintended deaths of civilians. Among those victims was Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, also a U.S. citizen, killed two weeks after his father in what American officials call a mistake; they say they were targeting an Al Qaeda operative. Part of the problem with the focus on targeted killing is that it fuels the central narrative of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State: that the United States is at war with Islam, that it is killing Muslims and that the obligatory religious response is armed jihad. The suspected perpetrators of two of the most prominent foiled attacks in the United States, a plot to blow up the New York subway and the failed car bombing of Times Square, said their anger at drone strikes pushed them to act.

A number of high-ranking security officials, after leaving office, have also expressed deep concerns about drone strikes. ‘‘They are hated on a visceral level, even by people who’ve never seen one or seen the effects of one,’’ Stanley McChrystal, a retired general and former head of the Joint Special Operations Command, told Reuters. Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Al Jazeera English that he had concluded that drone strikes were doing more harm than good. ‘‘It’s a failed strategy,’’ he said. Bruce Riedel, a former veteran C.I.A. officer who has long studied terrorism, said drones have eliminated very dangerous people, but the government has become ‘‘drone addicted,’’ firing missiles too often in Pakistan and Yemen.

There can be no doubt that President Obama has thought deeply about the problem of blowback in the war on Al Qaeda — he campaigned for president in 2008 on exactly that issue. He denounced the Iraq invasion, torture, secret detention and the prison at Guantánamo Bay as mistakes that had become ‘‘recruiting tools’’ for Al Qaeda. The rise of the Islamic State, that monstrous offspring of Al Qaeda and the Iraq war, has only underscored the catastrophic repercussions of bad decisions. When Islamic State executioners dressed American journalists in Guantánamo-style orange jumpsuits before beheading them, it was hard to miss the reference. Today the familiar image of the Predator drone is scrawled in graffiti on walls from Cairo to Karachi, reflecting a defiant anger.

Speaking at the Pentagon in early July, Obama acknowledged, not for the first time, the limits of counterterrorism based solely on killing: ‘‘Ultimately, in order for us to defeat terrorist groups like ISIL and Al Qaeda, it’s going to also require us to discredit their ideology — the twisted thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks. Ideologies are not defeated with guns; they’re defeated by better ideas.’’ Underlying such statements is a concern, quiet but widespread inside the government, about the wisdom of American strategy. Increased surveillance and strikes overseas have almost certainly made the country less vulnerable to a major attack. But it is also true that the minority of Muslims worldwide who believe that America is at war with Islam, and that their faith justifies violence in response, appears to have grown since 2001. And jihadist ideology, slickly packaged and repackaged on the Internet and social media, seems able to lure an endless supply of new recruits to terrorist groups.

So, was there a better idea of how to deal with Awlaki once he had joined Al Qaeda? Yemeni tribes might have been induced to capture him and turn him over, but a criminal trial would have given a global audience to a mesmerizing orator. Martyrdom would have been avoided, but his YouTube presence would have lived on intact. A more outlandish idea was raised immediately after Awlaki’s death by Ed Husain, a former British militant who recounts his journey into and out of extremism in his memoir, ‘‘The Islamist.’’ Husain suggested then, and believes now, that a better approach might have been a careful, high-profile public release of the prostitution files on Awlaki. ‘‘He was an imam when he was up to these shenanigans,’’ Husain told me. ‘‘Exposing that, I think, would have discredited him and more important undermined the message — that they are these high and mighty, pious, believing brothers who are declaring jihad on the West. Expose them for what they are.’’

Such a move would, of course, have raised its own dilemmas and risks. There is something unsavory about peddling sexual secrets, though that seems a minor objection if the alternative is execution by drone. For some, the suggestion would echo the F.B.I.’s deplorable attempts to use surveillance recordings to smear the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., however profound the moral gulf between the two targets. Awlaki and Al Qaeda could have been counted on to denounce the material as a fabrication, though its volume and detail might have undercut such claims. In any case, far from trying such an unconventional tactic, the F.B.I. kept the documents secret until long after Awlaki’s death, releasing them in redacted form only when forced to under the Freedom of Information Act.

Riedel, the C.I.A. veteran, said innovative tactics that focus on countering the ideology of Al Qaeda and ISIS merit serious consideration. The overreliance on killing, he said, has pushed aside more imaginative approaches. ‘‘We’ve spent trillions on hard power,’’ he said. ‘‘How much have we spent on soft power? We are, after all, the nation of Hollywood. We know how to make our case and sell a product and smear an enemy. With Awlaki, we could have done all of those things: We could have countered his argument, we could have smeared his reputation. Here it is more than three years after his death, and we still haven’t made the case. He still has this iconic status as a knight of Islam. And he was anything but.’’",REAL
Larry King Is Preparing for the Final Cancellation,"King is fixated on dying. Everyone is, to some degree, but not like him. Shawn King, his seventh wife, told me that Larry talks so much about his demise that he started to upset their teenage sons, and she had to tell him to knock it off. ‘‘He kept saying, ‘Listen, I’m not going to be around much longer, boys,’ ’’ Shawn said. ‘‘ ‘Whatever you do, don’t let your mother put me in a home.’ ’’ Recently, Larry and Shawn met with some insurance and lawyer types to go over their family trust. They were talking about his will and who got what and the tax ramifications. ‘‘After about 20 minutes, I said, ‘Wait a minute,’ ’’ Larry told me. ‘‘I won’t be here when this happens. I won’t exist. Everything in that conversation had nothing to do with me.’’

King’s father died of a heart attack when King was 9. That, he says, is what probably initiated his own death obsession. ‘‘I took that as my father abandoning me,’’ he said. ‘‘I had a psychologist explain that to me once.’’ Not a psychologist King ever saw professionally, but a guest on his show — his kind of therapist.

Over the quarter-century that he hosted ‘‘Larry King Live,’’ King was always asking his guests, ‘‘What do you think happens when we die?’’ I saw him ask that of the ageless guitarist Carlos Santana. Santana said that upon expiration, he expected to merely enter a different room and then receive a standing ovation from the likes of John Coltrane and John Lee Hooker. ‘‘So you believe they’re somewhere?’’ King asked. Yes, Santana was certain. ‘‘What makes you believe that?’’ King wondered. ‘‘You can’t prove it.’’ Santana suggested that faith ‘‘is acceptance of things not seen.’’ This is a story we’ll be following.

Luminary deaths accounted for some of King’s best-rated programs. He would host remembrance panels. He spent five hours receiving mourners via phone on his radio show on the night John Lennon was killed (‘‘Milton Berle called in’’). ‘‘Who elected Larry King America’s grief counselor?’’ James Wolcott of Vanity Fair asked in 2009, during a summer when King was convening nightly shiva on CNN for Michael Jackson and Farrah Fawcett.

‘‘At Richard Nixon’s library, the day after he was taken to the hospital, if you look at his calendar, it says ‘Larry King Live,’ ’’ King told me. ‘‘He was going to be on my show, but he died.’’ The same thing happened with Bart Giamatti, the commissioner of baseball, in 1989: ‘‘He was supposed to come on my show a few days after he had his heart attack.’’

King had planned to have one of his all-time favorite guests, Mario Cuomo, speak at his funeral. But then Cuomo went and abandoned him, too, last January, at just 82. Maybe Bill Clinton would be willing to speak instead, King wondered. He likes Clinton. ‘‘I bet he’d do it.’’ King flashed a satisfied smile, but then his face suddenly went blank. He tends to do this, as if savoring an image (a president at his funeral — such a tribute!) and then being slapped back to his default reality (‘‘But I won’t be there to see it!’’). He lingers on the unimaginable.

‘‘I can’t get my head around one minute being there and another minute absent,’’ King said.

Larry King died in 2010. Not for real, but when CNN pulled the plug on King’s show after 25 years, it felt like a dress rehearsal for the real cancellation.

King was 77 when his run ended at the network. He told me he could see it coming. Cable news had changed. It had become all about shouting, the left-versus-right paradigm and ‘‘good TV’’ — meaning spectacles. Fox News had gone right, and MSNBC had lurched left, and somewhere in the shrinking American middle was the once-dominant CNN, adrift in a loud new century. King’s bosses kept pushing him toward shorter segments, not the long-form interviews he always did while hunched over a bulbous RCA microphone with a pointillist map of the world behind him. CNN made him read viewers’ tweets on the air.

At the peak of his run, in the late 1990s, ‘‘Larry King Live’’ regularly reached more than 1.5 million viewers a night in the United States. That was a much smaller audience than network prime time, but King’s novelty was in his global reach. While international TV ratings are difficult to measure, King was the big rounded face of the network at a time when CNN was becoming the country’s signature media export. He was as recognizable abroad as Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton, and largely without the geopolitical baggage. His trademark eccentricities were borderless. Mikhail Gorbachev met him for dinner wearing suspenders. Paul Newman said that whenever he landed abroad, the first thing he did was turn on CNN and look for King. He was Newman’s own connection to home. King could be a cultural touchstone as well as a familiar background noise. Stephen Colbert told him he lost his virginity while listening to King’s radio show.

King was a broadcast pioneer who bridged the solemn authority figures of yesteryear, like Walter Cronkite, with today’s ‘‘good TV’’ yellers. He would talk about whatever the story of the day was, highbrow or low (presidents and movie stars and JonBenets). His style, endurance and presence became a form of American confidence. Conspicuously, King’s replacement, the British host Piers Morgan, was seen as a critic of his adopted country. He would use the ‘‘you people’’ construction, as if to signal that any confidence — America’s, television’s and certainly CNN’s — was no longer warranted.

Washington’s media-political fancies always viewed King with both respect and derision. The latter arose from King’s refusal to play the tough-guy inquisitor that had become the pose of so many ‘‘TV journalist’’ types. My colleague Maureen Dowd once called King ‘‘the resort area of American journalism.’’ King had an unabashed interest in celebrity and scandal, devoured the trial of his old pal O.J. Simpson and spoke at the funeral of his dear friend Tammy Faye Messner (formerly Bakker). Yet the famous and powerful coveted King’s audience and appreciated his unthreatening style. His questions were short, basic and often open-ended (‘‘Never been in the hotel? Never?’’ he asked Nixon, referring to the Watergate Hotel); solicitous (‘‘How did you emotionally hold up?’’ he asked Clinton); and at times slyly provocative (Why do you keep saying if the Holocaust happened? he asked President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran). He asked Ronald Reagan what it was like to be shot.

King let his guests talk until he became bored, which tended to happen quickly. ‘‘Larry had terrible A.D.D. issues,’’ says his brother, Marty Zeiger. ‘‘If there had been those drugs back then, he might never have learned to compensate and never would have become Larry King.’’

There is an old Vaudeville saying: ‘‘If you’re not appearing, you’re disappearing.’’ King appeared five times a week; he was the quirky uncle who kept showing up for dessert until you found yourself setting a place for him in the den out of habit. He appeared in 22 movies, playing (of course) himself. No one was appearing more than Larry King, until he wasn’t.

King’s friends wondered if losing his CNN platform and vanishing from nightly view would kill him, as a heart attack, quintuple bypass, prostate cancer and diabetes had not. They worried about him in the same way that people worry about older people falling into death spirals after their spouses of many years die. The analogy is imperfect in the case of King, who has survived quite well through the dissolution of seven previous marriages (he married the same woman twice). But the parallel still came up a lot during my conversations with his friends and family. ‘‘It’s like the camera was Larry’s lover,’’ Zeiger told me. King speaks of being transformed the second he went on the air. On his first day, his boss demanded that he jettison ‘‘Zeiger’’ (‘‘too ethnic’’), so he went from being Lawrence Harvey Zeiger, a poor kid from Brooklyn who in 1957 took a job as a fill-in host at a Miami radio station, to being Larry King. A revamped and royal identity was born the second the red light went on.

Television can be a brutally seductive business for those who become personalities. ‘‘Appearing’’ becomes their oxygen. Maybe that’s why they call it being on ‘‘the air.’’ As in: the air that King filled for decades and might as well have breathed. But then suddenly there was no air, no ‘‘Larry King Live’’ — was he now Larry King dead?

I asked King if he was ready to leave CNN or if the network fired him. It was closer to the latter, he said. He always received three- and four-year contracts. They offered one year. ‘‘I saw it as writing on the wall,’’ King said. CNN aired its last ‘‘Larry King Live’’ on Dec. 18, 2010. The low point for King came a few months after that, when he was watching TV at home on a Sunday night and learned that Osama bin Laden had been killed. King jumped to his feet. ‘‘I needed a car to come pick me up and take me somewhere,’’ King told me. ‘‘I needed to be on the air. I needed a red light to go on. But I had nowhere to go.’’

It was 2013 when I first discovered Larry King in his broadcast afterlife. I had written a book, and someone called and invited me to go on King’s show. Larry King? I thought he was long ago hauled off to the curb like an old Zenith. That was how most people responded when I shared — bragged — that I would be going on with Larry King. ‘‘Larry King still has a show?’’ they would say. ‘‘Is Larry King still alive?’’ It can be easy to lose track sometimes, especially of those aging, sick and canceled celebrities who reside in that purgatory between the where-are-they-nows and the obits. Did we miss King’s exit somewhere among the deaths of Roger Ebert and Jonathan Winters and Annette Funicello?

King had landed at an online production outfit called Ora TV, which was started by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. Slim was a longtime fan of King’s and wanted him to remain on the air. He funded the production company to keep King’s franchise alive, essentially, and even let King pick the name: ‘‘Ora’’ is Shawn King’s middle name.

Of course I would go on with King. It felt like a visit to the cultural grave: the suspendered icon sitting in Los Angeles and visible again on a monitor, while I sat in a remote studio in Washington. King closed the interview by asking me, ‘‘Is the Palm still the place to go in Washington?’’ Sure, I said. He asked: ‘‘Next time I come to Washington, can we have lunch together at the Palm?’’

We met at the Palm last March. I took an immediate liking to King, beyond the camp novelty of the encounter itself. (It’s a bit unsettling to sit in the flesh with someone whose image so wholly resides in a pixelated nether-dust.) We started talking a lot on the phone after that — a kind of ‘‘Tuesdays With Morrie’’ tradition, only with Larry.

King was thrilled for my interest. ‘‘I’m being followed by The New York Times,’’ he told everyone when I was nearby. ‘‘I must be somebody again. Go figure.’’

No topic between King and me was off-limits except one: Piers Morgan. King’s publicist, Jen Hobbs, requested that I refrain from asking King anything about the host who succeeded him on CNN. Things had become ornery between King and Morgan, whose own show was canceled last year. King said in an interview with Howard Stern that watching Morgan flame out in his slot was like when ‘‘your mother-in-law goes over the cliff in your new car.’’ Morgan then called King a ‘‘poisonous twerp’’ and a ‘‘graceless, petty little man’’ on Twitter. I agreed not to bring up Morgan with King. That was fine, because King brought Morgan up himself, almost immediately (‘‘What I didn’t like about Piers is that he made that show all about him’’). Shawn King, a self-described ‘‘good Mormon girl,’’ later weighed in, too — and in language hardly befitting a good Mormon girl.

King really wanted me to know how busy he was. He is now the host of three shows, on various outlets, including one about baseball (‘‘Larry King at Bat’’) on the Los Angeles Dodgers’ cable network. He does a lot of paid speaking gigs (‘‘white-collar crime’’). He endorsed a line of suspenders. On this trip to Washington, King told me he would sit for interviews with The Washington Post, The Washington Examiner, WTOP radio and podcasts, among other media engagements.

He invited me to join him at the Ritz Carlton for breakfast with David Theall and Jason Rovou, ex-CNNers who followed him to Ora. Everyone but King ordered eggs, which he found offensive. ‘‘I despise eggs,’’ he told me, and added, by the way, that ‘‘Jews like things very well cooked. Did you know that?’’ (I did not.) Other diners stared as King walked out after breakfast. ‘‘I don’t think people would recognize the governor of Wisconsin if he walked in here,’’ King said, referring to Scott Walker, the presidential candidate. A dark-skinned man approached and asked King if he would pose for a photo.

‘‘Where are you from?’’ King asked.

‘‘Saudi Arabia,’’ the man said.

‘‘I’m a Jew!’’ King informed him. ‘‘You sure it’s O.K. to get your picture taken with a Jew back in Saudi Arabia?’’

The man assured him that indeed Larry King had many fans in Saudi Arabia. They smiled for the picture. ‘‘Thank you, Mr. King,’’ the man said. They shook hands, and King looked him in the eye. ‘‘Now,’’ he said, ‘‘please, go fight ISIS!’’

That night, King would be appearing at the Newseum, a cutesy-named gallery of American journalism history on Pennsylvania Avenue. The event was billed as ‘‘A Life in Broadcasting: A Conversation With Larry King,’’ and he was interviewed onstage by the former CNN anchor Leon Harris. ‘‘A black and a Jew!’’ King said, referring to Harris and himself. King then took it further and asked Harris, ‘‘Why did you want to eat at Woolworth?’’ Nervous laughs and a few gasps: Uncle Larry had arrived at the Seder.

King removed his jacket to reveal purple suspenders, and Harris listed career credits. He called King ‘‘an innovator’’ for nearly seven decades and ‘‘cable’s version of Walter Cronkite.’’ They talked about King’s old USA Today column, a weekly hodgepodge of one-note items, opinions and plugs, as ‘‘a forerunner to Twitter.’’

‘‘I never thought I would be a forerunner,’’ King said. The column was widely read, and mocked, notably by the comedian Norm Macdonald in a ‘‘Saturday Night Live’’ skit from the late 1990s. Macdonald would look into the camera and shout proclamations in King’s voice. He nailed its energetic banality. (‘‘Here is the dirty truth, gang: Poland Spring water does not come from Poland!’’)

Jerry Seinfeld credits King with inventing the random spirit of Twitter years before the technology enabled it. ‘‘Larry King didn’t invent drivel, but he certainly created the business model for drivel, which was the column in USA Today,’’ Seinfeld told me. No disrespect to drivel: ‘‘I’ve made a pretty nice living off of drivel myself,’’ he said.

King’s Twitter feed, @kingsthings, has become a cult-camp sensation, with 2.6 million followers. He dictates his projectiles into a dedicated voice-mail box. From there, an assistant transcribes them onto Twitter. The result is an exuberant self-parody, or a social-media burlesque, or (if you prefer) art. It’s somewhat indistinguishable from the verbal crawl I had been observing in person.

‘‘I rarely use lip balm.’’

‘‘Kiev is a hell of a town.’’

‘‘The fear of a colonoscopy is unwarranted.’’

He mostly produces them in binges, late on Sunday nights. They are best consumed in binges too, one after another, as if you’re speed-eating M&Ms one at a time. Seinfeld told me that King translates so well to Twitter because he understands portion size. ‘‘Sometimes we just want to experience verbiage but nothing that requires any mental digestion,’’ Seinfeld said. ‘‘The question is: Is he going to get even better when he enters dementia?’’

‘‘The rat is perfectly named.’’

‘‘It’s strange, but I just thought about my tricycle.’’

‘‘I love to scratch an itch.’’

The tweets convey wistfulness at times. There are notes of longing, nostalgia and mourning.

‘‘I can’t stop thinking about the late Mario Cuomo… I miss him so much.’’

‘‘Do you funeral homes ever have a bad year?’’

‘‘I love the sound of little kids in a schoolyard.’’

The Newseum conversation eventually veered to the specter of King’s final episode, his death. How can a story end well if he winds up in the ground? He is planning to avoid that, he told Harris. King takes four human growth hormone pills every day. People think H.G.H. is illegal because athletes are suspended for using it. It is not, King says, and he feels great. But in case of death, King wants the Ted Williams treatment. He has arranged to have his body frozen and then thawed out when researchers discover a cure for whatever killed him — the so-called cryonics approach. (Unlike Williams, King does not wish to have his dead head cut off.) King told me later that the people behind cryonics are ‘‘all nuts,’’ but at least if he knows he will be frozen he will die with a shred of hope. ‘‘Other people have no hope,’’ King said.

In May, I turned 50. The milestone came and went and left no great psychic toll. But I found myself doing more mortality math in my head than I ever had — how many more years did I have with my kids and in my job and on this earth? I was checking the relevance clock and wondering how long before I’d be ‘‘aged out’’ myself. It occurred to me that I no longer belonged to the 18-49 demographic that TV people refer to as the ‘‘key demo.’’

I visited King at the Ora studio in Glendale, Calif. The office resembled an Internet start-up: young staff members, snacks in the waiting room. Covering the walls were photos of the octogenarian maestro posing with world leaders, the Dalai Lama and Betty White. King took a seat on a couch and grabbed his powder blue suspenders with both hands, as if he were strapping in for a ride. Over his left shoulder was a photo of him standing between Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson while Tyson pretended to take a bite out of King’s ear.

King was getting ready to tape ‘‘Larry King Now.’’ It was a long way from CNN, but there was still a red light. King’s show is also available on Hulu and RT, the Russian state-funded television network. King is defensive about the latter. ‘‘I do not work for the Russian government!’’ he mentioned more than once. The broadcast is not subject to any approval or censorship by the Russians, as far as he knows.

The big ‘‘get’’ for that day’s show was the rapper known as Bow Wow (formerly Lil Bow Wow). Before Bow Wow arrived, King dispatched with preliminary interviews that included the author of a book called ‘‘The Rise of ISIS,’’ which King mistakenly called ‘‘The Rise of Iris.’’ This was not the first time King had called the terror brigade ‘‘Iris.’’ He has history with an Iris — Iris Siegel, a long-ago teenage crush. ‘‘Iris Siegel was every boy at Lafayette High School’s masturbatory fantasy,’’ King told me, and then for some reason felt that this required elaboration. ‘‘We all masturbated to Iris Siegel!’’

Between segments, King joined me in the waiting area while a makeup woman touched up his forehead. His flip phone vibrated. Shawn was calling. ‘‘I’m sitting here with a big admirer of yours,’’ King said. ‘‘You know, he works for The New York Times, so we both work for Carlos Slim’’ — King was always reminding me about how Slim owned a big chunk of the newspaper. A cluster of people entered the office. ‘‘And Bow Wow has arrived,’’ King announced, hanging up on Shawn.

Bow Wow, whose real name is Shad Moss, enlisted King in a selfie. He called King ‘‘iconic’’ and appeared slightly nervous. ‘‘Larry is huge with rappers,’’ David Theall explained to me. I sat in the control room while King walked Bow Wow onto the set. The interview started, and King's questions were awesome:

‘‘What makes a good rapper?’’

‘‘Is it singing?’’

‘‘You can hum a rap song?’’

In response to a query about his upbringing, Bow Wow told King that his father was never in the picture, which inspired this declaration from the host: ‘‘The strongest individual in America is the black single mother!’’ King closed with a lightning round in which he asked, If you could have one superpower, what would it be? Bow Wow answered that he would like to be invisible.

‘‘Me, too!’’ King exploded.

Later, I mentioned to King that I was surprised by his dream of invisibility. It was the opposite of what I expected from someone who relished being so present and seen. ‘‘Oh, but think about it,’’ King said. ‘‘If I could be invisible, I could walk on a plane, I wouldn’t need a ticket and I could sit with the pilot.’’ He would reap such a bonanza of consequence-free mischief and information. But if he were invisible, then how would he disseminate what he learned? No one would see him on TV. King made an adjustment: He told me he would like the ability to go back and forth between visible and invisible. He could still have dinner with friends. And then he could make himself invisible and follow them home. ‘‘Would I like to see my friends having sex? Yes.’’

He added the caveat that his friends wouldn’t be at their current ages. ‘‘Unless they have pretty wives.’’

Shawn King, who is 55, can be both protective and contemptuous of her husband. Wife No. 7 has been the current Mrs. King for nearly 18 years. They met outside Tiffany’s in Beverly Hills, in a chance encounter that inspired the name of their first son, Chance, now 16. Their second son, Cannon, 15, was named after the street he was conceived on, North Canon Drive. (King clarified that the event actually transpired in a house, not on the pavement.) King’s marriage to Shawn, an actress, singer and former homecoming queen at North Hollywood High School, is the only one of his eight that has lasted into double digits. King has three grown children with his previous wives; some of the women from his past have spoken most uncharitably about King in various forums — recurring themes being infidelity, immaturity, self-absorption and deception.

But he’s capable of great charm when pursuing women, and they often marvel at King’s wizardry in this regard. ‘‘When he was trying to woo me, he kept sending me over boxes of Hot Tamales,’’ Shawn told me. ‘‘He knew I loved them — the candies. It was very sweet.’’ He lured prospective dates to dinner with famous friends. ‘‘I love the chase!’’ King told me, and his eyes — gray slits behind glasses — suddenly bulged with life. (‘‘I love to scratch an itch.’’)

‘‘Let me tell you the story about the first night I spent with Angie,’’ King told me, referring to the actress Angie Dickinson, the star of ‘‘Police Woman.’’ King loves telling people, including me (three times), that he used to go out with her. Dickinson would seem the pinnacle of the former Larry Zeiger’s ‘‘look how far I’ve come’’ routine.

The morning after his ‘‘night with Angie,’’ King called his best friend from growing up, Herb Cohen. ‘‘Guess where the hell I am, Herbie?’’ King said. ‘‘I’m at Angie Dickinson’s house!’’ That’s the whole story.

‘‘This wouldn’t be for print,’’ King told me. ‘‘Or, I don’t know, maybe it would be for print. You tell me?’’

Inevitably the chase would end — with a warded-off advance, or lunge, or surrender, or wedding. And then King stopped trying. Shawn told me about an evening shortly after they were married. They were in the back of a limo, and King raised his left buttock and expelled a thunderous fart. Shawn was appalled. King merely shrugged. ‘‘What, do you want me to be uncomfortable?’’ said King, the incurable romantic. Shawn told me, laughing, that at that point she knew the courtship was officially over.

I asked King when we were eating at the Palm how he and Shawn had managed to stay together. They were separated for about two months in 2010. It was an unfortunate time. Shawn believed King was having an affair with her younger sister, Shannon. ‘‘It was just a flirtation,’’ King insisted. ‘‘I never made love to her.’’ He and Shawn reunited for the sake of the boys, and, King said, because they missed each other. He was being treated for prostate cancer at the time. ‘‘I’m still sorry I did it,’’ King said. I assumed he was talking about Shannon, but he was referring to the prostate surgery. The doctors were split on how to proceed, and King chose the more aggressive treatments. ‘‘Now I can’t get it up,’’ he said. He quoted the former Yankees manager Joe Torre, another prostate-cancer survivor — King is always name-dropping wisdom through his celebrity friends. ‘‘What would you rather do, have sex or die?’’ he said. The waiter arrived with more radishes, just in time.

The day after the Bow Wow interview, King was driving me around Beverly Hills in his black Lincoln. The car smelled new and was perfectly uncluttered except for a tube of Polident on the dashboard. A handicap-parking pass hung from the rearview mirror even though King can walk perfectly well (his father-in-law, who was not with us, suffers from neuropathy in his feet and walks with a cane). King leases a new Lincoln every two years, and I made a crack about his doing the same with wives. He did not laugh.

‘‘I understand the impulse to always be looking for something else,’’ King told me. That extends to the culture, and especially television viewers, who are seeking the next thing and leaving behind the old standbys. I asked King if, for the sake of changing with the medium, he ever considered becoming more combative on CNN. Never. ‘‘If you’re combative, you never learn,’’ he told me. He would always want to make his guests feel welcome. ‘‘Oh, I would love to interview Hitler,’’ King said. Ideally, it would be several years after World War II, had Hitler lived. King might prepare a little bit (‘‘maybe I’d skim ‘Mein Kampf’ or something’’) but would mostly improvise. ‘‘Hitler had a mother,’’ King said, and he would want her to come on his show too. He chuckled at the thought. ‘‘I’d ask her, ‘Why didn’t you have an abortion?’ ’’

We stopped back at the Kings’ house to pick up Karl Engemann, Shawn’s 85-year-old father. He is a sweet and gentle man, and an observant Mormon. King introduced me to his father-in-law and started in on one of his riffs about how religion is a big delusion. ‘‘Karl thinks he’s going somewhere after he dies,’’ King said, and his voice assumed a slightly baiting tone. ‘‘Don’t you, Karl?’’ Karl nodded, and King smirked.

I asked King how he’s so certain that the afterlife is not a portal to some glorious dimension. There was silence for a few blocks. This is a topic he has surveyed deeply: ‘‘Martin Short says people die every night when we sleep,’’ King told me. Sleep is like a nightly preview. I mentioned that people find sleep pleasant, so why shouldn’t death be?

‘‘I don’t know what I’m doing when I’m sleeping,’’ King replied. ‘‘I’m not anything.’’

It was early evening when we returned to the King house. Shawn was out getting her nails done. King disappeared upstairs and returned with a bottle of human growth hormone, which he presented to me as if he were handing over a cherished stash of gold pellets. ‘‘Here, some H.G.H. for the road,’’ he said. ‘‘I’ll send you home healthy.’’ He showed me the items in his den, or ‘‘trophy room’’ — the cardboard cutout of Sinatra wearing Jewish payos, the portrait of King made entirely of jelly beans, his Emmy for Lifetime Achievement. ‘‘Try lifting this thing,’’ King told me. ‘‘It’s heavier than the usual Emmy.’’ He mentioned that George Washington University has tapes of his old radio show, in case his kids ever want to listen. On the wall above the front door, he pointed to two bright paintings that his sons made in an art class when they were toddlers. ‘‘Carlos Slim told me these were works of genius,’’ he boasted. ‘‘You never know where you might find genius.’’

He kept walking me into new rooms, showing off various accolades and telling me of others. ‘‘You know I was nominated for a Shorty Award,’’ King said. ‘‘That’s for social-media excellence — for the tweets.’’ What happens to his tweets after he dies? Could they offer a few stray pixels of Larry immortality? Or will they just fade away and be forgotten? ‘‘I won’t be here anyway,’’ King concluded, ‘‘so what does it matter?’’

Everything was dark around him when I left except the glow of the TV.

‘‘If my wife is late for my funeral, I will be very angry.’’

King would love to attend his own funeral. He would watch invisibly over the proceedings and laugh. ‘‘I would like the ceremony to begin, ‘Today we are honoring a 160-year-old man who was caught in bed by an irate husband,’ ’’ King said. ‘‘ ‘And the funeral is late because it took six days to wipe the smile off his face.’ ’’

The service would be at a synagogue, out of respect for his mother. It is unclear what would then happen to his body, how it would be frozen and where it would be housed, to say nothing of his soul. But he wants a rabbi to say the Mourner’s Kaddish. Rituals are important. ‘‘I think Clinton might speak,’’ King mentioned, again.",REAL
‘Moment’ Is Having a Moment,"The political world’s obsession with the moment can also be found in the way we talk about culture. In cultural criticism, it is often no longer enough to simply analyze a book or a film or a song. We have to justify our interest by declaring that the product in question is having a moment. Benedict Cumberbatch, Marseille, ‘‘American Sniper,’’ Sweden, Amy Schumer, Compton — these are just a few of the entities that have recently, apparently, had moments. Then the critic must go one step further: to explain an even larger phenomenon, the ‘‘cultural moment.’’ As Buzzfeed recently put it: ‘‘Granny hair, granny panties, grannies all over popular media — what does the visibility of older women and the fashions associated with them suggest about our current cultural moment?’’

What, exactly, is a cultural moment? How long does it last? Who participates in it? Who on earth gets to decide? Can you marshal literally anything that has happened in the last 10 years, or 10 months? What are the parameters? Is there a minimum Q rating? Who has to experience a thing, be aware of it, find satisfaction (or prestige) in discussing it? And how do we distinguish kairos from chronos — a moment from an ordinary shred of time? How do we distinguish a meaningful, fateful, crucial moment from all the other moments that fall all over the place like bread crumbs out of an overturned toaster?

A moment was, at one time, an actual temporal unit: 1/40 of an hour, or roughly 90 seconds — the smallest discernible increment on a sundial. (Hence the sundial inscription, ‘‘Ab hoc momento pendet aeternitas,’’ or, ‘‘On this moment hangs eternity.’’) Today, however, 90 seconds seems long — a container big enough to hold many, many, many moments. Life in the 21st century revolves, more and more, around time-­slicing: switching quickly among many targets of attention — different screens, different windows stretched across those screens, different tabs open in each of those windows, apps nesting inside other apps. Cultural producers no longer seek to harvest long stretches of our attention but the teeniest little bits of it. Not hours or minutes but moments. We emerge from our holes of focused distraction with something like a time hangover: unmoored from history, alienated from chronos.

This is where the moment comes in. We master things by labeling them. Numbers, categories and hierarchies are ways of moving and storing the chaos of the world — mental technologies every bit as fundamental as levers and blades and buckets. (One of the world’s earliest forms of writing, back in Mesopotamia — the revolutionary scratches that turned us into literate creatures — was purely informational: receipts, inventories.) A moment is the atomic unit of narrative.

‘‘One tragedy of the human condition,’’ the sociologist James Beniger, who was an expert on the information society, wrote in his 1989 masterpiece, ‘‘The Control Revolution,’’ ‘‘is that each of us lives and dies with little hint of even the most profound transformations of our society and our species that play themselves out in some small part through our own existence.’’ Confident declarations that define the cultural moment are a way to ameliorate this tragedy. If we can’t understand the era, perhaps we can understand the moment. It seems so much less daunting.

And yet it can’t possibly be true that we are correctly diagnosing, 12 times every day, some serious new paradigm in society. That is not the nature of time, or of humans moving through time. None of us are smart enough to have such deep insights so frequently. Mostly what we’re doing is making the gesture of insight, the gesture of mastery. We are like astronomers looking at fireflies and proclaiming, in their flickering patterns, new constellations every 30 seconds.

When my wife was a child, her stepfather had a habit of declaring — out of nowhere — that their family was experi­encing a moment. ‘‘Let’s all remember this moment!’’ he would say. These declarations could come when they were watching a sunset or eating ice cream or loading groceries into the car; he seemed to declare the memorable moments almost at random. I recently asked my wife how many of these moments, now decades old, she remembers today.

‘‘None,’’ she said. ‘‘I only remember him saying that we should remember them.’’

The declaration of the moment turns out to have been the moment itself.",REAL
Bill Bryson Fears Humans More Than Bears,"One critic of the book said that you seemed happiest when you ‘‘unexpectedly stumbled across processed food or paved roads.’’ And you’ve said that as a travel writer, you absolutely don’t want to get malaria, be uncomfortable, sleep on anything hard or worry that an alligator is going to come up and take your leg off. Yes. Isn’t that a fairly rational position to take?

Absolutely. I was going to say that my idea of adventure travel is Airbnb. But to go back to that point, the person who wrote that was slightly wrong, because strangely — and I’m sure anybody who’s walked the trail would confirm this — you discover that you don’t want processed food and junk. What you actually want is vegetables.

You’ve become an accidental ambassador of science. You said that your book ‘‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’’ was supposed to be a one-off exercise from someone who always failed at science in school. Did you actually fail science? No, but I got pretty close. I always scraped by, but I never came away with any kind of an appreciation for the wonders of science. In that sense, I failed spectacularly.

You’ve also said that creationism is less magical than science, less awe-­inspiring. How so? If you’re a spiritual person, I think the scientific explanation for the universe, and how it got the way it is — the fact that it’s so vast and so ancient, and in all of this amazing void of space, as far as we know, the only living things are us on this little planet — actually makes God seem more majestic.

You live in Britain now, but you’re from Des Moines. And as we speak, presidential candidates are there, eating fried things on sticks. What does our presidential-election pageantry look like from the chronological and physical distance you have now? When I was growing up, the caucuses weren’t the huge phenomenon they have become. The only famous person who came when I was a kid was President Johnson. It was such a big deal that all the schools let out, and every kid in Des Moines went to it.

What do you think of the fact that your home state has such an important role in our presidential politics? I’m obviously biased here, but I’ve always thought that the Midwest is the most sane and sensible part of the country. And the closer you get to Iowa, the more it becomes that way. I really do sincerely feel that there’s a bedrock decency there. It’s the state’s finest quality.

Does your Iowa accent return when you go back home? No. I wish it would. If I try to make an Iowa accent, I just end up sounding like Deputy Dawg.",REAL
The V.C.s of B.C.,"The details of daily life are amazing, but another scholar, Gojko Barjamovic, of Harvard, realized that the archive also offered insight into something potentially more compelling. Many of the texts enumerate specific business details: the price of goods purchased and sold, the interest rate on debt, the costs of transporting goods and the various taxes in the many city-states that the donkey caravans passed on the long journey from Assur to Kanesh. Like most people who have studied Kanesh, Barjamovic is an Assyriologist, an expert in ancient languages and culture. Earlier this year, he joined some economists, as well as some other Assyriologists and archaeologists, on a team that analyzed Kanesh’s financial statistics. The picture that emerged of economic life is staggeringly advanced. The traders of Kanesh used financial tools that were remarkably similar to checks, bonds and joint-stock companies. They had something like venture-capital firms that created diversified portfolios of risky trades. And they even had structured financial products: People would buy outstanding debt, sell it to others and use it as collateral to finance new businesses. The 30 years for which we have records appear to have been a time of remarkable financial innovation.

It’s impossible not to see parallels with our own recent past. Over the 30 years covered by the archive, we see an economy built on trade in actual goods — silver, tin, textiles — transform into an economy built on financial speculation, fueling a bubble that then pops. After the financial collapse, there is a period of incessant lawsuits, as a central government in Assur desperately tries to come up with new regulations and ways of holding wrongdoers accountable (though there never seems to be agreement on who the wrongdoers are, exactly). The entire trading system enters a deep recession lasting more than a decade. The traders eventually adopt simpler, more stringent rules, and trade grows again.

In 1962 A.D., as our modern era of globalization was just beginning, the economist Jan Tinbergen — who would later share the first Nobel in economic science — noted something curious: Trade within and between countries followed a mathematical formula. He called it the Gravity Model, sort of an E=mc2 for global business. It comes with an imposing formula: F ij = G(M i x M j )/D ij . Which, simplified, means that trade between two markets will equal the size of the two markets multiplied together and then divided by their distance. (The model gets its name from its mathematical similarity to the equation in physics that describes gravitational pull.)

Photo

Since Tinbergen first published his finding, others have tested it on thousands of trade routes around the modern world, as well as on trade records going back a couple of centuries. In extreme cases (for example, trade between warring countries or during periods of sanction), the formula can fail to predict the volume of trade, but over all the model works extremely well. It’s a striking finding, suggesting that, for all the debate about trade agreements and currency rates, import duties and World Trade Organization disputes, trade tends to follow its own rules.

Economists were drawn to the Kanesh archive because it offered an unprecedented chance to see how well the Gravity Model applied in an economy entirely unlike our own. This was trade conducted via donkey, through a land of independent city-states whose legal and cultural systems were totally dissimilar to any we know. But still, the model held up: Ali Hortacsu, a University of Chicago economist on the Kanesh team, says that the trade figures between Assur and Kanesh matched the formula almost perfectly. ‘‘It was a very nice surprise,’’ he told me.

The Gravity Model may seem like bad news for people who want the economy to be fairer. I have spoken to countless activists and concerned friends who see global trade as a choice, something a specific set of politicians and businesses decided to impose on the rest of us, through all those confusing acronymic trade deals: GATT, Nafta and (probably, soon) the T.P.P. To me, though, the model suggests that these deals have less impact than either their boosters or their detractors imagine. There is a natural tendency for different regions to trade at fairly predictable volumes. However much politicians might want to change those outcomes, they have only crude tools at their disposal: They can stop trade through blockades, slow it through tariffs or try to jump-start it with trade agreements. What they can’t do, at least not reliably, is shape it with precision to achieve their preferred outcomes.

But despite trade’s intractability, we still have a lot of room to address the impact of trade on our economy. Trade with China and other nations may be all but inevitable, but growing wealth inequality and disproportionate pain (blue-collar workers losing their jobs, investors reaping a fortune) are not. There is much we can do within our borders to address the unequal impact of global trade. We can educate children for more competitive careers, train displaced workers for new industries or even directly compensate those who fail to benefit from global trade.

That, in fact, is what the people of Assur did, 4,000 years ago, as Barjamovic pointed out to me. Trade brought enormous wealth to a dozen or so families. But rather than hold all of it for themselves, the wealthy were made to redistribute a high percentage of their earnings through taxes and religious foundations that used the money for the public good. This way, the wealth created by trading with Kanesh made nearly everybody — at least every free citizen — better off.",REAL
Zip-a-Dee-Doo-#&$!,"Photo

The creators of Zoobe intended to make their program cute, clean and simple: a mobile app that turns voice recordings into 3-D animated videos, starring woodland creatures with gigantic heads. It was introduced in 2013 as a playful alternative to text messaging and quickly became a hit on its home turf in Germany. Users record brief messages on their smartphones, and anthropomorphic beings recite them back, in a video that can be shared with friends or posted online. The craze soon spread to neighboring countries, especially social-media-obsessed Russia, spawning some 170 million short videos that delivered short messages from the app’s cast of bears, rabbits and foxes.

While they talk, Zoobe characters dance and undulate in a disturbingly sensual manner, making the videos exploitable in a way that the Internet tends to quickly discover. Earlier this year, when English-language Zoobe videos began surfacing on American Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr feeds, the Zoobe menagerie adopted a saltier vocabulary.

Kylee Henke, a 26-year-old artist whose Zoobe videos were among the first to go viral in the United States, said that she started experimenting with Zoobe over the Fourth of July weekend, trading jokes with her family outside Seattle. The more she played with the app, the more she realized that obscene messages made for great videos. ‘‘The juxtaposition between the character’s appearance and the horrible things I have it say makes it 10 times funnier,’’ she says. Over time, Henke explains, ‘‘the language got more foul, because as it turns out, it’s hysterical to watch cute, fuzzy little characters yelling obscenities or spewing dark humor.’’ As Zoobe spread, it became clear that Americans were determined to put a twisted spin on the app, forcing the doe-eyed creatures to do their dirty work: ranting about celebrities, cursing out frenemies and complaining about daily indignities.

Lenard F. Krawinkel, the founder and chief executive of the company, claims to embrace this bizarre deviation. ‘‘I love it!’’ he says, adding, ‘‘I always hoped this would happen.’’ Krawinkel sounds genuine when he says he wants the service to be used for personal expression, regardless of how that expression evolves over time. That may be true, or it may just be that he recognizes the sheer impossibility of controlling a creation once it’s out in the wild — even one as soft and fluffy as Zoobe.",REAL
What We Learn From Old Recipes,"Photo

Out with the old and in with the new! Or so the saying goes. But it often goes the opposite way for me: In a reading life full of recipes, I like old ones better. I didn’t realize how much, or why, until I recently started writing a book updating a hundred of them — mostly from the 20th century, but all with timeworn roots.

There are pedagogical givens of any time. It is only when rubbed up against the givens of another that they show. The recipe of our age has a title that describes its ambition (like ‘‘Vietnamese Chicken Salad’’), then a list of ingredients and a series of calibrations — measurements, oven temperatures, time intervals. It is objective and idealistic, pledging to be ‘‘fastest,’’ ‘‘simplest,’’ ‘‘best,’’ ‘‘perfect.’’ It shies from narrative. It lacks contingencies — orienting itself literally and figuratively toward the supermarket, with its standard and constant inventory.

Older recipes, by contrast, sometimes skip titles altogether, using simply numbers or a Choose Your Own Adventure construction: ‘‘To Sauté Fresh Peas, With or Without Their Pod’’ (‘‘If you want to sauté peas in their pod, take the tenderest ones and cut off their flower end. ...’’) or ‘‘To Make a Quince, Apricot or White Pear-Plum Pudding.’’ Rarely do they supply lists of required ingredients, meaning cook it if you have it. Often old recipes hang their teaching on narrative, with an almost biblical surety that the way to cement information in the human mind is to plot it on a closely described arc of action. They are firmly anti-idealistic. They are full of contingencies.

I especially like the tacit admissions, often found in cookbooks of yesteryear, that not every meal will be extraordinary. In the preface to recipe No. 59 of his 1891 ‘‘Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well,’’ Pellegrino Artusi writes, ‘‘Among ordinary soups, this ranks with the best.’’ Being permitted a category of ‘‘ordinary’’ is a charity to any cook, especially today, when we feel obliged to apologize for anything plain. His previous recipe notes that its result ‘‘is good warm and it is even better cold.’’ Here, too, there is no end to the good that hint does, when what all cooks need each Wednesday night is cultural support for leftovers — as well as dishes that taste good that way.

Some old recipes, like ‘‘Omelette aux Fines Herbes,’’ from Alexandre Dumas’s 1873 ‘‘Great Dictionary of Cuisine,’’ conjure a bright-edged and pleasurable cooking experience through clear description: ‘‘Break some eggs into a salad bowl, and beat them with a wicker beater. ... Pour half a glass of cream into the mixture, and beat it once more.’’ Even without scientific reason, all other things equal, it seems better to froth eggs in a ceramic salad bowl than an impersonal plastic one. And there is irrepressible joy to Dumas’s end: ‘‘Have a platter ready which has been buttered with the freshest possible butter and sprinkled with some more fresh fines herbes.’’",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Brock Lesnar,"Photo

A World Wrestling Entertainment production tends to be a ridiculous spectacle: a brash, crass, gleefully obnoxious passion play where herculean men scream, threaten and belittle at the tops of their lungs, then work through their interpersonal issues in front of millions of viewers by pretending to pummel one another senseless, all while wearing colorful spandex. It’s hard to take seriously — that is, until Brock Lesnar enters the arena.

Even compared with other W.W.E. performers, Lesnar is a stark physical presence, a brush-cut block of heavy muscle and stoic menace. He rarely shouts or trash-talks; he barely speaks at all. Striding toward the ring in simple boxing trunks, his silent focus is singular and absolute. The crowd, which usually adopts the necessary level of knowing distance in engaging with their idols, seems to sense a difference; they grow edgy, alert. Lesnar presents a sort of rift in professional wrestling’s operative epistemology, upending its decades-old conventions and laying bare some of its unstated contradictions.

Professional wrestling occupies a unique place in American narrative art: It’s a ‘‘sport,’’ but scripted; it’s supposed to play like fact, but everybody knows it’s fiction. The W.W.E. loves to smudge these lines between script and reality. Did Wrestler A’s girlfriend cheat on him with Wrestler B? Let’s write it into the show! This whole combustible mix then plays out in real time, week after week, with fans following the backstage politics as closely as the on-screen story lines.

More than any other performer, Brock Lesnar personifies this tension between the “real” and the scripted. The son of South Dakota dairy farmers, Lesnar was a dominant amateur wrestler, winning the N.C.A.A. Division 1 heavyweight championship while at the University of Minnesota. After, he was recruited by the W.W.E. and entered the world of ‘‘worked’’ matches — pro wrestling’s distinctive blend of improvised athleticism and predetermined outcomes. But despite a successful championship run, he was hungry to return to actual competition. After five years in the business, Lesnar left pro wrestling and eventually found his way to mixed martial arts. In his fourth bout, he took the Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight title from Randy Couture. Soon he was reportedly the highest-earning athlete in the sport.

The opening lines to Brock Lesnar’s 2011 autobiography, ‘‘Death Clutch’’: I was living with a dark cloud over my head for 17 months. I had gambled every bit of my reputation as a legitimate athlete, and I was determined to erase the stigma of being a W.W.E. entertainer. All I had to do was smash Frank Mir into the ground. ...

Then, in 2012, Lesnar returned to the W.W.E.: a real, proven fighter back in the world of the unreal fight. Lesnar announced (threatened?) that he had come back to bring some ‘‘legitimacy’’ to the exercise, creating an electric uncertainty among the fans in the arena: Where was he going with this? How far could he stretch the already considerable suspension of disbelief wrestling requires of its audience? But rather than cracking the whole enterprise apart, Lesnar has become one of wrestling’s biggest draws, a performer whose every appearance is a must-see event.

Lesnar’s entire persona is based around the implied threat that he might collide the real with the scripted, demolishing the only constant in the pro wrestling universe: that the violence is fake. While some wrestlers have abused that tacit understanding between performer and audience, whiffing open-fisted punches, leaving too much daylight in their headlocks, Lesnar exudes danger in the ring. His jabs and hooks look for all the world as if they’re landing, hard. His holds and reversals have an Olympian fluidity. Of course, Lesnar would never actually attempt to injure another performer. He’s a skilled stage fighter, whose style harks back to wrestling’s carnival roots, when the matches were a con rather than a show and verisimilitude was a business necessity. In this sense, Lesnar’s appeal lies in his skill not just as a fighter, but also as an actor — in his ability to hoodwink even the most jaded audience in sports.

At last year’s WrestleMania, Lesnar faced the Undertaker, an unassailable veteran who hadn’t lost a match at the event in 21 appearances — his unbeaten streak was the centerpiece of the annual megashow. The question for fans was never if he would win, but how. His matches had become a comforting ritual, a chance to cheer on a living legend. But then he stood face to face with Lesnar, who, 25 minutes later, pinned him in the center of the ring. In the stands, grown men and women held their heads or covered their mouths in disbelief. Images of the stunned fans’ responses went viral. Online, people seemed to think these rubes didn’t understand they’d just seen a scripted event. Of course they did, but that didn’t make the match’s finish any less shocking — once again, Lesnar had blown up wrestling’s narrative rules.",REAL
Can I Wear Jewelry If I Don’t Support Its Origins?,"Photo

When my mother passed away, I inherited an antique necklace made of carved ivory beads. I love the look of — and am sentimentally tied to — this necklace, but I am also a supporter of anti-poaching programs and organizations. I have avoided wearing the necklace because I don’t want to appear to support the ivory trade. On the other hand, I hate not being able to wear one of the few pieces of jewelry that I have from my mother. What should I do with the necklace? J. F., TUSTIN, CALIF.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: I’m a bit puzzled about why wearing an antique ivory necklace involves appearing to support the ivory trade. If it’s antique, then the ivory was taken before restrictions on ivory were imposed. Of course, the reason ivory exists is that somebody killed an elephant to be used in this decorative way. Somewhere in the chain, there’s likely to be a moment when something rather awful happened. But I don’t think that you’re contributing to that wrong in the present by wearing this antique necklace.

Amy Bloom: Any antique jewelry, with or without stones, was likely to have been made under conditions that would make a decent person shudder. If the necklace was made before any trade ban, you’re not supporting those terrible conditions now. The other thing this question made me think about is people who criticize you for wearing ivory. There’s that wish that people have to comment on other people’s choices, whether or not they have the necessary information. It doesn’t seem to me that intrusive self-righteousness qualifies as ethical behavior, either. I would very much encourage you to wear the necklace and enjoy the feeling of closeness to your mother. Most of what I have from my mother is a couple of rings and a couple of necklaces, and I’m sure those pieces were not made in a charming, well-lit atelier. I’m still going to wear them. Ethical behavior does not consist of accosting people at cocktail parties about what they’re wearing.

Kenji Yoshino: I found myself more conflicted about this question than either of you appear to be. The letter writer fears that she will look like she is supporting the ivory trade if she is seen wearing the necklace. I do think that this is a real possibility. In an ideal world, any person who interprets her behavior that way would raise the issue (civilly, of course), and she would be able to explain her position. But for each one of those individuals, there will be many who misinterpret her behavior and don’t challenge her on it. What do we owe those individuals? I am not encouraging her to sell the necklace, but I did wonder if the wiser course might be to enjoy the necklace in private and not wear it in public.",REAL

The Countries Between Us,"After a couple of weeks, I struck up a friendship with a Somali woman who was about my age and quite religious but with a fondness for T-shirts and jeans. She was curious about me, and I was glad to find someone I could relate to. My acquaintance with her paved the way for me to talk with some of the other women, who were mostly African; they accepted me into conversations during breaks and after class. Nearly all of them came from French-speaking countries, and many of them wore the hijab. That surprised me at first, because when I studied at a French university, my Muslim friends didn’t wear religious attire in the classroom.

It also happened that at least four of these women were pregnant. Which is why I wondered out loud about something that day in the cafeteria: ‘‘So, uh, you have to fast even when you’re pregnant?’’

A woman from Guinea — she wore brightly colored clothing and stylish, sparkly veils — said: ‘‘Of course. It’s a religious duty, not something you can just decide to ignore.’’ Others said you should fast as well, although one Moroccan woman kept silent. But then a Catholic woman from Congo said: ‘‘What? When you’re going to have a baby, you have to stay healthy and feed your child.’’

The other Christian, who was from Rwanda, agreed. Someone else said it wasn’t a matter of choice, just doing what was right.

The women went back and forth. Everyone was very respectful, but they were openly giving their opinions with a level of confidence that I didn’t share. At one point, I explained that in Colombia, most people were Catholic but that I wasn’t very religious myself. They all looked at me sort of dumbstruck and then kept on talking.

At the time I was focused on why these women would do this. Later I found out that I was pregnant, too, and when I started experiencing some of the symptoms, I just thought of them and about how difficult fasting would have been.

Our teacher taught us that when you say what country you are from, and we worked on this a lot, because we were from so many places, the ‘‘uit” in ‘‘ik kom uit’’ (‘‘I am from’’) is pronounced like the French word oeil, with a ‘‘T’’ at the end. A lot of us had been having trouble with it, but it’s such an important statement. My question now is exactly how my child — half Italian, half Colombian, born in Brussels — will finish the phrase.",REAL
How to Sculpt With a Chain Saw,"Photo

First, get the right safety equipment. Before you rev up your saw’s two-stroke engine, invest in padded, cut-resistant chaps. A chain saw ‘‘can be a dangerous tool,’’ says Takao Hayashi of Yamaguchi, Japan, winner of this year’s U.S. Open Chainsaw Sculpture Championship in Eau Claire, Wis.

Second, know your wood. At home, Hayashi’s favorite is a red-colored cedar known in Japanese as ‘‘sugi.’’ In the United States, sculptors typically carve softwoods like pine and redwood; Germans generally use oak. Hayashi finds a log that suits his preconceived imagery; other carvers do the opposite, letting the particularities of the wood dictate its form. Like any folk art, chainsaw sculpture has its visual tropes — upright bears, big-eyed owls. Don’t feel obliged to hew to those traditions. ‘‘You should carve what you want to carve,’’ says Hayashi, who prefers African animals with unusually shaped bodies like hippopota­muses. Still, clichés can be practical. Hackneyed creatures tend to be ‘‘round and similar to the shape of logs,’’ Hayashi says, making them easier for beginners.

You will need at least three chain saws. To block out basic shapes, deploy a powerful logging saw with a three-foot-long blade. Detail work requires smaller instruments. With a good teacher, you can make a simple bear in a day, but it will take years to produce original work. Hayashi started as a 28-year-old carpenter, and in his first year he made 300 sculptures. ‘‘I would wake up in the middle of the night thinking about designs,’’ says Hayashi, now 43.

Among carvers, Hayashi is known as a purist who forgoes chisels, burners and sanders for the raw power of a mechanical saw. Even as he strains against its weight, horsepower and noise, the saw lets him shape a tree’s hard, fibrous tissue into something else entirely, like a dragon, or a squirrel holding a mailbox. ‘‘You can see the shape really fast, and I like that,’’ Hayashi says.",REAL

RE: BAIL

Nick Pinto wrote about the injustice of the bail system; every year, thousands of innocent people are sent to jail only because they can’t afford to post bail, putting them at risk of losing their jobs, custody of their children — even their lives. The article tells the story of Tyrone Tomlin, a 53-year-old construction worker who, minutes after buying a soda with a straw, was arrested on charges of carrying drug paraphernalia — the straw.

Yes, the bail system is broken, but the bigger concern is everything that happens before bail: Why is a police officer arresting someone for having a straw? Why is a prosecutor prosecuting such a worthless case? Why is a prosecutor allowed to ask for bail in such a situation?

The bail system needs to be fixed, but so does every step of the process that leads to a person being in front of a judge for having a straw in the first place.

Ben Miller, Washington

As public defenders at the Legal Aid Society in New York City, we were happy to see Nick Pinto’s excellent article on the sorry state of our cash-bail system. While he describes Band-Aid solutions like a bail fund and pretrial supervision, he neglects to point out that New York’s statute already provides for alternative forms of bail that would enable many more people to be released without onerous monetary restrictions. In 1970, the Legislature enacted a statute that allows judges to set bail in nine different forms, including a release on an unsecured appearance bond, which allows the accused to be released on an obligation to pay should the accused fail to return.

Currently, judges still regularly set only two forms of bail, cash or an insurance-­company bond. The time is now to utilize the system as it was intended. If an alternative form of bail is used, more people will have their freedom at no cost to the city, and the inequities of the bail system will be diminished significantly.

When I was a public defender in Philadelphia in the late 1980s, one of my greatest frustrations was representing clients for bail hearings at the Police Department. The expectation was that after this brief discipline of being stuck in jail because of an inability to post bail, my clients would successfully overcome the bail hurdle by their attorneys’ simply making another argument. As this article so aptly shows, that is not the case. Bail is a critical step in a process that says ‘‘innocent until proven guilty’’ but kind of doesn’t mean it.

Correction

An article on July 26 about Christianity in the Middle East described incorrectly a finding in a Pew study about religious hostilities. The study reported that Christians face religious persecution in more countries than any other religious group; it did not say that more Christians face religious persecution than at any time since their early history.

The Creative Apocalypse That Wasn’t,"The trouble with this argument is that it has been based largely on anecdote, on depressing stories about moderately successful bands that are still sharing an apartment or filmmakers who can’t get their pictures made because they refuse to pander to a teenage sensibility. When we do see hard data about the state of the culture business, it usually tracks broad industry trends or the successes and failures of individual entertainment companies. That data isn’t entirely irrelevant, of course; it’s useful to know whether the music industry is making more or less money than it did before Ulrich delivered his anti-­Napster testimony. But ultimately, those statistics only hint at the most important question. The dystopian scenario, after all, isn’t about the death of the record business or Hollywood; it’s about the death of music or movies. As a society, what we most want to ensure is that the artists can prosper — not the record labels or studios or publishing conglomerates, but the writers, musicians, directors and actors themselves.

Their financial fate turns out to be much harder to measure, but I endeavored to try. Taking 1999 as my starting point — the year both Napster and Google took off — I plumbed as many data sources as I could to answer this one question: How is today’s creative class faring compared with its predecessor a decade and a half ago? The answer isn’t simple, and the data provides ammunition for conflicting points of view. It turns out that Ulrich was incontrovertibly correct on one point: Napster did pose a grave threat to the economic value that consumers placed on recorded music. And yet the creative apocalypse he warned of has failed to arrive. Writers, performers, directors and even musicians report their economic fortunes to be similar to those of their counterparts 15 years ago, and in many cases they have improved. Against all odds, the voices of the artists seem to be louder than ever.

The closest data set we have to a bird’s-eye view of the culture industry can be found in the Occupational Employment Statistics, an enormous compendium of data assembled by the Labor Department that provides employment and income estimates. Broken down by general sector and by specific professions, the O.E.S. lets you see both the forest and the trees: You can track employment data for the Farming, Fishing and Forestry Occupations (Group 45-0000), or you can zoom in all the way to the Fallers (Group 45-4021) who are actually cutting down the trees. The O.E.S. data goes back to the 1980s, though some of the category definitions have changed over time. This, and the way the agency collects its data, can make specific year-to-year comparisons less reliable. The best approximation of the creative-class group as a whole is Group 27-0000, or Arts, Design, Entertainment, Sports and Media Occupations. It’s a broader definition than we’re looking for — I think we can all agree that professional athletes are doing just fine, thank you very much — but it gives us a place to start.

The first thing that jumps out at you, looking at Group 27-0000, is how stable it has been over the past decade and a half. In 1999, the national economy supported 1.5 million jobs in that category; by 2014, the number had grown to nearly 1.8 million. This means the creative class modestly outperformed the rest of the economy, making up 1.2 percent of the job market in 2001 compared with 1.3 percent in 2014. Annual income for Group 27-0000 grew by 40 percent, slightly more than the O.E.S. average of 38 percent. From that macro viewpoint, it hardly seems as though the creative economy is in dust-bowl territory. If anything, the market looks as if it is rewarding creative work, not undermining it, compared with the pre-­Napster era.

The problem with the O.E.S. data is that it doesn’t track self-­employed workers, who are obviously a large part of the world of creative production. For that section of the culture industry, the best data sources are the United States Economic Census, which is conducted every five years, and a firm called Economic Modeling Specialists International, which tracks detailed job numbers for self-­employed people in specific professions. If anything, the numbers from the self-­employed world are even more promising. From 2002 to 2012, the number of businesses that identify as or employ ‘‘independent artists, writers and performers’’ (which also includes some athletes) grew by almost 40 percent, while the total revenue generated by this group grew by 60 percent, far exceeding the rate of inflation.

What do these data sets have to tell us about musicians in particular? According to the O.E.S., in 1999 there were nearly 53,000 Americans who considered their primary occupation to be that of a musician, a music director or a composer; in 2014, more than 60,000 people were employed writing, singing or playing music. That’s a rise of 15 percent, compared with overall job-­market growth during that period of about 6 percent. The number of self-­employed musicians grew at an even faster rate: There were 45 percent more independent musicians in 2014 than in 2001. (Self-­employed writers, by contrast, grew by 20 percent over that period.)

Of course, Baudelaire would have filed his tax forms as self-­employed, too; that doesn’t mean he wasn’t also destitute. Could the surge in musicians be accompanied by a parallel expansion in the number of broke musicians? The income data suggests that this just isn’t true. According to the O.E.S., songwriters and music directors saw their average income rise by nearly 60 percent since 1999. The census version of the story, which includes self-­employed musicians, is less stellar: In 2012, musical groups and artists reported only 25 percent more in revenue than they did in 2002, which is basically treading water when you factor in inflation. And yet collectively, the figures seem to suggest that music, the creative field that has been most threatened by technological change, has become more profitable in the post-­Napster era — not for the music industry, of course, but for musicians themselves. Somehow the turbulence of the last 15 years seems to have created an economy in which more people than ever are writing and performing songs for a living.

How can this be? The record industry’s collapse is real and well documented. Even after Napster shut down in 2002, music piracy continued to grow: According to the Recording Industry Association of America, 30 billion songs were illegally downloaded from 2004 to 2009. American consumers paid for only 37 percent of the music they acquired in 2009. Artists report that royalties from streaming services like Spotify or Pandora are a tiny fraction of what they used to see from traditional album sales. The global music industry peaked just before Napster’s debut, during the heyday of CD sales, when it reaped what would amount today to almost $60 billion in revenue. Now the industry worldwide reports roughly $15 billion in revenue from recorded music, a financial Armageddon even if you consider that CDs are much more expensive to produce and distribute than digital tracks. With such a steep decline, how can the average songwriter or musician be doing better in the post-­Napster era? And why does there seem to be more musicians than ever?

Part of the answer is that the decline in recorded-­music revenue has been accompanied by an increase in revenues from live music. In 1999, when Britney Spears ruled the airwaves, the music business took in around $10 billion in live-­music revenue internationally; in 2014, live music generated almost $30 billion in revenue, according to data assembled from multiple sources by the live-music service Songkick. Starting in the early 1980s, average ticket prices for concerts closely followed the rise in overall consumer prices until the mid-1990s, when ticket prices suddenly took off: From 1997 to 2012, average ticket prices rose 150 percent, while consumer prices grew less than 100 percent. It’s elemental economics: As one good — recorded music — becomes ubiquitous, its price plummets, while another good that is by definition scarce (seeing a musician play a live performance) grows in value. Moreover, as file-­sharing and iTunes and Spotify have driven down the price of music, they have also made it far easier to envelop your life with a kind of permanent soundtrack, all of which drives awareness of the musicians and encourages fans to check them out in concert. Recorded music, then, becomes a kind of marketing expense for the main event of live shows.

It’s true that most of that live-­music revenue is captured by superstar acts like Taylor Swift or the Rolling Stones. In 1982, the musical 1-­percenters took in only 26 percent of the total revenues generated by live music; in 2003, they captured 56 percent of the market, with the top 5 percent of musicians capturing almost 90 percent of live revenues. But this winner-­takes-­all trend seems to have preceded the digital revolution; most 1-­percenters achieved their gains in the ’80s and early ’90s, as the concert business matured into a promotional machine oriented around marquee world tours. In the post-­Napster era, there seems to have been a swing back in a more egalitarian direction. According to one source, the top 100 tours of 2000 captured 90 percent of all revenue, while today the top 100 capture only 43 percent.

The growth of live music isn’t great news for the Brian Wilsons of the world, artists who would prefer to cloister themselves in the studio, endlessly tinkering with the recording process in pursuit of a masterpiece. The new economics of the post-­Napster era are certainly skewed toward artists who like to perform in public. But we should remember one other factor here that is often forgotten. The same technological forces that have driven down the price of recorded music have had a similar effect on the cost of making an album in the first place. We easily forget how expensive it was to produce and distribute albums in the pre-­Napster era. In a 2014 keynote speech at an Australian music conference, the indie producer and musician Steve Albini observed: ‘‘When I started playing in bands in the ’70s and ’80s, most bands went through their entire life cycle without so much as a note of their music ever being recorded.’’ Today, musicians can have software that emulates the sound of Abbey Road Studios on their laptops for a few thousand dollars. Distributing music around the world — a process that once required an immense global corporation or complex regional distribution deals — can now be performed by the artist herself while sitting in a Starbucks, simply through the act of uploading a file.

The vast machinery of promoters and shippers and manufacturers and A&R executives that sprouted in the middle of the 20th century, fueled by the profits of those high-­margin vinyl records and CDs, has largely withered away. What remains is a more direct relationship between the musicians and their fans. That new relationship has its own demands: the constant touring and self-­promotion, the Kickstarter campaigns that have raised $153 million dollars to date for music-­related projects, the drudgery that inevitably accompanies a life without handlers. But the economic trends suggest that the benefits are outweighing the costs. More people are choosing to make a career as a musician or a songwriter than they did in the glory days of Tower Records.

Of the big four creative industries (music, television, movies and books), music turns out to be the business that has seen the most conspicuous turmoil: None of the other three has seen anywhere near the cratering of recorded-­music revenues. The O.E.S. numbers show that writers and actors each saw their income increase by about 50 percent, well above the national average. According to the Association of American Publishers, total revenues in the fiction and nonfiction book industry were up 17 percent from 2008 to 2014, following the introduction of the Kindle in late 2007. Global television revenues have been projected to grow by 24 percent from 2012 to 2017. For actors and directors and screenwriters, the explosion of long-form television narratives has created a huge number of job opportunities. (Economic Modeling Specialists International reports that the number of self-­employed actors has grown by 45 percent since 2001.) If you were a television actor looking for work on a multiseason drama or comedy in 2001, there were only a handful of potential employers: the big four networks and HBO and Showtime. Today there are Netflix, Amazon, AMC, Syfy, FX and many others.

What about the economics of quality? Perhaps there are more musicians than ever, and the writers have collectively gotten a raise, but if the market is only rewarding bubble-­gum pop and ‘‘50 Shades Of Grey’’ sequels, there’s a problem. I think we can take it as a given that television is exempt from this concern: Shows like ‘‘Game Of Thrones,’’ ‘‘Orange Is The New Black,’’ ‘‘Breaking Bad’’ and so on confirm that we are living through a golden age of TV narrative. But are the other forms thriving artistically to the same degree?

Look at Hollywood, and at first blush the picture is deeply depressing. More than half of the highest grossing movies of 2014 were either superhero films or sequels; it’s clearly much harder to make a major-­studio movie today that doesn’t involve vampires, wizards or Marvel characters. This has led a number of commentators and filmmakers to publish eulogies for the classic midbudget picture. ‘‘Back in the 1980s and 1990s,’’ Jason Bailey wrote on Flavorwire, ‘‘it was possible to finance — either independently or via the studio system — midbudget films (anywhere from $5 million to $60 million) with an adult sensibility. But slowly, quietly, over roughly the decade and a half since the turn of the century, the paradigm shifted.’’ Movies like ‘‘Blue Velvet,’’ ‘‘Do the Right Thing’’ or ‘‘Pulp Fiction’’ that succeeded two or three decades ago, the story goes, would have had a much harder time in the current climate. Steven Soderbergh apparently felt so strongly about the shifting environment that he abandoned theatrical moviemaking altogether last year.

Is Bailey’s criticism really correct? If you make a great midbudget film in 2015, is the marketplace less likely to reward your efforts than it was 15 years ago? And has it become harder to make such a film? Cinematic quality is obviously more difficult to measure than profits or employment levels, but we can attempt an estimate of artistic achievement through the Rotten Tomatoes rankings, which aggregate critics’ reviews for movies. Based on my analysis, using data on box-­office receipts and budgets from IMDB, I looked at films from 1999 and 2013 that met three categories. First, they were original creations or adaptations, not based on existing franchises, and were intended largely for an adult audience; second, they had a budget below $80 million; and third, they were highly praised by the critics, as defined by their Rotten Tomatoes score — in other words, the best of the cinematic midlist. In 1999, the most highly rated films in these categories combined included ‘‘Three Kings,’’ ‘‘Being John Malkovich,’’ ‘‘American Beauty’’ and ‘‘Election.’’ The 2013 list included ‘‘12 Years a Slave,’’ ‘‘Her,’’ ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty,’’ ‘‘American Hustle’’ and ‘‘Nebraska.’’ In adjusted dollars, the class of 1999 brought in roughly $430 million at the box office. But the 2013 group took in about $20 million more. True, individual years can be misleading: All it takes is one monster hit to skew the numbers. But if you look at the blended average over a three-year window, there is still no evidence of decline. The 30 most highly rated midbudget films of 1999 to 2001 took in $1.5 billion at the domestic box office, adjusted for inflation; the class of 2011 to 2013 took in the exact same amount. Then as now, if you make a small or midsize movie that rates on the Top 10 lists of most critics, you’ll average roughly $50 million at the box office.

The critics are right that big Hollywood studios have abandoned the production of artistically challenging films, part of a broader trend since the 1990s of producing fewer films over all. (From 2006 to 2011, the combined output of major Hollywood studios declined by 25 percent.) And yet the total number of pictures released in the United States — nearly 600 in 2011 — remains high. A recent entertainment research report, The Sky Is Rising, notes that most of that growth has come from independent production companies, often financed by wealthy individuals from outside the traditional studio system. ‘‘Her,’’ ‘‘12 Years a Slave,’’ ‘‘Dallas Buyers Club,’’ ‘‘American Hustle’’ and ‘‘The Wolf of Wall Street’’ were all funded by major indies, though they usually relied on distribution deals with Hollywood studios. At the same time, of course, some of the slack in adventurous filmmaking has been taken up by the television networks. If Francis Ford Coppola were making his ‘‘Godfather’’ trilogy today, he might well end up at HBO or AMC, with a hundred hours of narrative at his disposal, instead of 10.

How have high-­quality books fared in the digital economy? If you write an exceptional novel or biography today, are you more or less likely to hit the best-­seller list than you might have in the pre-­Kindle age? Here the pessimists might have a case, based on my analysis. Every year, editors at The New York Times Book Review select the 100 notable books of the year. In 2004 and 2005, the years before the first Kindles were released, those books spent a combined 2,781 weeks on The Times’s best-­seller list and the American Booksellers Association’s IndieBound list, which tracks sales in independent bookstores. In 2013 and 2014, the notable books spent 2,531 weeks on the best-­seller lists — a decline of 9 percent. When you look at the two lists separately, the story becomes more complicated still. The critical successes of 2013 and 2014 actually spent 6 percent more weeks on the A.B.A. list, but 30 percent fewer weeks on the broader Times list. The numbers seem to suggest that the market for books may be evolving into two distinct systems. Critically successful works seem to be finding their audience more easily among indie-­bookstore shoppers, even as the mainstream market has been trending toward a winner-­takes-­all sweepstakes.

This would be even more troubling if independent bookstores — traditional champions of the literary novel and thoughtful nonfiction — were on life support. But contrary to all expectations, these stores have been thriving. After hitting a low in 2007, decimated not only by the Internet but also by the rise of big-box chains like Borders and Barnes & Noble, indie bookstores have been growing at a steady clip, with their number up 35 percent (from 1,651 in 2009 to 2,227 in 2015); by many reports, 2014 was their most financially successful year in recent memory. Indie bookstores account for only about 10 percent of overall book sales, but they have a vastly disproportionate impact on the sale of the creative midlist books that are so vital to the health of the culture.

How do we explain the evolutionary niche that indie bookstores seem to have found in recent years? It may be as simple as the tactile appeal of books and bookstores themselves. After several years of huge growth, e-book sales have plateaued over the past two years at 25 to 30 percent of the market, telegraphing that a healthy consumer appetite for print remains. To many of us, buying music in physical form is now simply an inconvenience: schlepping those CDs home and burning them and downloading the tracks to our mobile devices. But many of the most ardent Kindle converts — and I count myself among them — still enjoy browsing shelves of physical books, picking them up and sitting back on the couch with them. The trend might also reflect the social dimension of book culture: If you’re looking for literary community, you head out to the weekly reading series at the indie bookstore and buy something while you’re there. (Arguably, it’s the same phenomenon that happened with music, only with a twist. If you’re looking for musical community, you don’t go out on a CD-­buying binge. You go to a show instead.)

All these numbers, of course, only hint at whether our digital economy rewards quality. Or — even better than that milquetoast word ‘‘quality’’ — at whether it rewards experimentation, boundary-­pushing, satire, the real drivers of new creative work. It could be that our smartphone distractions and Kardashian celebrity culture have slowly but steadily lowered our critical standards, the aesthetic version of inflation: The critics might like certain films and books today because they’re surrounded by such a vast wasteland of mediocrity, but if you had released them 15 years ago, they would have paled beside the masterpieces of that era. But if you scan the titles, it is hard to see an obvious decline. A marketplace that rewarded ‘‘American Beauty,’’ ‘‘The Corrections’’ or ‘‘In the Heart of the Sea’’ doesn’t seem glaringly more sophisticated than one that rewards ‘‘12 Years a Slave,’’ ‘‘The Flamethrowers’’ or ‘‘The Sixth Extinction.’’

If you believe the data, then one question remains. Why have the more pessimistic predictions not come to pass? One incontrovertible reason is that — contrary to the justifiable fears of a decade ago — people will still pay for creative works. The Napsterization of culture turned out to be less of a threat to prices than it initially appeared. Consumers spend less for recorded music, but more for live. Most American households pay for television content, a revenue stream that for all practical purposes didn’t exist 40 years ago. Average movie-­ticket prices continue to rise. For interesting reasons, book piracy hasn’t taken off the way it did with music. And a whole new creative industry — video games — has arisen to become as lucrative as Hollywood. American households in 2013 spent 4.9 percent of their income on entertainment, the exact same percentage they spent in 2000.

At the same time, there are now more ways to buy creative work, thanks to the proliferation of content-­delivery platforms. Practically every device consumers own is tempting them at all hours with new films or songs or shows to purchase. Virtually no one bought anything on their computer just 20 years ago; the idea of using a phone to buy and read a 700-page book about a blind girl in occupied France would have sounded like a joke even 10 years ago. But today, our phones sell us every form of media imaginable; our TVs charge us for video-­on-­demand products; our car stereos urge us to sign up for SiriusXM.

And just as there are more avenues for consumers to pay for creative work, there are more ways to be compensated for making that work. Think of that signature flourish of 2000s-­era television artistry: the exquisitely curated (and usually obscure) song that signals the transition from final shot to the rolling credits. Having a track featured during the credits of ‘‘Girls’’ or ‘‘Breaking Bad’’ or ‘‘True Blood’’ can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to a songwriter. (Before that point, the idea of licensing a popular song for the credits of a television series was almost unheard-­of.) Video-­game budgets pay for actors, composers, writers and song licenses. There are YouTube videos generating ad revenue and Amazon Kindle Singles earning royalties, not to mention those emerging studios (like Netflix and Yahoo) that are spending significant dollars on high-­quality video. Filmmakers alone have raised more than $290 million on Kickstarter for their creations. Musicians are supplementing their income with instrument lessons on YouTube. All of these outlets are potential sources of revenue for the creative class, and all of them are creatures of the post-­Napster era. The Future of Music Coalition recently published a list of all the revenue streams available to musicians today, everything from sheet-­music sales at concerts to vinyl-­album sales. They came up with 46 distinct sources, 13 of which — including YouTube partner revenue and ringtone royalties — were nonexistent 15 years ago, and six of which, including film and television licensing, have greatly expanded in the digital age.

The biggest change of all, perhaps, is the ease with which art can be made and distributed. The cost of consuming culture may have declined, though not as much as we feared. But the cost of producing it has dropped far more drastically. Authors are writing and publishing novels to a global audience without ever requiring the service of a printing press or an international distributor. For indie filmmakers, a helicopter aerial shot that could cost tens of thousands of dollars a few years ago can now be filmed with a GoPro and a drone for under $1,000; some directors are shooting entire HD-­quality films on their iPhones. Apple’s editing software, Final Cut Pro X, costs $299 and has been used to edit Oscar-­winning films. A musician running software from Native Instruments can recreate, with astonishing fidelity, the sound of a Steinway grand piano played in a Vienna concert hall, or hundreds of different guitar-­amplifier sounds, or the Mellotron proto-­synthesizer that the Beatles used on ‘‘Strawberry Fields Forever.’’ These sounds could have cost millions to assemble 15 years ago; today, you can have all of them for a few thousand dollars.

From the bird’s-­eye perspective, it may not look as though all that much has changed in terms of the livelihoods of the creative class. On the whole, creators seem to be making slightly more money, while growing in number at a steady but not fast pace. I suspect the profound change lies at the boundaries of professionalism. It has never been easier to start making money from creative work, for your passion to undertake that critical leap from pure hobby to part-time income source. Write a novel or record an album, and you can get it online and available for purchase right away, without persuading an editor or an A&R executive that your work is commercially viable. From the consumer’s perspective, blurring the boundaries has an obvious benefit: It widens the pool of potential talent. But it also has an important social merit. Widening the pool means that more people are earning income by doing what they love.

These new careers — collaborating on an indie-­movie soundtrack with a musician across the Atlantic, uploading a music video to YouTube that you shot yourself on a smartphone — require a kind of entrepreneurial energy that some creators may lack. The new environment may well select for artists who are particularly adept at inventing new career paths rather than single-­mindedly focusing on their craft. There are certainly pockets of the creative world, like those critically acclaimed books dropping off the mainstream best-­seller lists, where the story is discouraging. And even the positive trends shouldn’t be interpreted as a mindless defense of the status quo. Most full-time artists barely make enough money to pay the bills, and so if we have levers to pull that will send more income their way — whether these take the form of government grants, Kickstarter campaigns or higher fees for the music we stream — by all means we should pull those levers.

But just because creative workers deserve to make more money, it doesn’t mean that the economic or technological trends are undermining their livelihoods. If anything, the trends are making creative livelihoods more achievable. Contrary to Lars Ulrich’s fear in 2000, the ‘‘diverse voices of the artists’’ are still with us, and they seem to be multiplying. The song remains the same, and there are more of us singing it for a living.",REAL
Why New Orleans’s Black Residents Are Still Underwater After Katrina,"You could say Alden McDonald triumphed over adversity, too. Today he runs the country’s third-largest black-owned bank, according to the Federal Reserve. But despite his personal success, McDonald is still focused on the eastern half of that map that he marked up at our first meeting. There, the recovery is far from complete — and in some areas things are worse than before the storm. In this frustration, he represents what might be called the black Katrina narrative, a counterpoint to the jubilant accounts of Landrieu and other New Orleans boosters. This version of the story begins by noting that an African-American homeowner was more than three times more likely than a white one to live in a flooded part of town. Where Landrieu sees black and white coming together, many African-Americans recollect a different New Orleans: rifle-carrying sheriffs and police officers barricading a bridge out of an overwhelmed city because they didn’t want the largely black crowds walking through their predominantly white suburbs; a white congressman overheard saying that God had finally accomplished what others couldn’t by clearing out public housing; a prominent resident from the Uptown part of the city telling a Wall Street Journal reporter that in rebuilding, things would be ‘‘done in a completely different way, demographically, geographically and politically’’ — or he and his friends weren’t moving back.

Now there are still 100,000 fewer black residents living in New Orleans than at the time of Katrina. McDonald estimates that one-third of his friends have not returned, because their homes were destroyed. ‘‘I still have family members stuck in Houston, some cousins,’’ McDonald says. ‘‘They’re terribly homesick.’’ Only about 80 percent of the residents of New Orleans East, where a good portion of the city’s African-American middle class as well as a large share of the city’s black elite lived, have returned. In the Seventh Ward, he says, where he grew up, only about half of the homes are restored a decade after Katrina. ‘‘There was never a plan to bring people back home,’’ he says. ‘‘There was never a plan of any kind.’’

The Seventh Ward, for most of McDonald’s life, has been a working-class enclave filled with the city’s barbers, waiters and factory workers. McDonald grew up in a two-bedroom shotgun house that needed to accommodate a family of seven, and at times McDonald’s grandparents, who lived with the family on and off throughout much of his childhood, or the stray friend one of his sisters occasionally brought home.

McDonald’s parents slept in the front bedroom. The back bedroom had a pair of bunk beds for McDonald, the oldest of five siblings, and his two brothers. There was also a pullout couch for the grandparents. His two sisters slept on another sofa bed in the living room. When the whole family was there, nine people shared a single bathroom. ‘‘We came up hard,’’ the family’s middle son, Byron, says.

McDonald’s father worked at the Boston Club, an exclusive whites-only redoubt at the time, whose sole identifying sign outside was a B etched on its frosted-glass door on Canal Street. During a 52-year career, Alden McDonald Sr. rose to the position of headwaiter. He worked lunch, the cocktail hour and dinner and often stayed late for the private parties, including for Rex, the secretive Mardi Gras krewe made up of members of the city’s white upper class. His father was highly regarded, McDonald said, but he never made more than $15,000 a year including tips, and the job had neither health insurance nor retirement benefits. Anyone in the family who fell sick saw a doctor at Charity Hospital.

McDonald’s mother, Celestine, devised any number of ways to bring extra money into the house. She sold burial insurance to neighbors and hired herself out as a kind of community taxi service in the family station wagon and later in a van she bought to accommodate her growing business, carting old people around on their errands; she added extra pickups in the morning when taking her own children to school. She made and sold pickles and candy and, in the warmer months, sold a frozen sugary concoction the kids called huckabuck.

A couple of McDonald’s uncles were bricklayers with their own company. By the time they were 10 or 11, the McDonald boys worked ‘‘the pile,’’ as Byron put it, cleaning and sorting bricks, mixing mortar, dragging cinder blocks. All three of them also helped their father when he worked weekend parties at the houses of wealthy whites. But the eldest son, Alden, stood apart as an entrepreneur. One Christmas, he persuaded his younger siblings to agree to accept a movie projector as their sole gift that year. He draped a white sheet over a clothesline in the empty lot next door, charged kids a nickel to enter and sold popcorn and lemonade at a concession stand he set up. He split the take with his siblings, who, as co-owners of the projector, were his business partners. ‘‘He always took care of us that way,’’ Byron says. ‘‘He was a good older brother.’’

McDonald assumed he would be a bricklayer after high school. His uncles had done well for themselves in that line of work; another bricklayer was among the first in the neighborhood to have a television. At his parents’ behest, though, he gave college a try, matriculating first at Xavier University, a historically black college near the center of town, and then Loyola, across the street from Tulane in Uptown New Orleans. But he and a childhood friend worked as exterminators right after graduating from high school, and that consumed ever more of his time. ‘‘I was always more interested in making money than books,’’ McDonald says. After only a few semesters, he dropped out of Loyola and signed up to study accounting and other more practical skills at a local trade school.

His father’s Boston Club connections led to his big break. Working at a private party Uptown, the senior McDonald was approached by a guest who was starting a new bank in town. The man sought to hire several industrious young black men or women, which is how the 23-year-old McDonald became, in 1966, one of the first black bankers in New Orleans history. By 28, he was a vice president, sent by his bosses to help right underperforming departments. He was a black man working in a pedigreed, almost all-white industry, but the bank’s president, McDonald says, made sure he never had a problem. ‘‘He’d call a department head into his office and say: ‘Alden is being brought in to clean up. So whatever he tells you to do, you’ll do.’ ’’

When McDonald was 29, shortly after he started dating Rhesa Ortique, a public-school teacher who would soon become his wife, a group of white and black investors put up $2 million to start the city’s first minority-owned bank. Norman Francis, the president of Xavier University and the chairman of the group, asked McDonald to run the start-up. He said no. ‘‘I think Alden was genuinely scared that he wasn’t ready,’’ says Rhesa, whose mother also taught in the New Orleans schools and whose father was Louisiana’s first black State Supreme Court justice. Francis tried again. ‘‘You can be part of history, Alden,’’ he told him. Again McDonald said no. He said yes the third time only because Francis practically made it sound as if the future of black New Orleans depended on him. Thirty days before opening its doors, in 1972, Liberty named Alden J. McDonald Jr. its president.

Its first branch was a trailer set up on an empty lot in a run-down part of town a few minutes from the central business district. ‘‘This bank represents freedom of our community,’’ McDonald said when it was his turn to talk at the bank’s opening ceremony. ‘‘A light shining the way for a better New Orleans.’’ They would accelerate black homeownership, McDonald and other speakers said, and provide the essential seed funding to would-be shopkeepers, restaurant owners and other entrepreneurs in the black community. Two thousand people opened accounts at Liberty that first day. ‘‘Liberty would become this test of black consciousness in the community,’’ says Jacques Morial, the son of Ernest Morial, an original Liberty investor and the city’s first black mayor, and the brother of Marc Morial, the city’s third black mayor.

But mortgages and commercial loans would have to wait at a bank with only $2 million in cash. Instead, McDonald started where he knew the need was great: fairly priced consumer loans for things like refrigerators, bedroom sets and home repairs. Because there were so few banks in black neighborhoods, so-called hard moneylenders like Household Finance and Beneficial could charge annual interest rates around 18 percent on loans. McDonald said he believed that he could offer cheaper loans and still be profitable by creating a loan process that depended on more than just credit scores. ‘‘We want to hear that person’s story and judge eye to eye if we think they’re going to pay us back,’’ McDonald says. He offered consumer loans at around 6 percent to the same working-class families who had been going to Household Finance and Beneficial.

Once a week, the staff stayed late to work on delinquent accounts. ‘‘Even if someone is willing to pay you just $10 or $20 a month, that shows a commitment,’’ McDonald told his staff. That’s not to say McDonald was a soft touch. One evening a customer told McDonald on the phone that he had no intention of paying his car loan and then hung up. McDonald had one of his employees call the New Orleans police officer they kept on retainer for repossessions and then rode with him and an employee, Ronnie Burns, in search of the car. ‘‘It’s like midnight when we find it,’’ recalls Burns, who today sits on Liberty’s board of directors. The off-duty cop jumped out brandishing a shotgun while another Liberty employee jimmied his way into the customer’s car and drove it back to Liberty. ‘‘I’d go along just to make sure no one does something stupid,’’ McDonald says, but Burns says he thinks McDonald was, perhaps, also out for a bit of justice. ‘‘Alden worked hard each and every day,’’ Burns says, ‘‘and he expected the people we did business with to do the same.’’

Most of Liberty’s customers lived in New Orleans East. The area had been swampland before developers realized its moneymaking potential in the 1960s and started draining it to make room for tracts of homes. Its first residents were mainly white, but McDonald was among those African-Americans who began moving to the area at the start of the 1970s. New Orleans East flourished. A reporter for The New Orleans States-Item, the city’s now-defunct afternoon paper, wrote in 1979 about a ‘‘unique, racially integrated enclave of middle-class homes ... almost unnoticed by the rest of the city.’’

Eventually, other banks opened in the eastern half of the city. But Liberty still played a vital role for customers who did not feel welcomed by a mainstream lender. ‘‘Before Alden McDonald, it was hard to even get a conversation with a banker,’’ says Leah Chase, the chef and co-owner of Dooky Chase’s. In 1982, she says, she borrowed around $120,000 from Liberty to expand; her restaurant has since hosted Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

When oil prices crashed in the mid-1980s, many of those who worked on the oil rigs off the Louisiana coast were affected. People lost jobs, homes were taken through foreclosure and banks around the state went out of business. Liberty posted its first-ever loss in 1987, and then its second and third in 1988 and 1989. Yet McDonald also saw opportunity in hard economic times. The steep fall in home prices made it possible for a wider range of people who still had jobs to afford the monthly payment on a home loan. But many of them did not make enough to be able save up for a down payment, so Liberty offered to make loans for down payments at as low as 3 percent. ‘‘Alden would scare me sometimes, but he understood the need for us to take risks more than I did,’’ Francis says. ‘‘Not willy-nilly risks, but the risks that would let the bank serve its core function helping the black community grow.’’ Liberty’s program proved so effective at increasing black homeownership that officials from Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage company, brought McDonald to Washington so they could learn from his experience.

Over the next decade, New Orleans East started to change. When the ratio of black-to-white households in a subdivision hit roughly 50-50, McDonald and others say, the white residents started to move away. There still remained black lawyers and accountants and junior executives commuting each morning to downtown office towers, but by the late 1990s, the East was a black community, and a prosperous African-American community is not always perceived the same way as a prosperous white one. The Plaza, the area’s upscale mall, became a dumping ground for clothes and other merchandise department stores couldn’t sell at their other outlets. Landlords started renting units to federally subsidized, low-income Section 8 tenants. Check cashers, payday lenders and dollar stores followed. The nice wine shop shut its doors. Eventually, an area with nearly 100,000 residents was without a single white-tablecloth restaurant. ‘‘No one would invest out here,’’ McDonald says.

On Wednesday nights in the early 2000s, local residents gathered in a Liberty Bank conference room to talk about fighting back against the decline. McDonald thought his role would be that of host, but he often ended up playing ambassador. He would meet with businesses to try to attract them to the East, armed with a study funded by the bank showing that there was more discretionary income in the East than any place outside Uptown. (Another Liberty-funded study revealed the challenge he faced: The area was home to 40 percent of the city’s Section 8 housing.) ‘‘We were very close to getting some national restaurants out there,’’ McDonald says. ‘‘Then Katrina hit.’’

McDonald escaped to Atlanta ahead of Hurricane Katrina. It was there, at the home of family friends, that he saw the first images of New Orleans after the levees failed — people stranded on rooftops and elevated highways, entire neighborhoods under water. The news didn’t mention New Orleans East, but the longer McDonald watched, the more he felt his business was doomed. Liberty had lent tens of millions of dollars to homeowners and entrepreneurs in the East, and now their properties were probably sitting in four to six feet of water, if not more.

‘‘I’m wiped out,’’ McDonald told himself.

Two days after New Orleans started to flood, McDonald flew from Atlanta to the modest bank branch in Baton Rouge where crucial personnel had long planned to meet in the event of a disaster. The bank’s loan department now consisted of two people sitting in mismatched chairs at a folding table. Next to them sat another person assigned to figure out which Liberty borrowers carried flood insurance and which did not. McDonald himself worked at a small table in the conference room. He was a man in perpet­ual motion, bouncing among the main room, the branch lobby and his own office. He had two cellphones, and it was not uncommon for one to ring while he was already talking on the other.

Regulators working for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were constantly checking on Liberty, asking about its reserves and its recovery plans. State banking officials were also a presence in those early months. ‘‘Regulators were worried about the whole system in New Orleans collapsing,’’ McDonald told me. ‘‘But I think it’s fair to say they were more worried about me than anyone else.’’

Right after the flooding, McDonald imposed a $100 daily limit on all A.T.M. withdrawals. Until Liberty was reconnected to the global banking network, he and his colleagues could have no idea how much money each customer had in his or her account. But imagining his customers camping out in hotels around the country, racking up expenses, he increased the daily maximum withdrawal to $500 and hoped they had the money to cover the withdrawn cash. He was intent on playing Jimmy Stewart’s George Bailey in ‘‘It’s a Wonderful Life’’ and not Lionel Barrymore’s Mr. Potter. ‘‘A banker is someone who gives you an umbrella when the sun is shining and takes it away when it starts to rain,’’ McDonald says, repeating an unflattering adage about his profession. ‘‘We try not be that banker.’’ That decision cost Liberty roughly $1 million in payouts to people who didn’t have the money to cover their withdrawals.

That was small compared with the bank’s other losses. McDonald offered a four-month, no-questions-asked grace period on any loan for a home, business or auto in a flooded area. (Fannie Mae advised banks to offer moratoriums of ‘‘up to three months.’’) That represented millions of dollars in checks the bank wouldn’t be cashing in the weeks ahead. And once Jan. 1, 2006, came, then what? Eighty percent of his customers lived in the flood zone. Could he expect most people to resume payments on homes, cars and businesses that had been destroyed by water? Liberty deferred interest charges on credit-card balances, which meant more lost revenue, and for months they didn’t collect loan fees, late charges or other payments that banks levy to boost profits on loans. ‘‘Everywhere I look,’’ McDonald said six weeks after the storm, ‘‘I’m losing money.’’

Liberty had to contend with the damage to its own banks as well. It hired an outside crew to gut and clean its water-damaged properties, but the job of sifting through waterlogged file cabinets, folder by folder, looking for any surviving paperwork, fell to bank employees wearing protective gear. Good news came one day when the mortgage department announced that only seven homeowners living in the flood zone had allowed their flood insurance to lapse before the hurricane. The Liberty staff cheered, but McDonald reminded them, ‘‘Now the question will be, did they have enough coverage?’’ He instructed his staff to request copies of the insurance policies their customers carried and then coach property owners on what they needed to say to their insurers. If the initial offer from an insurer was too low, someone from the bank would walk a loan customer through the appeals process. The bigger the settlement check, the less likely the bank would take a loss on a loan.

But every day, longtime customers were closing accounts because they were now living nowhere close to a Liberty A.T.M. McDonald anticipated losing thousands more. He began showing up at conferences and other events that focused on socially responsible investments to try and raise money for the bank. ‘‘He was everywhere afterward, pushing Liberty as the community bank in New Orleans in the middle of this disaster,’’ says William Michael Cunningham, a black economist and the founder of Creative Investment Research, who had been attending such gatherings for decades. McDonald was promoting new certificates of deposit he called Katrina Investment Deposits, or KIDs. These were C.D.s offering a below-market interest rate that promised to help out a cash-starved bank; they raised $10 million. Liberty used the money to make loans without down payments available to homeowners seeking to rebuild.

McDonald approached Walmart and other big-box retailers to discuss putting banking centers in their stores and considered opening loan centers in strip malls — storefronts that would make the kind of small-denomination loans that were Liberty’s specialty at its inception. He also considered expanding into other parts of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. ‘‘If we were going to survive,’’ says Ronnie Burns, the Liberty board member, ‘‘Alden was going to have to rebuild this thing brick by brick.’’

Seven months after Katrina, as McDonald drove me around his New Orleans in a tan minivan, the East was still barren. A new federal program called Road Home had just been announced. Publicized as the largest housing-recovery program in the country’s history — it would eventually grow to more than $10 billion — it promised to pay out as much as $150,000 to homeowners who had flood damage, depending on the size of their losses.

But McDonald had already diagnosed Road Home’s racial bias: Compensation would be based not on the actual cost of rebuilding, but on the appraised value of a property. The cost of restoring a 2,000-square-foot house in mostly white Lake­view, just west of City Park, or Gentilly, a black middle-class neighborhood to its east, would be the same — but the Road Home payment would differ. In Lakeview, that home was valued at a little over $300,000. A Lakeview couple who received a $150,000 flood insurance payment would receive the full $150,000 from Road Home. But in Gentilly, a similar home was valued at closer to $160,000. If a Gentilly couple received a flood insurance check of $150,000, they would receive only $10,000 from Road Home. It wasn’t just the poor, McDonald understood early on, who would have trouble rebuilding, but also middle-class people who didn’t have the savings or family wealth to make up the shortfall and fix their homes.

‘‘If we use pre-Katrina assessments for compensating people, nobody in the black community is coming out anywhere near whole,’’ McDonald said at the time. By the time a federal judge reached the same conclusion, nearly five years later, it would be largely too late. All but $148 million of the original $10 billion had already been spent. (The federal government agreed to set aside another $500 million specifically to help homeowners shortchanged by Road Home.)

McDonald was also frustrated by the response to a 17-member panel he sat on created by Mayor Ray Nagin shortly after Katrina to develop a plan for rebuilding the city. In addition, dozens of out-of-town experts descended on New Orleans 10 weeks after Katrina to help. McDonald ‘‘holed up in a hotel room with all these brilliant minds,’’ he recalls, to discuss an idea he had for resurrecting Pontchartrain Park, a once-grand middle-class black community devastated by the flooding. The residents of Pontchartrain Park tended to be older African-Americans. What if the city used a small share of its redevelopment dollars to build a senior center there and attract a dialysis center, a grocery store within walking distance and other amenities appealing to older people? Many still would be unable to return, but McDonald, working with planners and other experts, devised a land bank that would allow someone in another part of the city to swap a ruined home for a similar-size renovated house in Pontchartrain, in that way providing an incentive for people to cluster together and recreate a community. That idea, along with others, was submitted to the mayor. But another member of the panel recommended that the city temporarily ban rebuilding in its lowest-lying parts while officials made up their minds about whether to reinvest in neighborhoods that were in harm’s way. This idea infuriated those eager to start work on their homes. Nagin, with an election only a few months off, did not want to step into this controversy and simply thanked his commission for its hard work and then ignored its suggestions, as if every proposal were tainted by the proposed temporary ban.

McDonald himself was still undecided about moving back to the East. He split time between his family in Baton Rouge and an R.V. he had bought and parked behind his restored New Orleans headquarters. Three years passed before the McDonalds came back to the city; they would be among the first of their friends to do so.

Brick by brick, McDonald began rebuilding his bank. He hired consultants to teach him how to take advantage of federal programs that gave big tax breaks on investments in low- and moderate-income communities. He had fewer customers in New Orleans now, so he needed to look outside the city to replace lost business. The bank bought mortgage companies in Baton Rouge and Houston and purchased land in Jackson, Miss., to build a branch there.

The subprime-mortgage crisis hit a few years after Katrina. But this blow to the global banking system proved another opportunity for McDonald and Liberty. It had subprime customers — those with low credit scores — but, McDonald said, ‘‘we were always careful to put them into loans they could afford.’’ By 2008, when much larger institutions needed bailouts, Liberty was turning a profit. Those same regulators who after Katrina were worried about Liberty now came to McDonald as a potential buyer for other troubled black-owned banks, including one with three branches in Kansas City, Mo. McDonald bought that bank, along with others in Chicago and Detroit. By 2010, Liberty was operating 24 branches in six states.

Since then, Liberty has acquired other distressed black-owned banks in Chicago and Alabama. McDonald now finds himself confronting a new, enviable worry: slowing down the pace of growth so that his bank doesn’t cross the $1 billion threshold. If it does, it would have to submit to more rigorous regulatory exams. ‘‘I’m too old for that,’’ he says. At the same time, he has watched enviously as the big chains and other businesses flocked to Lakeview, but not New Orleans East and certainly not the more modest parts of black New Orleans. In 2011, The Times-Picayune ran an article about the revitalization of Lakeview and noted the lack of commercial vacancies there. At the time, McDonald pointed out a trio of strip malls on or around Lake Forest Boulevard, near his office. ‘‘All of them 100 percent occupied pre-Katrina,’’ he said. All three were now vacant. McDonald worked to rebuild the eastern half of the city. But wherever he looked, it cost much more to rebuild a house than what the house was worth. The bank created a $20 million loan fund, which Liberty called its Gentilly Homeowner Initiative. One early applicant, McDonald told me, was a family of four confined to a couple of rooms because they needed another $80,000 to finish fixing the rest of their house. Both parents worked service-industry jobs and didn’t make enough to justify a loan half that size. Acting more as a social worker than banker, a Liberty loan agent linked them to a nonprofit that could supply free labor and then wrote them a loan for the cost of materials.

Yet there is only so much a single for-profit entity can do. In recent years, Liberty tried making loans in the Lower Ninth Ward. McDonald’s employees needed to be just as hands-on there. Contractor fraud was rampant then, especially in lower-income communities, and Liberty’s staff, as it did elsewhere in the city, would offer lists of recommended contractors and monitor their progress to make sure the work was being done. But only a small fraction of potential borrowers qualified for even a modest loan — before Katrina, the typical resident of that neighborhood had been living on $16,000. Ten years after Katrina, only 36 percent of the Lower Ninth Ward’s population has returned, according to the New Orleans Data Center.

Today the New Orleans City Council is again majority black. The city again has a black police chief. McDonald is wealthy. All three of his children are grown up and accomplished. He’s a grandfather several times over. Yet he’s thriving despite New Orleans, not because of it. His life’s mission has been to improve black New Orleans, but his outlook on his half of the city is gloomy, McDonald told me in the winter, as we sat in the boardroom on the top floor of Liberty’s six-story headquarters. Rents have soared since Katrina; home prices in some historically black neighborhoods have doubled — because of gentrification, because of lack of supply and because of the high cost of building — pricing out those black families who still harbored hopes of returning home. Property taxes have doubled, too, and flood-insurance rates have tripled. Water bills will more than double by 2020 to pay for much-needed repairs to the city’s water and sewer system. Meanwhile, many of New Orleans’s service employees are still earning close to minimum wage.

The walls of Liberty’s boardroom were decorated with original artwork by Jacob Lawrence, Elizabeth Catlett and other renowned African-American artists. The views from its high perch were limitless. Yet looking out the window facing east meant staring at a stretch of emptiness that once was the great Plaza mall. While much of New Orleans thrived, McDonald said he saw little hope of a better future for many of his customers. ‘‘The poor will stay poor and the middle class can never get ahead,’’ he said, revealing a rare flash of anger. He paused and added a phrase I don’t imagine he has used many times in his life: ‘‘And I don’t have the solution.’’",REAL
Baseball’s Last Cuban Escapees,"The first high-profile wave of defectors arrived in the United States in the early 1990s, and after their success — Liván Hernández became a World Series M.V.P., Rey Ordóñez won three straight Gold Gloves — more Cubans followed. Many used international tournaments as escape hatches: They would walk out of a team hotel in Miami or scale a fence in Buffalo, then take refuge with an American cousin or aunt. Just last month, two Cuban players defected after an exhibition game in North Carolina. Escape, however, was often its own form of punishment. Most defectors had to leave without even saying goodbye to their families; the few who received official permission to come to the United States had to leave everything behind. This meant that Cuban players entered the high-pressure world of Major League Baseball in terrible isolation. Great talents, after all that risk, found themselves struggling with loneliness, guilt, post-traumatic stress disorder and the dangers of sudden wealth and fame. Eventually, many of them fizzled out.

Yasiel Puig, the All-Star right fielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers, tried and failed to leave at least four times before he finally succeeded. Puig hiked for 30 hours, slogged through a crocodile-infested swamp to avoid the police and ended up a prisoner in a Cancún hotel room while rival underworld figures tried to extract money from one another. Even then, his ordeal wasn’t over. When Puig signed a $42 million major-league contract, he had to pay out a portion of it to the smugglers who had helped to extract him. (It seems fitting that Puig’s fantastical story has been optioned for film by the director of one of the X-Men movies.) After dominating the league during his rookie year, Puig suddenly regressed, spending much of this season on the bench.

The United States’ recent decision to normalize relations with Cuba should, among all its other geopolitical effects, signal the end of this strange cloak-and-dagger era in baseball migration. The next generation of prospects will be greeted not as fugitives but as normal international rookies. This introduction of safety and legality — admirable, necessary, humane — will also nevertheless signal the end of a long tradition of Cuban mystery and romance: the whispered legends that would build around a prospect long before he actually appeared in the flesh, the excitement of his sudden arrival, and then — if we were lucky — the display of exorbitant talent that seemed to push the limits of the sport. Cuban stars have often been flamboyant, demonstrative and a little wild — from the acrobatics of Ordóñez to the time Orlando Hernández, known as El Duque, threw his entire glove to first base to everything having to do with Puig, including his signature celebratory bat flip. (One of Puig’s nicknames is ‘‘The Wild Horse.’’) In the newly regulated future, Cuban players may become, for better and worse, a little more ordinary. They may also become a little less wealthy: Initial salaries, instead of being driven up and up by bids in the open market, will start on Major League Baseball’s much lower rookie scale. $42 million could turn into just above $500,000.

These players belong to what is very likely the last generation of Cuban athletes who will have to endure such outrageous hardships to get here. The group contains steady veterans, rising superstars and young prospects. The portraits were taken during spring training in Arizona, where much of the league gathered to loosen up and celebrate the thawing of the continent. Cuban players had a little extra to celebrate: not only the usual optimism of a fresh season but also the dawn of a potentially radical new era, one in which the road home may not be quite so obstructed, and in which more of their countrymen will be joining them — safely, normally — soon.",REAL
The Unwelcome Return of ‘Illegals’,"Photo

Ten years ago, the political strategist Frank Luntz issued a proclamation about the language of immigration. ‘‘Always refer to people crossing the border illegally as ‘illegal immigrants’ — NOT as ‘illegals,’ ’’ Luntz instructed fellow conservatives. ‘‘Illegals’’ sounds harsh and spiky. As with ‘‘fatties’’ in high school, or ‘‘thugs,’’ it’s a way to write off a group and justify its mistreatment. Luntz says his research showed that ‘‘if you used the word ‘illegals,’ you didn’t get a chance to say anything else — Latino audiences would turn you off.’’ Republicans have long respected Luntz’s messaging skills: This is the man who helped them write the Contract With America and pioneer the phrase ‘‘death tax.’’ Yet G.O.P. candidates for president have repeatedly ignored his warning.

The slight has become a primary-season refrain, brandished like a conservative calling card. ‘‘We need to keep illegals out,’’ Donald Trump said at the Republican presidential debate earlier this month after being reminded of his earlier claims that Mexico is sending rapists and other criminals across the border. The Fox News anchor Chris Wallace picked up the term in a question, and Mike Huckabee volleyed it back, claiming that the solvency of Social Security and Medicare was under threat from ‘‘illegals, prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, all the people that are freeloading off the system now.’’ In 2007, Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani deployed ‘‘illegals’’ while debating the rights of undocumented workers, and Romney and Rick Perry used it four years later while tangling over who was mowing Romney’s lawn. ‘‘I’m running for office, for Pete’s sake, I can’t have illegals,’’ Romney sputtered.

The more common phrase, ‘‘illegal immigrant,’’ also implies suspicion, but strip the noun from it and the entire identity of a person who crosses the border without permission, or outstays his or her visa, is reduced to that of a criminal: What rights could he or she be entitled to? ‘‘Illegals’’ becomes the noun, the insult and the dismissal. Designating immigrants as ‘‘illegals’’ also makes it easier not to see the frequent lawbreaking of employers who provide meager pay and unsafe working conditions. And ‘‘illegals’’ implies a permanent caste, as if there is no possibility of becoming anything else — even if millions of immigrants in the course of American history have shown otherwise.

In the United States, the idea of the unwanted ‘‘illegal’’ immigrant arose in the last century. ‘‘It dates to the 1924 Immigration Act, when the United States solidified a quota system for immigration, which was explicitly racial,’’ the Yale historian Stephen Pitti told me. ‘‘The quotas were based on the census of 1890 to favor immigrants from Northern Europe.’’ Asians were excluded. Eastern Europeans and Russians (read: Jews) were strictly limited. At the time, however, immigrants from Latin America were exempt from the quotas, to keep a supply of cheap labor flowing to the agribusinesses of the Southwest. As the population of Spanish speakers along the border grew, so did restrictionist sentiment. ‘‘There was an escalation of fear-mongering language,’’ Pitti said. ‘‘ ‘Illegals’ were stealing jobs, and they were also responsible for a drug epidemic, for bringing in marijuana, for sexual depravity.’’

In 1954, the country’s first large-scale deportations began, with military planes and buses swooping into border settlements and cities. It was called Operation Wetback, a derogatory term for people who cross the Rio Grande from Mexico. The official use of ‘‘wetback’’ seems bizarre now, but it was a mainstream term within government for decades. Conservatives like to point out that even the labor leader Cesar Chavez used ‘‘wetbacks,’’ along with ‘‘illegals,’’ in a burst of frustration over strikebreaking in 1972, when undocumented immigrants were brought by employers across the border to thwart unionizers. Plenty of the workers Chavez was trying to organize were also in the country illegally, says Pitti, who is writing a biography of him. Nonetheless, Chavez reportedly supported a government plan to deport a million undocumented immigrants in 1974, making his opposition clear only after a backlash in the Chicano community.

Immigration policy and language have been twin minefields for many decades. The linguistic challenge may now be greater for Republicans, but the parties don’t neatly divide between immigration hawks and doves. It was President Obama whom the head of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights group, labeled ‘‘deporter in chief’’ last year. Before Obama proposed work permits and deportation deferrals for about five million undocumented immigrants (out of an estimated 11 million), his administration presided over a record number of deportations.",REAL
Shadows in São Paulo,"In Magnum’s New York office, there’s a library print of ‘‘Men on a Rooftop.’’ On the reverse of the picture are stamps and scribbles: Burri’s name, the words ‘‘Brazil’’ and ‘‘businessmen’’ and several five-digit numbers in different hands. It was a lovely artifact, but it told me nothing about exactly where in the city the picture had been made. Nor did an interview Burri gave late in life, in which he simply said, ‘‘Whenever there was a high-rise building, I was climbing up and knocked at the door and said, ‘Can I take a picture?’ ’’ São Paulo is full of high-rises, and they all have doors. I tried a few. The view from the roof of the sinuous 38-floor Oscar Niemeyer-designed Copan building yielded no clues. The restaurant near the top of the 46-floor Edifício Itália offered a thrilling panorama, but I saw nothing that related to Burri’s photograph.

There had been a terrible drought at the beginning of the year, but it was finally raining in São Paulo. I sat in my hotel room, brooding. During a brief lull in the downpour, a woman dressed in black and wearing high heels walked across the roof of the building across the street, smoking a cigarette.

Photo

Four days into my trip, Thyago emailed with news. A friend of his thought that Burri’s picture was made from the top of a building that once belonged to the Bank of the State of São Paulo. That building, still informally called the Banespão, was completed in 1947, and was for a while the tallest in Brazil. I went up with a small group of tourists. It was midmorning, the rain had stopped; we were limited to five minutes. From the viewing platform, 36 floors above the sprawling city, the vista was bright. I took photos in all directions and realized, with a sinking feeling, that I was again in the wrong place. Then the five minutes were up, and our small group had to descend.

A dead end. I wrote to thank Thyago anyway, and I asked other friends in the city about Burri’s picture, but few of them knew it. The search had begun to take on some of the dream logic of the photograph itself. I was frustrated but also vaguely amused, as though I were suspended in the first half of an uncompleted joke. I asked the concierge. I asked the taxi drivers who took me around. None of them could recognize the photograph. It seemed that I would leave São Paulo empty-handed. In any case, the city had grown so fast and so quickly: Perhaps the building the men walked on, or the one from which Burri took his picture, had been altered or demolished.

Then Thyago wrote back. His friend, he said, insisted that it had to be the Banespão. It could be no other. But I’d seen the view with my own eyes. What had I missed? It was a Friday, the day before the end of my vacation. And that was when I remembered a curious story that Burri told about the photograph. In those days, according to Burri, Henri Cartier-­Bresson, a founder of Magnum Photos, limited his fellow photographers to lenses from 35 millimeters to 90 millimeters. Burri had surreptitiously gone longer while shooting in São Paulo, to 180 millimeters. ‘‘I never told him!’’ he said. ‘‘At that point, I broke loose from my mentor.’’ When you shoot at such an extended focal length, there’s a great deal more compression between the middle and far distances. The canyons created by São Paulo’s high-rises seem even more vertiginous. The angle of view is also severely narrowed, cutting out much of what the eye sees on the periphery of vision. Perhaps using the wrong lens was getting in my way? I’d taken a 50-millimeter lens with me. I now borrowed a longer lens from Thyago; it was only 85 millimeters, not ideal, but closer. Then I got in a taxi and went to the Banespão.

It was late afternoon, and by now the rains were torrential. The city was a gray blur. The buildings shone with wet. The time limit at the top of the building was the same as before, five minutes, and in the open-air viewing platform, I got drenched. I set my eye to the camera’s viewfinder and looked northwest. Suddenly, everything clicked into place, as in the final moves of a jigsaw. I saw Burri’s view. To the right was the building the men had walked on. How could I have missed it before? It was (I later discovered) the Edifício do Banco do Brasil. What I hadn’t seen in Burri’s photo was that the ‘‘roof’’ the men were walking on was not the building’s summit: The building had a stacked design, and a further set of floors rose just out of the shot. To my left and far below, meanwhile, was Avenida São João, slightly changed from 1960 — the tram lines were gone — but certainly recognizable in its rain-slicked state. The avenue was full of cars, buses and pedestrians. The rain kept coming down, and my five minutes were up. But the mission had been accomplished.

‘‘The photograph isn’t what was photog­raphed, it’s something else,’’ Garry Winogrand once said. ‘‘It’s about transformation.’’ The photographic image is a fiction created by a combination of lenses, cameras, film, pixels, color (or its absence), time of day, season. When I’m moved by something, I want to literally put myself in its place, the better to understand what was transformed. This interests me as a writer and as a photographer: how do raw materials become something else, something worth keeping? ‘‘Those four guys just came from nowhere, and went to nowhere,’’ Burri said of the men in his photograph. The photograph he made of them came from nowhere and went everywhere. My seeing his point of view and taking a picture from the same spot 55 years later did not solve the mystery. But in discovering all that can be known about a work of art, what cannot be known is honored even more. We come right up to the edge, and can go no farther.",REAL
Kevyn Aucoin’s ‘Making Faces’,"Photo

I was 14 when I discovered I have an oval face. I learned this from reading Kevyn Aucoin’s ‘‘Making Faces,’’ a glossy volume published in 1997 that quickly became a kind of sacred text among teenage girls. We all trekked to the Borders at Winrock mall in Albuquerque to buy a copy, using the savings we had built up by babysitting or halfheartedly frothing lattes for minimum wage. We lugged the book home (all 160 oversize pages of it) to commune in private with its thick, creamy paperstock full of wisdom about lip shapes, brow bleaching and false eyelashes. We propped it against the bathroom sink as we mashed our fingers into our cheekbones, feeling for deep bone structure. We pored over close-ups of celebrity pores, eager to claim affinity with the actress or supermodel whose skin most matched our own. The girls who learned from Aucoin that they had heart-­shaped faces let everyone at school know about it in the nasal braggadocio common to a certain breed of adolescent queen bee. They were special; the rest of us could only dream of possessing jawlines that ended in a point like valentines.

‘‘Making Faces’’ transformed Aucoin, at 35, into an instant expert on the art of being beautiful. He published three such coffee-­table treatises in all, but ‘‘Faces’’ is his masterpiece, the purest distillation of his view that makeup is performance, an opportunity for women (and drag queens, of course) to gleefully metamorphose with just a few sweeps of a brush. When ‘‘Making Faces’’ came out, we had no Sephora, no YouTube tutorial to lay bare the intricacies of the smoky eye. What Aucoin did, first with ‘‘The Art of Makeup’’ in 1996 and then with ‘‘Making Faces,’’ was give us a codex, a working syllabus, a kind of ‘‘Joy of Cooking’’ with kohl.

In the introduction to ‘‘Faces,’’ after a page of candid Polaroids of the celebrities whose cheeks he had made dewy — a ’90s who’s who that included Drew Barrymore, Linda Evangelista, Courtney Love, Tina Turner, Lady Bunny — Aucoin wrote of growing up as a ‘‘gay, effeminate, hyperactive, adopted child with a serious lisp’’ in southern Louisiana. ‘‘While the other boys in my school dreamed of traveling to the moon or winning the Super Bowl,’’ he wrote, ‘‘I dreamt of glossy red lips and sparkling skin. By the age of 11, I knew I wanted to be a makeup artist.’’ Until I read ‘‘Faces,’’ I had always regarded makeup as a secret skill to be mastered. Aucoin insisted it was a game anyone could play. You just had to decide who you wanted to be that day.

‘‘Making Faces’’ grouped techniques under types, creating looks based on the women we aspired to be. There was the Chanteuse, the Bombshell, the Gamine. Each was defined by a particular makeup application, and each came with her own vignette. Of the Heroine, defined by pink blush and a minimal taupe lip pencil, he wrote: ‘‘From Joan of Arc to Amelia Earhart ... their look was ethereal yet practical to the point of androgyny.’’ Aucoin saw makeup as mythmaking: join the ranks of great women with a smear of pink gloss.

When Aucoin died at 40 of complications related to a pituitary brain tumor, I felt the pang of orphanhood, the kind you get when a mentoring force leaves the universe. Yet 13 years later, his ideas are more in vogue than ever. Contouring, a method of chiseling the face with shadow and light that he helped pioneer, has become a craze, thanks to its patron saint, Kim Kardashian. (Just last month, Kardashian sold out a 3,000-seat auditorium in Pasadena, Calif., for a contouring master class that cost as much as $1,000 a person.) The Aucoin contour book, a boxed set of bronzing and luminizing powders that honors his legacy, is available at Sephora.

Here is a quick lesson: Apply foundation and then a cream or powder a few shades lighter than your skin tone to your forehead and cheekbones and down the center line of the nose. Next, brush on a color a few shades darker and ruddier than your skin tone to the jawline, hairline, sides of the nose, and in the hollows of the cheeks. Before blending, it is not uncommon to look like Skeletor. But after you swirl the colors together and smooth out the lines, your cheeks will appear to jut out, your nose will look regal.

Bernie Sanders Has Heard About That Hashtag,"Photo

Do you think President Obama is a socialist? No.

What is your elevator pitch for socialism? My elevator pitch is that the United States has a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality where the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, where almost 20 percent of our children are living in poverty, 40 percent of African-American children are living in poverty. We are moving rapidly toward an oligarchic form of society where a small number of families control not only the economy but our political system as well. It is imperative that we develop a strong political movement that says to the billionaire class they cannot have it all.

A recent poll showed that Americans are more willing to vote for a Muslim or an atheist for president than a socialist. Do you think you could take back the word ‘‘socialism’’ and keep it from being what it is right now, which is almost a nasty word? Actually, what surprised me about that poll was, given the negative publicity that the word ‘‘socialism’’ has, that — what was the number of the people who were prepared to vote for a socialist?

It was in the high 40s. Yeah. Well, that’s pretty good, and it’ll get higher.

One of the few clear ideas that Americans have about socialism is that it involves high taxes. Can you sell that, the idea that you might have to raise taxes? I think we can sell the idea that when the rich are getting much richer and corporations are enjoying record-breaking profits that yes, they should start paying their fair share of taxes.

Are you familiar with the hashtag #Bernie­SoBlack? I’ve heard of it.

A lot of black activists felt as if, when they criticized you, the response they got back was ‘‘but he marched on Washington,’’ as though that were an absolution. And so it became this joke on Twitter: ‘‘Bernie’s so black, he’s the first one killed in horror movies.’’ ‘‘Bernie’s so black, he’s dropping a mix tape.’’ Well look, Black Lives Matter is a very, very serious issue. And clearly, as a nation, we have to move away from a situation where black women are dragged out of their cars, thrown to the ground, assaulted and then die in jail three days later for the crime of not signaling a lane change. Or more recently, a fellow named Samuel DuBose got shot in the head for the crime of not having a license plate on the front of his car.

Were you surprised that black activists responded so negatively to you at first? Yes, I was, because I think if you check the record, you will find that I have one of the strongest civil rights records in Congress, and this is an issue I feel strongly about.

What do you think of Donald Trump’s surge in the polls? Not much. I think Donald Trump’s views on immigration and his slurring of the Latino community is not something that should be going on in the year 2015, and it’s to me an embarrassment for our country.

Do you think it’s fair that Hillary’s hair gets a lot more scrutiny than yours does? Hillary’s hair gets more scrutiny than my hair?

Yeah. Is that what you’re asking?

Yeah. O.K., Ana, I don’t mean to be rude here. I am running for president of the United States on serious issues, O.K.? Do you have serious questions?

I can defend that as a serious question. There is a gendered reason — When the media worries about what Hillary’s hair looks like or what my hair looks like, that’s a real problem. We have millions of people who are struggling to keep their heads above water, who want to know what candidates can do to improve their lives, and the media will very often spend more time worrying about hair than the fact that we’re the only major country on earth that doesn’t guarantee health care to all people.

It’s also true that the media pays more attention to what female candidates look like than it does to what male candidates look like. That may be. That may be, and it’s absolutely wrong.",REAL
Handling a Racist Remark in the Workplace,"Photo

I represent a real-estate developer in Florida. Recently an employee of one of the developer’s commercial tenants confided to me that he overheard an administrator at his company tell another employee that she had just read a book called ‘‘The Protocols of the Elders of Zion’’ and thought it contained excellent points. The person with whom she was speaking, a department manager, responded that it was a great book and that it must be legitimate because it was endorsed by Henry Ford. I’m uncomfortable that this type of conversation might reflect a negative aspect of our tenant’s company culture. I’m tempted to raise this with the general counsel of the company, with whom I negotiated the lease — but for what purpose? I can’t betray the confidence, so what am I trying to accomplish? I can’t get over that employees working in a respected chain could really accept any premise in that anti-Semitic rant. I thought the reach of the book was limited to uneducated neo-Nazis, but these are educated people in positions of authority. Something just feels wrong here, and I would appreciate some guidance on where to go with this. NAME WITHHELD

Amy Bloom: I wish that this never happened, or only in tiny corners of America, but I suspect that is not the case. Did the person say to you that you absolutely could not share this with anybody? That’s one kind of confidence, but often we use the word more loosely, to mean ‘‘somebody passed this information to me in a friendly manner,’’ which does not bind you in any way. Even if the person confided in you and swore you to secrecy, which is not at all clear to me from this letter, I would also want to know at what level these people work, the administrator and the department manager.

The other question is: What is your goal here? I assume it’s to alter a business atmosphere that you think encourages anti-Semitism. But you don’t have any authority over the culture of this tenant corporation. If you wish to tell your client, the real-estate developer, what you heard, I think you can do that. If you wish to tell the general counsel what you heard without naming names, I think that’s O.K. too. I would suggest you not give any names, because you didn’t hear it directly — you are passing on something that you have been told. Also, you might want to encourage your pal, the employee who told you about this, to share the information at work with people who have some responsibility for their company’s culture. I think the personal part of your letter is that you’re just stunned anybody except uneducated neo-Nazis would accept something like ‘‘The Protocols of Zion.’’ Something is wrong there and part of what is wrong is that anti-Semitism, although it is not what it was in this country, is not gone.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: My first response to this letter was to be puzzled by the author’s surprise. I’m afraid there’s pretty good reason to think that stupid anti-Semitic beliefs and idiotic deference to the views of rich people like Henry Ford are quite pervasive in our country. It’s definitely out there in the land.

Now, I would talk to the person who told you this and say, ‘‘I’d like your permission to raise the matter in a way that doesn’t identify you, because I think your company will want to know that this is going on, and it will be up to the company to figure out how to change its culture.’’ There are actually people who consult with companies that have these sorts of problems. I’m sure there are people who can help you change a business culture in which this sort of thing is going on. But if the person who told you this told you in strict confidence, you can’t pass it on unless they give you permission.",REAL
Myanmar’s Many Funks and Flavors,"Photo

All I’ve ever known about Myanmar has been from the news: democracy advocates silenced with bullets; opposition politicians imprisoned by the government; soldiers opening a new campaign to oppress ethnic minorities. But in June, eating noodles with lemongrass broth at a rented high-school cafeteria in Queens, I finally got to see Myanmar as something else: a homeland, a people. Myo Moe, a photographer who grew up in Yangon, when its name was Rangoon, when the country was still Burma, invited me to the Moegyo Burmese Food Fair, a fund-raiser for Burmese orphans. ‘‘Here, our community is very tight,’’ she said. ‘‘We come from different backgrounds, but the food connects us — it’s how we’re related to each other. We can’t get it in any store, so when we have our food, we don’t even care about our backgrounds anymore.’’ It was a lovely, hopeful thing to hear about people who come from a place in the midst of a 60-year ethnic conflict.

Dozens of tables surrounded the room, a dizzying tour of the cuisine: There were slippery rice noodles with rich, puréed chickpea gravy; salads made from fermented tea leaves, darkly herbal and invigorating; crisp-fried pork belly and sweetly stewed livers; mohinga, a tart and savory fish soup that tasted somehow like toasted nuts; a thousand more funks and flavors, all made by volunteers. Myo brought falooda, a rosewater ice-cream float with chewy tapioca pearls and bites of custard, a treat with Indian parents and Persian ancestors.

Hundreds of people had gathered: families, extended families, made-up families, impromptu class reunions from decades ago and 8,000 miles away, foodies excitedly jabbing spoons into unfamiliar pleasures. I talked with a man named James Hsu, who had the air of a beloved, retired mayor. He showed me around, stopping at each table to introduce me to the dishes and the cooks, who ranged from housekeepers to doctors like himself. A Bamar, like the majority of the country, he was forced after medical school into a post in the conflict zone between the government and Karen rebels from Kayin State. Underequipped and unprotected from rebel kidnappers, he and his wife decided to flee. For seven nights, they walked with their infant deeper into Kayin territory toward Thailand. For seven nights, Karen strangers took them in, fed them, let them wash and sleep. I asked him if he had been worried about staying in these people’s homes; wasn’t he the enemy? ‘‘No, the thing is, their problem is with the government and the army and their atrocities, not the regular people.’’ In gratitude, he returns to Karen refugee camps every year to volunteer, for weeks at a time.

Hsu led me to Thin Thin Le, a Karen woman who works as a nanny, making tohu thoke, which translates roughly to tofu salad, and which is far more delicious than that sounds. The ‘‘tofu’’ is actually a quick, firm polenta made from chickpea flour, dressed with an oniony oil and a deep, tangy tamarind dressing, and then showered with herbs and crisp-fried garlic. It’s mellow and creamy like hummus, but with a crash of shallots and cilantro. I had a bowl, then another, then I bought two more to take home.

Dumb with deliciousness, I could barely say anything to Le besides, ‘‘Will you teach me to make this?’’ She smiled wide, but paused. She lives with friends, she said, and didn’t know if it would be O.K. to invite me over. So she packed up a big bag of groceries, pots and bowls, lugging it on her maybe 5-foot, 100-pound frame for an hour on the train to my house. We cooked while she explained that tohu thoke isn’t traditionally Karen but is from the Shan people, another minority, but that the dish is beloved all over the country.

How to Be Naked in Public,"Photo

Begin by practicing in private. ‘‘Sure, you can be nude in your own shower,’’ Stéphane Deschênes says, ‘‘but how about sitting in the living room watching TV? How about having dinner?’’

Deschênes oversees all non-­European countries in the International Naturist Federation, an organization with headquarters in Austria that acts as a sort of United Nations of nudism. He also teaches a course called Public Nudity: History, Law and Science at the University of Toronto and owns a popular nudist camp on the city’s outskirts. ‘‘Your confidence in who you are should not be based on the artificiality of your clothing,’’ Deschênes says.

The first time you strip down in front of strangers, do so at a specified nudist destination — a sauna or a beach where everyone else will also be unclothed. If some are covered up, you get what Deschênes calls a ‘‘voyeur-­exhibitionist relationship.’’ To be truly at ease, you have to be naked for yourself, not for the pleasure of others. The moments before disrobing are always the most anxious. On average, it takes an hour for people to get comfortable and begin frolicking ‘‘like 5-year-olds running around the backyard,’’ says Deschênes, who in the summertime goes naked at home and work about 80 percent of the time, occasionally donning a fleece throw to ward off a chill or an apron to protect against hot bacon grease.

Choose your activities carefully. Swimming is the easiest for beginners. Volleyball and other jumping sports are more challenging. Yoga can be particularly intimidating, even for committed nudists.

Don’t be surprised if you occasionally experience phantom clothes. After decades of living as a naturist — his preferred term and the one used in Europe — Deschênes still sometimes reaches to pull up his nonexistent pants after using the restroom.

Initially, the parts of your body you are most insecure about — genitals, breasts, hips, moles, whatever — will loom large. ‘‘You’ll imagine people are looking at that thing, but they’re not,’’ Deschênes says. Still, expect some wandering eyes, including your own. It is natural, for newbies especially, to look longer at parts of the body typically covered by clothes. Deschênes suggests a basic rule: ‘‘Looking is normal, but don’t stare.’’",REAL

‘‘I’m going to La Plaza,’’ I said. It’s a shopping mall. ‘‘I’m meeting my boyfriend to see a movie.’’ I don’t have a boyfriend, but La Plaza is a place with lots of people, where the first thing I’d see is a security guard.

The first thing I did was reach into my bag for my phone and dial my mother’s number. I thought, If this woman doesn’t let me get off, at least my mother will hear what’s happening. But I couldn’t find ‘‘send,’’ probably because I was nervous.

‘‘Nothing,’’ I said. ‘‘Just looking for coins.’’

‘‘O.K.,’’ she said. ‘‘So we get off at La Plaza.’’

‘‘Sure,’’ I said.

When we were getting close, she said, ‘‘Are you going to give me your newspaper?’’

I told her to take it, that I’d already read it.

I don’t know how I got out of there without tripping over her or showing her my back. She said: ‘‘Take care of yourself, mami. Don’t let anything happen to you. And say hello to your boyfriend for me.’’

RE: ISSA RAE

Jenna Wortham profiled Issa Rae, who created the acclaimed web series ‘‘The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl’’ but has not found similar success on mainstream television, despite the support of directors and producers like Shonda Rhimes.

One way of looking at diversity in Hollywood would make women and people of color responsible for building a pipeline for people like them, the Rhimeses of the world lifting up the Raes. But another route to, as Wortham puts it, ‘‘broaden the types of stories being told about black America’’ might be to create not a single broad superhighway to the silver screen, but multiple more specific routes for performers like Rae to travel. A Hollywood where Rhimes and [Betsy Beers, Rhimes’s production partner] aren’t assigned sole responsibility for the careers of up-and-coming black female showrunners, and where someone like Rae can find multiple champions, is better for everyone. There’s more to diverse television than Thursday nights on ABC. And thank goodness for that. Alyssa Rosenberg, in an article for The Washington Post

I opened the magazine section to an ad for a luxury apartment building costing $7 million to $25 million per unit, inhabited by a white family. There were four more ads with all white models, and a response to a New York Times survey, ‘‘Are your friends diverse?’’ (50-50 yes/no). The only ads with models of color were for the U.S. Open (Serena Williams) and the upscale shopping center Brookfield Place, with a blond woman dancing to the beat of a light-skinned African-American drummer. Is it any wonder Issa Rae is having trouble replicating the success of her web series ‘‘The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl’’ in Hollywood? Ellen J. Pader, Amherst, Mass.

RE: KANSAS

Chris Suellentrop chronicled the efforts of some members of the Republican-led Kansas Legislature — including his uncle, Representative Gene Suellentrop — to address a large budgetary deficit while maintaining the state’s recently enacted income tax exemption for some businesses.

Photo

Suellentrop’s portrayal of the experiment in Kansas conjures the image of a mad scientist stitching together a monster, which will in due course do great harm to the community. Gov. Sam Brownback’s obsession with disproven supply-side economics points out that reasoning and facts scarcely matter to many on the Republican right. This situation should be a cautionary tale for the 2016 elections. Eliminating taxes on business owners while favoring sales taxes merely exacerbates the economic inequality that characterizes our society. Reducing funding for education sacrifices the future on the altar of tax cuts. This story will have an unhappy ending unless Kansas voters stop electing politicians who do not serve the common good.

The Bail Trap,"‘‘Criminal justice,’’ President Obama said in a speech to the N.A.A.C.P. last month, ‘‘is not as fair as it should be. Mass incarceration makes our country worse off, and we need to do something about it.’’ Two days after the speech, Obama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison, meeting with convicts in a corrections institution in El Reno, Okla. The setting was dramatic, but mass incarceration isn’t actually a federal problem. Of the 2.2 million people currently locked up in this country, fewer than one in 10 is being held in a federal prison. Far more are serving time in state prisons, and nearly three-quarters of a million aren’t in prison at all but in local city and county jails. Of those in jails, 60 percent haven’t been convicted of anything. They’re innocent in the eyes of the law, awaiting resolution in their cases. Some of these inmates are being held because they’re considered dangerous or unlikely to return to court for their hearings. But many of them simply cannot afford to pay the bail that has been set.

Occasionally, these cases make the news. In June, Sandra Bland was found dead in her cell in Texas after failing to come up with $500 for her release. But often, they go unnoticed. The federal government doesn’t track the number of people locked up because they can’t make bail. What we do know is that at any given time, close to 450,000 people are in pretrial detention in the United States — a figure that includes both those denied bail and those unable to pay the bail that has been set. Even that figure fails to capture the churn of local incarceration: In a given year, city and county jails across the country admit between 11 million and 13 million people. In New York City, where courts use bail far less than in many jurisdictions, roughly 45,000 people are jailed each year simply because they can’t pay their court-assigned bail. And while the city’s courts set bail much lower than the national average, only one in 10 defendants is able to pay it at arraignment. To put a finer point on it: Even when bail is set comparatively low — at $500 or less, as it is in one-third of nonfelony cases — only 15 percent of defendants are able to come up with the money to avoid jail.

Bail hasn’t always been a mechanism for locking people up. When the concept first took shape in England during the Middle Ages, it was emancipatory. Rather than detaining people indefinitely without trial, magistrates were required to let defendants go free before seeing a judge, guaranteeing their return to court with a bond. If the defendant failed to return, he would forfeit the amount of the bond. The bond might be secured — that is, with some or all of the amount of the bond paid in advance and returned at the end of the trial — or it might not. In 1689, the English Bill of Rights outlawed the widespread practice of keeping defendants in jail by setting deliberately unaffordable bail, declaring that ‘‘excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed.’’ The same language was adopted word for word a century later in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

But as bail has evolved in America, it has become less and less a tool for keeping people out of jail, and more and more a trap door for those who cannot afford to pay it. Unsecured bond has become vanishingly rare, and in most jurisdictions, there are only two ways to make bail: post the entire amount yourself up front — what’s called ‘‘money bail’’ or ‘‘cash bail’’ — or pay a commercial bail bondsman to do so. For relatively low bail amounts — say, below $2,000, the range in which most New York City bails fall — the second option often doesn’t even exist; bondsmen can’t make enough money from such small bails to make it worth their while.

With national attention suddenly focused on the criminal-justice system, bail has been cited as an easy target for reformers. But ensuring that no one is held in jail based on poverty would, in many respects, necessitate a complete reordering of criminal justice. The open secret is that in most jurisdictions, bail is the grease that keeps the gears of the overburdened system turning. Faced with the prospect of going to jail for want of bail, many defendants accept plea deals instead, sometimes at their arraignments. New York City courts processed 365,000 arraignments in 2013; well under 5 percent of those cases went all the way to a trial resolution. If even a small fraction of those defendants asserted their right to a trial, criminal courts would be overwhelmed. By encouraging poor defendants to plead guilty, bail keeps the system afloat.

‘‘What, did they arrest all of Brooklyn today?’’ one court officer asked another on a recent Sunday night in one of the two bustling arraignment courtrooms in Downtown Brooklyn. Defendants, a vast majority of them black, paraded past the judge in quick succession: Unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. Open container of alcohol in public. Marijuana possession. Riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. Misdemeanors, many of them minor, some aggravated by an outstanding bench warrant for failure to appear in court on another case, failure to complete court-ordered community service or failure to pay a fine. Hundreds of people were awaiting arraignment, first in central booking across the street, then in cells on the ninth floor and finally in a small communal cell called ‘‘the pen’’ behind the arraignment courtrooms on the ground floor. On this night, there were more than a dozen men in the cell waiting to see a lawyer, pacing, sitting on benches, crouching in corners.

One man called out from the pen, saying that there was dried excrement in there from the day before. ‘‘Nobody comes in here to clean!’’ he exclaimed. ‘‘It’s mad dirty!’’ A guard approached the bars and briefly sprayed a can of air freshener. Around the corner, the pen opened onto a series of booths, where, separated by heavy metal screens, the defendants met with their lawyers. Scott Hechinger, a senior trial attorney with Brooklyn Defender Services, picked up a stack of case files, quickly scanned the charges and rap sheets, stepped down a short hallway behind the courtroom and started calling names through the mesh screen. The first client was charged with criminal mischief after getting in an argument with his girlfriend and breaking some bowls. It was more complicated than that, he told Hechinger. She came home drunk, threw his clothes out the window. It escalated. He left. They arrested him across the street. Hechinger called the girlfriend and left a message. He called the client’s mother, whom the man lived with. If bail was set, how much could she afford? At most $250. Time’s up. Next case.

A young man jumped a subway turnstile. Prosecutors were offering to make it go away and let him out that night if he did two days of community service and avoided being rearrested for the next six months. This one was easy. ‘‘Take the deal,’’ Hechinger said. It was better than paying a $120 fee.

Next up was a homeless teenager, charged with ‘‘obstruction of governmental administration.’’ The paperwork said the police saw him with a knife, and that he resisted arrest. He said there was no knife, that the cops stopped him for no reason and beat him. He showed Hechinger bruises on his arms and a fat lip. It was hard to see much through the screen. Hechinger promised to take a closer look in a few minutes when they were in front of the judge together. The final person was a man arrested for driving with a suspended license, a straightforward case.

Photo

After less than half an hour, Hechinger was back in the courtroom. The defendants he interviewed were marched out onto a bench against the left wall. First was the turnstile jumper. The prosecutor laid out the charges and the offer. The defendant took the deal and would have to complete community service. Next was the homeless teenager. The prosecutor asked for bail of $5,000. Hechinger argued that bail was unnecessary. The judge set it at $250. The teenager didn’t have it. He would be sleeping at Rikers. The guy with the suspended license was released on his own recognizance — without any bail — and would be due back in court in a couple of months. Next appeared the man who broke his girlfriend’s bowls. The prosecutor wanted bail set at $2,500. Hechinger argued that there was no reason to believe his client wouldn’t return to court on his own. The judge set it at $1,000. ‘‘Your honor, I called the mother, she said she could afford $250,’’ Hechinger said. ‘‘I’m sorry, counselor, that’s my bail decision,’’ the judge responded.

Another half-hour had elapsed. Hechinger went back to the case pile and picked up another stack. One of the three other defenders working the courtroom stepped up with her own cases. When court shut down for the night at 1 a.m., defendants were still waiting. They would stay in their cells and be arraigned when court started up again in the morning.

The sheer speed of the arraignment process makes it virtually impossible for the court to make informed decisions. Prosecutors have nothing to go on but a statement from the police and possibly a complaining witness, and defense lawyers know only what they’ve been able to glean from their brief interviews and perhaps a phone call or two. It’s in this hurried moment, at the very outset of a criminal case, before evidence has been weighed or even gathered, that a defendant’s freedom is decided. The stakes are high, and not only for the obvious reason that jail is an unpleasant and often dangerous place to be. A pretrial stretch in jail can unravel the lives of vulnerable defendants in significant ways.

The next hearing in Tyrone Tomlin’s drinking-straw case was scheduled for a week after his arraignment. He left the courthouse, was loaded onto a bus and crossed the narrow causeway that connects Queens to Rikers. Tomlin was assigned to the Anna M. Kross Center, one of 10 correctional facilities on the island.

Incarcerated people rarely have nice things to say about the places where they’re locked up, but an investigation by the United States attorney’s office this year found ‘‘a deep-seated culture of violence’’ among Rikers guards, who reported using force against inmates more than 4,000 times last year. Violence among inmates is also pervasive. A Department of Corrections document obtained by The Daily News reported 108 stabbings and slashings in the last year. ‘‘That place is miserable,’’ Tomlin said. ‘‘It’s dangerous. It’s every man for himself. You could get abused, you could get raped, you could get extorted. That stuff is all around.’’

Photo

Housed in a unit with more than 50 other prisoners, Tomlin tried to keep his head down, and he was able to get through a week without incident. Outside, his aunt worried about him. His employer had no idea where he was. On Nov. 25, he was back in court for a discovery hearing, during which prosecutors were supposed to turn over any relevant evidence. None was presented, but prosecutors repeated their offer for Tomlin to plead guilty. He still refused. ‘‘I wasn’t taking nothing, because I didn’t do nothing,’’ he says. His case was adjourned for another two weeks.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Tomlin’s willingness to hold out against the charges was unusual. Across the criminal-justice system, bail acts as a tool of compulsion, forcing people who would not otherwise plead guilty to do so. A 2012 report by the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, based on 10 years’ worth of criminal statistics, bears this out. In nonfelony cases in which defendants were not detained before their trials, either because no bail was set or because they were able to pay it, only half were eventually convicted. When defendants were locked up until their cases were resolved, the conviction rate jumped to 92 percent. This isn’t just anecdotal; a multivariate analysis found that even controlling for other factors, pretrial detention was the single greatest predictor of conviction. ‘‘The data suggest that detention itself creates enough pressure to increase guilty pleas,’’ the report concluded.

Still awaiting a trial, Tomlin returned to Rikers and quickly got into trouble with a group of younger inmates while on the phone with his aunt. ‘‘A young guy tells me, ‘Yo, pop, you gotta get off the phone,’ ’’ he said. ‘‘I said, ‘I’m in the middle of an important call.’ He wanted me to just hang up.’’ Tomlin quickly realized he’d made a mistake. That evening, in the shower, he was jumped by a group of young men. ‘‘Most of the punches went to the side of my head and my eye,’’ he said. ‘‘I was tussling one and had to worry about the other three, there was blows coming from everywhere.’’ Punched, kicked and stomped, Tomlin received medical attention, his face monstrously misshapen, his left eye swollen shut. ‘‘You’d think I was Frankenstein’s brother or something,’’ he said.

Tomlin’s eye was still swollen shut on Dec. 10, three weeks after his arrest, when he returned to court. At this hearing, prosecutors handed over a report from the police laboratory, which had tested the drinking straw. At the top of the report, in bold, underlined capital letters, were the words ‘‘No Controlled Substance Identified, Notify District Attorney.’’

The report had been faxed to the district attorney on Nov. 25, the same day as Tomlin’s last court hearing and days before his beating. The key to his freedom had been sitting unexamined. Conceding that the case had unraveled, the prosecutor asked that the charges be dismissed. ‘‘The judge says, ‘Mr. Tomlin, this is your lucky day, you’re going home,’ ’’ Tomlin recalls. ‘‘I just left the courtroom, signed some papers and that was it.’’

Tomlin had lost three weeks of income, was subjected to brutal physical violence and missed Thanksgiving dinner with his family. But he resisted the pressure to plead guilty. His previous convictions all came from pleas, most of them made with bail looming over him. He knows the bitter Catch-22 of pleading guilty to get out of jail. ‘‘It feels great to go home,’’ he says. ‘‘Anybody’s happy to go home. But at the same time, it feels bad, because that’s more damage on your record.’’

For defendants who would fight their cases and maintain their innocence if they had the money, a guilty plea involves a ritual of court procedure that verges on the Kafkaesque:

‘‘Your lawyer tells me you want to plead guilty to the charge. Is that correct?’’ the judge will ask. Yes, the defendant must reply.

‘‘You understand that by your plea of guilty you are giving up certain trial rights?’’ Yes.

‘‘The right to remain silent, the right to confront witnesses against you, the right to have the prosecutor prove your guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?’’ Yes, yes, yes.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

And then: ‘‘Are you pleading guilty freely and voluntarily, because you are in fact guilty?’’

Hechinger, the lawyer with Brooklyn Defender Services, hates this part of the process. ‘‘A lot of times, at that last question, you feel the client beside you bristle,’’ he says. ‘‘Everyone in the room knows it’s not ‘freely and voluntarily.’ They’re making a decision coerced by money. In many cases, if they had money, they wouldn’t be pleading. But they put their heads down, and they say, ‘Yes.’ It’s a horrible, deflating feeling.’’

Photo

The long-term damage that bail inflicts on vulnerable defendants extends well beyond incarceration. Disappearing into the machinery of the justice system separates family members, interrupts work and jeopardizes housing. ‘‘Most of our clients are people who have crawled their way up from poverty or are in the throes of poverty,’’ Hechinger says. ‘‘Our clients work in service-level positions where if you’re gone for a day, you lose your job. People in need of caretaking — the elderly, the young — are left without caretakers. People who live in shelters, where if they miss their curfews, they lose their housing. Folks with immigration concerns are quicker to be put on the immigration radar. So when our clients have bail set, they suffer on the inside, they worry about what’s happening on the outside, and when they get out, they come back to a world that’s more difficult than the already difficult situation that they were in before.’’

This spring, a 24-year-old woman named Adriana found herself newly single in New York, trying to make a life for herself and her daughter. Short and round, with oversize glasses that frequently slide off her nose, she has an easy manner and deadpan sense of humor that belie her past as a runaway from an abusive mother. Adriana arrived in New York in the middle of 2014 with her baby daughter, not yet 2, and knew no one but her boyfriend at the time, a controlling figure who lived off her earnings from massages she advertised on Craigslist. (Like many runaways, Adriana had sometimes relied on sex work to survive, though recently she was trying to avoid it.) After separating from her boyfriend, Adriana managed to secure a spot in a Brooklyn shelter for victims of domestic violence. ‘‘I was trying to get a job, trying to get my life together,’’ she says. She was focused on her daughter. ‘‘I just want to be the best mother for her that I can be,’’ she says. ‘‘That’s my priority. That’s my only priority.’’ (Because of safety concerns, Adriana asked not to be identified by her full name.)

On the night of March 18, Adriana realized she was running low on diapers. A friend at the shelter who also had a child agreed to keep an eye on her daughter, and Adriana headed to a nearby Target. This was after curfew, and when a staff member saw Adriana leaving without her daughter, she called the police. ‘‘When I got to Target, I started getting all these texts from my friend,’’ Adriana says. ‘‘She was saying, ‘You’ve got to get back here — there are staff in your room, and they won’t let me in to look after the baby.’ ’’ Adriana rushed home with the diapers. In the shelter’s courtyard, she was met by police officers, who had her daughter.

‘‘Where are you going with my baby?’’ she asked, according to court documents. ‘‘That’s my baby. I just went to the store to buy diapers.’’ It didn’t matter. The police placed her under arrest, charging her with endangering the welfare of a child. She gave one of the officers the diapers she’d just bought, in case her daughter needed to be changed. She was handcuffed and taken to the precinct. The police took her daughter to the station, too, where she was turned over to the city’s Administration for Children’s Services and eventually placed in a foster home.

Before her arraignment two days later, Adriana explained to her public defender what happened. Her friend could confirm that she was looking after the baby, she said. The lawyer told Adriana she’d do her best to get her released on her own recognizance. But when Adriana appeared in front of Judge Rosemarie Montalbano, the assistant district attorney asked for bail to be set at $5,000. Adriana had no criminal record and had never failed to make a court appearance, but the prosecutor cited an ‘‘A.C.S. history,’’ meaning that Adriana and her daughter had previous contact with the Administration for Children’s Services. This was true but misleading. The A.C.S. report involving Adriana had found that she wasn’t responsible for any neglect or abuse. What the A.C.S. did find was violence and coercion on the part of her boyfriend; this is how Adriana landed a spot in the domestic-violence shelter.

Photo

But arraignments happen quickly. Just as there was no time to track down Adriana’s friend to confirm that her daughter hadn’t been left unsupervised, there was no time to find out what the A.C.S. order actually said. The judge set bail at $1,500. Adriana’s public defender couldn’t believe it. ‘‘Judge, I’m going to ask you to state the reason for setting bail in this case,’’ she said, according to the court transcript. ‘‘Thank you, counsel,’’ was the judge’s only reply.

With no way to come up with $1,500, Adriana spent the next two weeks on Rikers Island. Her bail made it harder for her to fight her case, but it also effectively dismantled the new life she was trying to build for herself and her daughter. She lost her bed at the shelter, and her child was living with strangers. ‘‘It feels like they were kicking me when I was down,’’ she says.

Over subsequent hearings, Adriana’s lawyers tried to get her bail lifted, but they ran into another common problem facing defendants: Once a judge sets bail, other judges are often reluctant to second-guess their colleague’s decision. If they free a defendant who commits a crime while out on bail, the blowback from politicians, police unions and the tabloid press can be substantial. ‘‘I have no idea what motivated Judge Montalbano to set bail,’’ said Judge Andrew Borrok at one of Adriana’s hearings, four days after her arraignment. Still, he said, ‘‘I’m not inclined to change what’s been done.’’

Adriana’s lawyers managed to move her case to a court that specialized in sex-trafficking cases, hoping for a more sympathetic judge and prosecutors. In the trafficking court, however, prosecutors remained reluctant to lift bail, now citing concerns that Adriana’s safety could be at risk if her ex-boyfriend found out she was set free. Ultimately, after two weeks of hearings, prosecutors agreed to remove Adriana’s bail provided she complete weekly ‘‘life-skills coursework’’ administered by a group that serves arrested sex workers. ‘‘Congratulations on being in a place where a lot of people care about you,’’ Adriana remembers the judge telling her as she stood before him in handcuffs, quietly asking a court officer to push her glasses back up her nose. ‘‘There’s a lot of people in this room that want good things to happen to you. The fear is that you’re not ready for all of these great things.’’

The judge ordered Adriana released. She could begin reassembling her life, finding a new shelter, retrieving whatever remained of her possessions. But her baby was still in foster care, and her case still wasn’t resolved. In June, a judge finally agreed to dismiss her case if she wasn’t arrested for the next six months. As this story went to press, five months after her arrest, she was still fighting in family court to regain custody of her daughter.

Outside the courtroom after the hearing for her release, Scott Hechinger, who helped coordinate Adriana’s defense, was exasperated. ‘‘Remember,’’ he said, ‘‘this is all about some diapers! Bail changes the conversation. If bail hadn’t been set, Adriana wouldn’t have to be negotiating to get out of Rikers. She’d just be released.’’

In early 2013, Jonathan Lippman, chief judge of the State of New York, decided that the business-as-usual approach to setting bail could not be tolerated any longer. ‘‘We still have a long way to go before we can claim that we have established a coherent, rational approach to pretrial justice,’’ he said in his annual State of the Judiciary address. ‘‘Incarcerating indigent defendants for no other reason than that they cannot meet even a minimum bail amount strips our justice system of its credibility and distorts its operation.’’ Lipp­man sent a package of proposed legislation to reduce the reliance on cash bail to lawmakers in Albany, and he lobbied for the reforms hard in the press. His efforts went nowhere. ‘‘Zero,’’ Lippman says, shaking his head. ‘‘Nothing.’’ Lawmakers had no appetite for bail reform.

Two years later, that may be changing. This summer, the New York City Council took a tentative step toward reform by earmarking $1.4 million for a citywide fund to bail out low-level offenders. The fund, proposed with much fanfare by Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito in her State of the City address in February, is modeled on a number of smaller bail funds around the city. The oldest of these, the Bronx Freedom Fund, was established in 2007 in association with the Bronx Defenders, a public-defender organization. The founders shut down the fund after only a year and a half, after a judge argued that it was effectively operating as an unlicensed bail-bond business. But before they did, the fund bailed out nearly 200 defendants and generated some illuminating statistics. Ninety-six percent of the fund’s clients made it to every one of their court appearances, a return rate higher even than that of people who posted their own bail. More than half of the Freedom Fund’s clients, now able to fight their cases outside jail, saw their charges completely dismissed. Not a single client went to jail on the charges for which bail had been posted. By comparison, defendants held on bail for the duration of their cases were convicted 92 percent of the time. The numbers showed what everyone familiar with the system already knew anecdotally: Bail makes poor people who would otherwise win their cases plead guilty.

Armed with these statistics, as well as a 2010 Human Rights Watch report that calculated that New York City was paying $42 million a year to incarcerate nonfelony defendants, the Freedom Fund’s founders managed to persuade state lawmakers to pass legislation explicitly legalizing nonprofit bail funds. In 2013, the Freedom Fund resumed operation. Close behind was the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, begun by Scott Hechinger and a colleague at Brooklyn Defender Services. It was opened this spring and has already bailed out more than 60 clients.

But even the staunchest supporters of bail funds are quick to say that they are, at best, temporary Band-Aids for a broken system. ‘‘They are a useful form of relief as long as people are being locked up because they’re poor,’’ says Hechinger, who is no longer affiliated with the Brooklyn bail fund. ‘‘They’re an intervention for an urgent need. But they’re not actual bail reform.’’

Earlier this summer, in the wake of the shocking suicide of Kalief Browder, a Bronx teenager arrested on suspicion of stealing a backpack and held on bail for three years in Rikers before his case was dismissed, Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled his own initiative. ‘‘I wish, I deeply wish, we hadn’t lost him — but he did not die in vain,’’ de Blasio said. The centerpiece of de Blasio’s initiative is a $17.8 million citywide initiative based on pilot programs that have been running in Queens and Manhattan, offering something called ‘‘supervised release.’’ Under these programs, a small number of qualifying defendants, who might otherwise be held on bail, are instead set free and required to check in with caseworkers by phone and in person. The pilot programs have shown good results, but they have narrowly tailored eligibility requirements. Tyrone Tomlin, for example, would not have been eligible because he had too many previous convictions. Kalief Browder would not have been eligible, either, because the crime he was accused of, stealing a backpack, was charged as second-degree robbery, a violent felony. ‘‘If Kalief Browder’s death wasn’t in vain,’’ says Peter Goldberg, executive director of the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, ‘‘it won’t be because of the proposals we’ve seen so far from the city.’’

The only truly meaningful reform, many observers agree, is to take money out of the bail process entirely. Lippman has been championing this idea for several years. ‘‘You have to eliminate cash bail,’’ he says. The ramifications of such a move are far-reaching. Without bail — and the quick guilty pleas that it produces — courts would come under significant strain. ‘‘The system would shut down,’’ Goldberg says. ‘‘A lot of the 250 people who were waiting to be arraigned in Brooklyn last night would all be coming back to court soon to go forward with a trial for a misdemeanor that no one has any interest in pursuing.’’ This crisis, Goldberg believes, would be a good thing. ‘‘You want pressure on the system. You want everyone involved to be reconsidering. Because of how much it could clog the system, you might have people on high telling cops to stop picking people up for an open-container violation, because ‘I don’t want to deal with it in my courtroom.’ ’’

The idea of eliminating cash bail is hardly unprecedented. When Washington overhauled its bail system in the 1980s and ’90s, it instituted a supervised-release program and other measures designed to reduce the number of people held on bail. But judges continued to set bail until the law was rewritten to effectively forbid the imprisonment of people on financial grounds. The number of people locked up on bail plummeted. ‘‘D.C. had all the tools in place,’’ says Cherise Fanno Burdeen, executive director of the Pretrial Justice Institute. ‘‘They just needed a way to change the court culture.’’ Kentucky, Colorado and, last year, New Jersey have joined Washington in adopting legislation severely curtailing bail’s use.

The more modest reforms being proposed in New York City, Goldberg says, are hardly cause for celebration. ‘‘Robert Kennedy, when he was attorney general, raised exactly the concerns with bail we’re talking about now,’’ he says. ‘‘Fifty years later, we’re still having the conversation. We can’t be satisfied with cosmetic fixes. And the truth is, even meaningful bail reform is just the beginning. The real work is asking why we’re arresting so many people on low-level offenses in the first place, and why so many of them come from poor black and brown communities. Bail is easy.’’

In late June, Tyrone Tomlin sat at a picnic table in St. John’s Park in Crown Heights, trying to cool down after a hot day of work and sipping bodega iced tea through a straw. Beneath his baseball cap, his left eye still looked askew, his gaze unfocused and hard to meet. ‘‘My sight is still a little blurry,’’ he said. ‘‘I still feel the aftereffects. Pains in my eye, in my head.’’ The whole situation could have been worse, he knows. He could have been hurt more seriously at Rikers. He could have been fired from his construction job, after being a no-show for the better part of a month while locked up. But even so, he was still angry about what happened last winter. ‘‘I’m not no prince,’’ he acknowledged. ‘‘But I got a raw deal.’’

The inability to make bail has been a virtual constant in Tomlin’s life. His first encounter with the law came when he was 14 or 15 — he recalls being picked up on a robbery charge and sent to Spofford juvenile detention center in the Bronx because his family couldn’t pay bail. After a few months, he says, he pleaded guilty and received probation. ‘‘They said it’s supposed to teach you a lesson,’’ he said. ‘‘It just got me worse.’’ In two-thirds of the times he has pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in the last 14 years, he did so either at arraignment to avoid being sent to Rikers or after already spending as much as two weeks at Rikers. Not once has he been able to pay bail.

“I’m not Johnny Rich-Kid with a silver spoon,” he says. For Tomlin, the historical evolutions of bail and pretrial jurisprudence are abstractions without meaning in his life. Bail is simply a feature of the landscape, the thing that means he is locked up when someone with more money wouldn’t be. ‘‘Sure, yeah, I’m mad about it,’’ he said grudgingly. ‘‘But that’s the way it is. I’ve got to accept it. It’s not right, but it’s the way it is.’’ He shrugged. ‘‘What are you going to do?’’",REAL
"Welcome to Liberland, the World’s Newest Country (Maybe)","And so, on April 13, 2015, he and his exploratory committee read, in English and Czech, the following proclamation:

We, the members of the Preparatory Committee of the State of the Free Republic of Liberland, issue this proclamation:

We, by virtue of the right to self-determination, right of discovery and the right of self-governance, proclaim the existence of the Free Republic of Liberland. The Free Republic is a free and independent country; and that as a free and independent state, the Free Republic of Liberland shall have the full power to defend itself, conclude peace, form alliances, establish commerce, and enjoy any other rights which sovereign states have. As a member of the family of nations, we pledge to abide by international laws that bind all states in existence.

2. The President

Jedlicka had long dreamed of such a proclamation. An avowed small-government libertarian and euroskeptic, he searched for two years for suitable territory on which to establish Liberland. The man he intermittently calls minister of information technology eventually discovered the plot via consultation of the ‘‘terra nullius’’ entry on Wikipedia. According to the homestead principle, as well as the rules stipulated by the Montevideo Convention of 1933, Jedlicka felt the land was technically his after the flag-planting rite, carried out by Jedlicka, his girlfriend and a college friend. Though he claims he did not seek political office himself, and he in fact recused himself from the initial round of voting, Jedlicka was immediately elected the nation’s first president by a vote of two to zero.

In the days that followed his proclamation, President Jedlicka was unsurprised and unembarrassed by the dismissals of the international community; he knew recognition would come with time, once the land was properly settled and his intentions were made clear. The day after he declared independence, the Serbian government released a communiqué that declared the birth of the new nation to be a ‘‘frivolous act’’ that it was prepared to ignore. Croatia’s official position was that it considered Liberland to be ‘‘a joke.’’ When Jedlicka, soon after his election, tried to approach the Croatian foreign minister in Zagreb to talk over the matter, he says her bodyguards blocked his advances, and she fled on foot.

The President is a sturdy man of thickening athletic build, with blond hair and a reddish blond goatee that diminishes up his high-colored cheeks into blond peach fuzz and then asserts itself anew as bright blond bushy eyebrows over long platinum lashes. He is a soft-spoken, gentle ruler, well mannered and with a schoolboyish eagerness to please. For the first three weeks after the flag-planting ceremony, he and his founding committee could come and go from Liberland as they liked. He spent most of his time at the first Liberlandian Embassy, in Prague, a terraced apartment in the sun atop a hillside not far from Wenceslas Square that is also his home. (Jedlicka enjoys the free and casual use of such terms as ‘‘embassy,’’ ‘‘ambassador’’ and ‘‘minister,’’ though in his more legalistic moods, he is careful to qualify all of them with the adjective ‘‘future.’’) Then, on weekends, he drove the eight hours to Liberland at his leisure.

By May 8, though, which Jedlicka had planned as Liberation Day, his initial command of the situation had begun to erode. Domestically, the legitimacy of his administration was being challenged by a group that called itself the Liberland Settlement Association. The L.S.A., led by a Danish Bitcoin trader living in Switzerland, took at face value the President’s initial declaration of Liberland as a radical libertarian experiment: They moved quickly to settle Liberland themselves, on the premise that it was as much theirs as anyone’s. On the foreign-policy front, meanwhile, the Croatians lost their patience with the increasingly aggressive and populous homesteaders and were denying entry to Liberland. Croatian police apprehended all Liberlanders who attempted to enter. Jedlicka was arrested and thrown in jail twice.

As a resilient type and an incurable optimist, the President was prepared to forget the various diplomatic affronts, and he quickly came to view the situation with Croatia in a positive light. He had learned from his extensive experience with social media that all attention is good attention and that even no attention could still be considered, at the very least, some attention.

‘‘If they help us, they help us,’’ he calmly explained to his ambassadorial team in Paris, which, along with most of his international supporters, took a rather dimmer view of the Croatian question than he did. ‘‘If they ignore us, they help us. If they harm us, they help us.’’

What further ballooned the President’s spirits amid the national conflict was the great pneuma of world solidarity. Within just a few weeks, he had received, via the Internet, more than 330,000 applications for citizenship. He had posted the citizenship application online in two parts, an initial registration and a subsequent questionnaire. The questionnaire asked if the applicant had a criminal history; if he or she was in debt; was respectful of the property of others; was interested in investing money in Liberland; was a member of an extremist group; if he or she wanted to reside in Liberland itself, and, if so, how. About 40,000 of the initial registrants filled out the entire questionnaire. Final citizenship, for the moment, remained in Jedlicka’s hands, and by June he had awarded only about 130 of what he was referring to (pending constitutional confirmation) as honorary citizenships, mostly to those who showed the greatest commitment to the cause. Liberland was, after all, a tiny nation; he feared his experiment would implode under the weight of too many citizens right away.

The President imagined that the majority of freedom-loving interest would come from those seeking greater freedom in general, as opposed to political freedoms in particular, so he had not necessarily expected that the overwhelming interest in his nation would come from North Africa and the Middle East. The greatest number of registrants — 82,167 — came from Egypt. After the Egyptians, the most represented were the Turks, who almost certainly included Syrian refugees; after that came Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. The Czech Republic was seventh, followed by the United States. Then it was Iraq and Jordan. Jedlicka was both proud of this fact and slightly troubled by it. Still, his first principle was that Liberland should stand for the free movement of persons — with the exception of neo-Nazis, communists and convicted felons — as well as goods and capital; the question of political asylum, like many other small details of refined governance, could be safely worked out down the line, once the land was delivered from Croatian tyranny.

Jedlicka proclaimed that in Liberland ‘‘government will be banned except for three things: security, legal stuff and diplomacy.’’ His more specific platform was in constant flux, as he fielded suggestions and emendations from his supporters, but the pillars of his libertarianism were minimal government, complete privatization of schools and health care, voluntary taxation in the form of crowdfunded state expenditures and cryptocurrency. On some issues, he felt that more discussion was needed before he could divine the proper position. There was, for example, the matter of immigration. On the one hand, the President believed in the free movement of people; on the other, he understood that many fellow libertarians and euroskeptics believed that unrestricted immigration, particularly by economic migrants and refugees, placed too great a burden on a community created to beget wealth. On this and similar questions, he left the door open to spirited debate.

Before any of these questions could be addressed, however, he had to advance Part 1 of his plan for establishing Liberland as a sovereign state: namely, to gain physical control over the territory. This had already proved more perplexing than anticipated. The Croatians regarded Liberland as Serbian territory; if you crossed overland, from the Croatian side, you were thus performing an illegal international crossing outside an official border checkpoint. If you crossed by water from the Serbian side, the Croatian police were technically arresting someone for crossing from Serbia to Serbia. The L.S.A. decided that mass arrests would inevitably bring international attention to the Croatian infringement on Liberlandian sovereignty, but the President knew firsthand the discomfort of the Croatian prison, and he did not want any more of his future citizens to suffer there. His tactic would be diplomatic, and he had to that end sought an alliance with a Czech member of the European Parliament. If the Croatian police arrested the holder of a diplomatic passport upon debarkation, they would provoke an incident with global repercussions; Liberland was a voluntary signatory to various international treaties and charters, and the Croatian provocation would not go unnoticed. The diplomat, Tomas Zdechovsky, a Czech member of the European Parliament, had agreed to the mission, which was to be held on a weekend in early June. The diplomat would attempt a landing at Liberland — which for a month no Liberlandian citizen or supporter had done without immediate arrest — and see if the Croatian police were willing to subject themselves to the scrutiny of the international community.

3. The Diplomatic Mission

The first diplomatic mission to Liberland convened at the Prague airport’s old Terminal 1. The flight would be aboard AIR-Liberland, which was not a state asset but a private enterprise contracted to provide regular air service to the Croatian castle city of Osijek, about 20 miles overland from Liberland. Jedlicka had secured, by virtue of this arrangement, a lifetime of free personal transit on the airline. For him, the gesture comported with the dignity of his office, but to his detractors, it recalled the kind of crony capitalism that Liberland had been invented to circumvent.

Though not vain, the President is a man of probity, always conscious of the freshness and propriety of his appearance, and he wore a pressed azure suit with a slight shine; the diplomat wore a blazer with a sewn-in pocket square in maroon and blue. Zdechovsky describes himself as a politician, crisis manager, media analyst, author and poet; he is an acquaintance of Jedlicka’s from the bruising small-town politics of central Bohemia, where they campaigned against each other in the last European parliamentary elections.

The aircraft was given an approach to Osijek over Liberland itself, and the President took a series of selfies with the sandy beach of Liberty Island, a soft crescent in the waters just off Liberland proper, in the background. It was his personal favorite geographical feature of his country. When he thinks of its sucrose shores, which had been host to his early presidential cavorting and now lay just beyond his reach, he is often moved to comment that ‘‘Liberland is not just a tax paradise, it is also a paradise of a sort.’’

On the drive from Osijek to the Croatian border checkpoint, Jedlicka fielded more than two dozen calls, answering each one with the phrase, ‘‘Yes, this is the president.’’ Many of his contacts had never reached a head of state with so little intermediatory fuss. The President had more than a hundred messages via at least six apps to respond to and had to restart his phone more than once when its circuits needed cooling. He had left his own reserve battery on AIR-Liberland, so he borrowed a white power brick from a Canadian-Slovak named Vince Pillar, one of the President’s growing cadre of assistants, who moved through life in a cloud of sweet banana-chocolate vape exhaust; the cable was too short, so Jedlicka had to hold both the brick and his phone to his ear to talk. We drove by the land entrance to Liberland, which for weeks was blocked by a compact white police car.

After about an hour, Jedlicka’s entourage arrived at the Liberlandian base camp, a sagging military tarpaulin stretched into a tent over a little field half-cleared of brambles on the Serbian side, about two miles upstream from Liberland itself. There were engine problems with Liberland’s official boat, so the mission was delayed until another boat could be made available. On the far side of the river, 850 yards away, the peaks of squat orange-roofed Croatian houses crouched behind a large defensive embankment were visible. The thick berm had been built to protect against the river’s flood season, as well as the mosquitoes that bred without regulation in the bogs. As we waited, someone shooed one of the wild boars, a prodigious sow running impressively free of governance, back into the thick brush.

In the distance we could at last spy a small metal dinghy speeding north from Liberland toward the camp. The men and women from the boat hopped ashore, the tallest of the five waving a Liberland flag the size of a bedsheet. He was a tall man of considerable bulk, with long, thick hair swept back underneath a fraying straw cap and a Guy Fawkes beard. He wore a thin white short-sleeved dress shirt with an open collar and a Rolex tight around his wrist; at his collar’s notch he wore a gunmetal medallion, with bas-relief imagery of a skull wearing a top hat alongside a gun. This was Niklas Nikolajsen, the director of the Liberland Settlement Association.

A Danish software engineer who now describes himself as a Bitcoin broker, Nikolajsen founded the L.S.A. just days after Jedlicka declared the establishment of Liberland. He was suspicious of the President’s self-declared presidency and decided to stake his own claim. The L.S.A. was incorporated in Switzerland as a limited-­liability company, but it had quickly matured into an autonomous faction of political hooligans that now rivaled the President’s authority.

Nikolajsen lived in Zug, a small mountainous canton of Switzerland. He paid a tax rate of only about 4 percent, perhaps one of the lowest rates in all of Europe. But what if, Nikolajsen asked himself, ‘‘you could even improve on that?’’ This wasn’t just a selfish thought, though he wouldn’t mind paying no taxes; it was also about all of those people who for some reason couldn’t live in Switzerland. ‘‘If you’re sitting somewhere nice, you think, Well, you could spread freedom,’’ he said. The idea had particular appeal in the context of the Balkans, where a byzantine regulatory apparatus allowed for a flourishing lawlessness. ‘‘In many European languages, when things are really bad and bureaucratic, you call it ‘Balkan conditions,’ and there’s a reason for it,’’ Nikolajsen said.

Despite the fragile entente between the President and the L.S.A., there were undercurrents of soft-power maneuvering on both sides, and the threat of schism remained. Earlier that month, the L.S.A. posted an aggressive piece on its website titled ‘‘Liberland’s Constitution: Is It Libertarian Enough?’’ It subtly undermined Jedlicka at every turn, suggesting that he might not be as freethinking as advertised. Where the President had wanted a clause prohibiting public assembly that infringed upon the rights of others, the L.S.A. worried this would be used as a way of ‘‘squashing protests.’’ More alarming, the President seemed to imply, in an article relating to the denial of gun permits to the mentally ill, that there might be any procedure at all to license firearms. The L.S.A. objected, along similar ideological lines, to Jedlicka’s provision that the poor might have the right to gratis legal representation.

Nikolajsen understood that the real promise and the real threat of Liberland was as a libertarian free-for-all: the Croatians feared an armed redoubt of brothels and meth labs, and they were right to worry. ‘‘I created a hundred thousand shares of the company,’’ he bragged to me. ‘‘I sold them all out to investors in the first 40 hours. Everybody wanted a piece. I never sold anything so fast. That’s when I knew this was serious. You can always trust a market. You can’t trust yourself, you can’t trust your mother, but you can trust a market, because it shows you that what you have is something everybody wants.’’

4. The Policija

At last the first diplomatic mission was ready to begin. Nikolajsen turned to Zdechovsky, the diplomat, as the company prepared to walk down to the boat, and admitted something that must have lingered uncomfortably in the minds of many freedom-loving settlers: ‘‘I have often been euroskeptic. But today I am totally for the European Union!’’

With the official state vessel out of commission, the small metal dinghy had to fit eight people. It theoretically had a maximum capacity of six, but the President found he was unable to say no to the four teams of documentary filmmakers who didn’t want to miss such crucial footage. The diplomat unwrapped four containers of kebab, chop and sausage, and laid them out attractively on very thin paper plates. The party picked at the food while waiting for a young Austrian in a blood-lettered shirt of a band called Ulcerate, a recent arrival Jedlicka hadn’t yet met, to inflate a rubber raft for use in a landing.

Nikolajsen stood on the shore, eyeing the raft grimly. He knew that the Croatian police would seize it as part of their ongoing campaign of punitive asset forfeiture. He and the President have profoundly varying notions about what might constitute a libertarian state, but they share an appreciation for national pageantry and its props. He called out, ‘‘We’ve been losing two flags and two rubber boats a day.’’

The President looked to Nikolajsen. ‘‘Can we have a flag?’’

‘‘If you promise to give it back.’’ Nikolajsen fingered his gunmetal medallion and bit his lower lip. ‘‘It’s my last one.’’

The President reassured him. ‘‘I have more in my bag.’’

The diplomat, an official of ambition delighted to be at the center of this special and unprecedented mission, swept his hand across the meat. Its grease had soaked through the paper plates and onto the weathered wooden bench. The aroma of the patties had the distinct ranginess of horse. ‘‘Do you want something to eat?’’ he asked.

The dinghy set off at speed downstream, with the President and the diplomat in the stern taking turns at the rudder. They could barely see anything in front of the boat for all of the filmmakers and photographers, and they had to swerve so as not to hit the concrete pylon that supported the border bridge. The boat quickly slowed, however, and Jedlicka looked back to find that the raft trailing behind on its leash was filling with loden green river water.

The President sighed. He looked down at his textured brown oxfords, polished just this morning and now caked in gray mud. He and the Austrian hauled the raft up into the dinghy, where it rested between two filmmakers. He shrugged and regained his good cheer, throwing his arms up in anticipation of victory. ‘‘These are the obstacles creating a new nation!’’

The dinghy came around a bend in the river, the sun lower in the sky and the light a soft violet on the green width of the river, and the President stood up and laid his hand on the raft to take in the sight of his country. He had studied the poses of George Washington, whose likeness in oil graced the official Liberland Facebook page. Jedlicka beached the dinghy on a small sandbar just north of the Liberland-Croatia border. Black scathing cumuli of mosquitoes formed a needling vapor in the boat.

Jedlicka took the pump and reinflated the raft, which had gone soft in the dinghy. ‘‘This,’’ he said, ‘‘is how presidential work is done in the field.’’ His azure suit was soiled with sludge, and when he wiped the sweat from his brow, his hand emerged striped with black arthropod entrails and jags of the blood of his face.

There was a flurry of activity on the boat. With the raft back in the water and out of the way, all assembled could see before the dinghy, on its starboard side, a white boat with a blue tarp and antenna equipment. In clean blue lettering stenciled on the side, the boat identified itself as Policija. A man in a blue uniform and blue cap gazed at the dinghy through binoculars. A second policeman worked the radio on the bridge. The President stood up and waved. The boats drew up beside each other, and their bows plinked lightly.

The President spoke amiably. ‘‘We’re sending a diplomat now to measure our borders.’’

The diplomat said, ‘‘I am from European Parliament.’’

The policeman was impassive. ‘‘What are your intentions please?’’

‘‘Now?’’ the President asked. The policeman nodded. ‘‘We send diplomat to measure borders.’’

‘‘I will warn you,’’ the policeman said, repeating some lines in English. ‘‘Everyone who steps on the right side of the river will be arrested. This border is not defined. It is in dispute. Croatia defines one way, Serbia other way.’’

The diplomat got involved. ‘‘You must respect my mandate. There is European law here.’’

‘‘We are not here to discuss with you,’’ the police official said. ‘‘Everyone will be arrested.’’ He hesitated, then pointed at the diplomat. ‘‘Except you. Your diplomatic passport protects you. We will inform our minister, and he will inform your home state.’’ The policeman seemed glad to be rid of these sentences.

The two boats continued to slowly circle each other amid the squalls of mosquitoes. The diplomat boarded the raft, with one of the documentary filmmakers, and they set off toward the Liberlandian bank, a gently sloping mud beach under a low canopy of dense foliage. The President started the engine and swung the dinghy, now much lighter, toward the center of the river. The two policemen tied their boat to a tree and went ashore.

The Austrian was encouraged. ‘‘They’re busy on the shore. We can go to Liberty Island and plant flag.’’",REAL
Ramiro Gomez’s Domestic Disturbances,"‘‘A beautiful day to be in the park,’’ he said, by way of prefacing a careful deconstruction of the scene before us. Of course it’s also a workplace, he continued, since a good 80 percent of the adults here, as in most parks on Los Angeles’s affluent Westside at this time of day, were working — gardening, groundskeeping, nannying — and most of them were Latino. In fact, this particular park held special significance for him, because it was the place he himself would bring a pair of twin toddlers most afternoons a few years back, during the two and a half years when he was working as their live-in nanny.

He went on to speak with considerable nuance about the dynamics of work in the park — how, for example, so much of the innate child-handling talent on both his own part and that of his fellow nannies had come from the way they were all reared in extended families in which everyone had to care for everyone else all along, families from whom many of these women had effectively exiled themselves for years in order to send money back home. ‘‘But on the other hand,’’ he continued, with his typical precision, ‘‘that’s why so many families in a town like Hollywood need nannies; this is a place to which all these aspiring people set out on their own, seeking their fortunes, leaving their own birth families far behind, such that when they in turn start having kids, they don’t have aunts or grandmothers to call on, and they have to hire alternatives.’’

He described the strangeness of a situation in which you were thrust as a sort of public persona (‘‘the nanny’’) into the most private inner sanctum of your employers’ lives, treated at times almost like part of the family, though at other times decidedly not. You would be expected to lavish all this love on the children (and really, children being children, how could you help doing so?), and yet you could be dismissed on a moment’s notice, on a whim, as happened to others all around you all the time, without so much as an explanation to them or to you. Although in that, he went on, your situation would not be that different from that of your employers, who were likewise expected to lavish their passion on projects from which they, too, could be dismissed without cause at a moment’s notice, especially here in this town. All of which added to the strange blurring of lines you kept running up against.

Jay’s own mother and father came from different parts of the countryside south of Guadalajara and west of Mexico City, though they didn’t meet until after they’d both arrived, separately and without proper documentation, in San Bernardino. (‘‘My father,’’ Jay explains, ‘‘is more Anglo-looking — more Spanish, as they say — my mother more mestizo, and quite beautiful’’). He eventually landed work as a trucker, she as a school janitor. They wed in 1985, and Jay came along the next year, followed by two sisters. Jay was a middling student at school: He didn’t much like to read, and he hated classroom assignments, but from early on he excelled in two areas. The first was art, but even more consuming, throughout his youth, was a passion for soccer, which he played with such panache and authority that he was steadily approaching professional caliber, except there was a problem: He was a hemophiliac. It wasn’t so much that he would get cut and bleed out; rather, he would get bashed and bleed internally, bruises that wouldn’t heal, seepages that would wend their way painfully into his joints. He regularly ended up in the hospital, but as soon as he was out, he’d throw himself right back into the game, his only concession being an ever-more-evasive running style, designed to avoid collisions, that rendered him all the more formidable as a player — that is, until, inevitably, he collided once again.

The entire soccer passion might also have been a sort of compensation for another aspect of his being. For as long as he could remember, he’d been drawn to other boys, a tendency frowned upon by his traditional Mexican family. With the passing years, as the attraction didn’t seem to be something he could change, he felt himself more and more to be an outsider, a hypersensitive observer. Toward the end of high school, he went through a goth phase, and when, on the eve of graduation, his father discovered photographs of him all decked out in mascara and lipstick, things grew very tense indeed. (‘‘Everyone was screaming and crying, it was terrible.’’) But that battle seemed to clear the air, and to some degree tensions subsided after that. A few years later, when Jay first met Feldman and began regularly going downtown ‘‘just to hang out,’’ the family gradually, fitfully, came to terms.

The subject of Jay’s sexuality brought the conversation around to David Hockney, and a whole other set of concerns rose to the fore. ‘‘Because I’ve been worried this whole time,’’ Jay said, ‘‘that if he happened to hear about my pieces, he might think I was putting him down or something. And it’s not like that at all. Hockney was always a hero of mine, ever since I began to hear about him in high school: not just the paintings, which I loved, but especially the completely natural way he dealt with his sexuality from the very start, and his example meant the world to me when I was lost out there in San Bernardino. I never intended my pieces to be sendups; they’re homages, and I just hope he would know that.’’

Well, I suggested, why don’t we just go up to his place and see? As it happens, I myself have spent some 30 years sporadically interviewing and writing about Hockney, and in fact I’d been visiting with him a few days earlier and suggested I might want to bring up a young artist for him to meet. I called him on my cellphone, and sure enough, he invited us up.

As we drove to Hockney’s place in the Hollywood Hills, Gomez told me about the first big trip he took with Feldman, back in 2012. They started in London, then headed to Paris, but to hear Jay tell it, the trip proper only really began in Barcelona, at the Picasso Museum, where he was flooded by one epiphany after another, in particular by a room devoted to showing how, later in his life, Picasso engaged with his own master, Velázquez. From there Jay and Feldman drove westward to Bilbao, arriving just before the Guggenheim there closed for a long weekend; there, he found himself in a big touring Hockney retrospective, and ‘‘was reminded all over again,’’ he said, ‘‘about how much that work really mattered to me, and it continued to hover in the back of my mind throughout the rest of that trip and, as it turned out, well beyond.’’ From Bilbao, Feldman and Jay traveled on to Madrid, where the highlight proved to be the Prado, which as far as Jay was concerned came down to one single painting, before which he stood mesmerized for hours: ‘‘Las Meninas.’’ ‘‘The scale, the composition, everything,’’ Jay explained. ‘‘But the thing that really got to me was how Velázquez, who could have painted anything — he was the principal court painter after all, the most revered artist in the country — chose to paint that, chose to portray them: the help, the princess surrounded by her nannies.’’

We pulled up at Hockney’s place, and he greeted us at the gate and escorted us into his studio. Now in his late 70s, he was clearly in another one of his own prolific phases, having recently returned to Los Angeles following the better part of a decade spent back in Yorkshire, and he was taking fresh stock of his friends here: Dozens of freshly painted portraits lined the walls.

What really leapt out at me, though, was the way that right there amid images of all the visiting dignitaries and collectors and friends and fellow artists and models were renderings of Hockney’s own two housekeepers, Patty and Doris. It did not seem to be any sort of statement. Rather, as has always been the case, Hockney simply portrays whoever happens to be around, his constant subject being his own lifeworld.

One of Hockney’s assistants now called us over for tea, and Hockney established himself in the infinitely sat-upon chair from which he often studied his paintings in progress at the end of a busy day, and Jay sat down beside him, pulled out an iPad and proceeded to walk him through some of his pastiches. Far from taking offense, Hockney seemed charmed and increasingly absorbed. He regaled us with stories of what it had been like for him when, almost the same age as Jay, he discovered Los Angeles for the first time. Stopping at one image in particular, a swath of bright green lawn across which Jay had inserted a Latino gardener pressing a big power mower, Hockney noted how in the original the image’s subject had been the sprinklers (‘‘I know,’’ Jay concurred, ‘‘I know’’). Coming from northern England, Hockney had never seen such a thing. ‘‘Amazing place,’’ he recalled thinking, ‘‘where when it rains, it rains from the ground up!’’ Hockney smiled at Jay’s version of his collectors portrait and regaled us with tales of the evident tension between the couple at the time he was portraying them (they’d eventually divorce). At one point, when Jay rose to get a closer look at one of Hockney’s recent portraits, Hockney leaned over to me and whispered, ‘‘He’s obviously very gifted — he knows exactly where to place the figures, and his color sense is spot-on.’’ Jay came back and showed us a suite he’d recently undertaken using postcards from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, onto which he’d overpainted his images of custodial workers. One was a Hockney abstraction; a dark-skinned housekeeper on her day off stood before it, purse slung over her peasant blouse, studying the painting in absorbed, perhaps quizzical, silence. ‘‘That was one of my early homages to Cubism,’’ Hockney said. Jay replied, ‘‘I know.’’

Jay’s work, too, is steeped in reference and homage, and not just to Hockney. His magazine pieces teem with allusions to Millet’s ‘‘Gleaners’’ and Manet’s ‘‘Olympia’’ (‘‘American made, internationally admired’’ reads the legend at the head of one magazine ad for a luxury sofa, atop which Jay has spread his housemaid, cleaning bucket by her side, indulging in a subversively languorous work break). When, shortly after his return from his European trip and still Velázquez-besotted, Jay was invited to contribute a piece to a Beverly Hills benefit for cancer research, he responded with a life-size cardboard cutout painting (another of his signature media) portraying the infanta from ‘‘Las Meninas,’’ in full princess regalia, flanked by contemporary Latina nannies, primping and pampering and seeing to her properly resplendent presentation — a particularly trenchant piece of agitprop, given how 6-year-old girls in Beverly Hills regularly do get treated like spoiled royalty.

Jay would be the first to admit that he is far from the first artist to have trained his eye on ‘‘the help.’’ Besides Velázquez, Manet and Millet, you need only think of Chardin’s housemaid, Degas’s laundresses, van Gogh and his potato peelers (though there the subject is more poor people who are themselves too poor to have any help), Vermeer’s milkmaid and the whole range of Dutch genre scenes. But apart from the fact that such prior instances usually deploy their domestic subjects in the service of other wider agendas (the erotic in the cases of Manet, Chardin and Degas, often archly moralizing allegories in the case of the Dutch genre scenes — Vermeer being an exception here), such previous work usually partook of the sort of thing the literary critic William Empson, back in the ’30s, anatomized as ‘‘versions of the pastoral’’: work by members of one class, directed to members of the same class, knowingly played out against the backdrop and in a stylized version of the idiom of a lower class (Elizabethan idylls, the Ancien Régime vogue for daintily dressing up as shepherds and shepherdesses). But the class dynamics, in Empsonian turns, are completely upended in Jay’s work, both in terms of who is doing the addressing and even, finally, in terms of who is being addressed.

A few months after our visit to Hockney, Jay told me he was heading to Mexico City, where his dealer Charlie James would be featuring his magazine work at the gallery’s booth at Zona Maco, one of Latin America’s most prestigious art fairs. I decided to tag along, and so did Feldman and Feldman’s father, who joined us from Philadelphia. For my own part, I was curious to see whether the Mexican 1 percent, which is to say its collecting class, might not cotton as readily as United States collectors to Jay’s depiction of Mexican-American life north of the border: not so nice, not so much what they necessarily wanted to spend their time pondering or identifying with.",REAL
President Obama’s Letter to the Editor,"Photo

For the cover story of our Aug. 2 issue, Jim Rutenberg wrote about efforts over the last 50 years to dismantle the protections in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the landmark piece of legislation that cleared barriers between black voters and the ballot. The story surveyed a broad sweep of history and characters, from United States Chief Justice John Roberts to ordinary citizens like 94-year-old Rosanell Eaton, a plaintiff in the current North Carolina case arguing to repeal voting restrictions enacted in 2013. The magazine received an unusual volume of responses to this article, most notably from President Barack Obama.

I was inspired to read about unsung American heroes like Rosanell Eaton in Jim Rutenberg’s ‘‘A Dream Undone: Inside the 50-year campaign to roll back the Voting Rights Act.’’

‘‘We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union. ...’’ It’s a cruel irony that the words that set our democracy in motion were used as part of the so-called literacy test designed to deny Rosanell and so many other African-Americans the right to vote. Yet more than 70 years ago, as she defiantly delivered the Preamble to our Constitution, Rosanell also reaffirmed its fundamental truth. What makes our country great is not that we are perfect, but that with time, courage and effort, we can become more perfect. What makes America special is our capacity to change.

Nearly three decades after Rosanell testified to her unbroken faith in this country, that faith was vindicated. The Voting Rights Act put an end to literacy tests and other forms of discrimination, helping to close the gap between our promise that all of us are created equal and our long history of denying some of us the right to vote. The impact was immediate, and profound — the percentage of African-Americans registered to vote skyrocketed in the years after the Voting Rights Act was passed.

But as Rutenberg chronicles, from the moment the ink was dry on the Voting Rights Act, there has been a concentrated effort to undermine this historic law and turn back the clock on its progress. His article puts the recent push to restrict Americans’ voting rights in its proper context. These efforts are not a sign that we have moved past the shameful history that led to the Voting Rights Act. Too often, they are rooted in that history. They remind us that progress does not come easy, but that it must be vigorously defended and built upon for ourselves and future generations.",REAL
How ‘Rock Star’ Became a Business Buzzword,"Photo

Once, a long time ago, a rock star was a free-spirited, convention-flouting artist/rebel/hero/Dionysian fertility god who fronted a world-famous band, sold millions of records and headlined stadium concerts where people were trampled in frenzies of cultlike fervor. Someone who smashed guitars, trashed hotel rooms, developed Byzantine drug problems and tried to mask evidence of his infidelity with the strategically applied scent of breakfast burritos. Despite what his ‘‘Behind the Music’’ episode would invariably reveal, a ‘‘rock star’’ — or the Platonic ideal of a rock star — was not just a powder keg of charisma and unresolved childhood issues, but a revolutionary driven by a need to assert the primacy of the self in an increasingly alienating commercial world.

Now, 60 years, give or take, since the phrase came into existence, ‘‘rock star’’ has made a complete about-face. In its new incarnation, it is more likely to refer to a programmer, salesperson, social-media strategist, business-to-business telemarketer, recruiter, management consultant or celebrity pastry chef than to a person in a band. The term has become shorthand for a virtuosity so exalted it borders on genius — only for some repetitive, detail-oriented task. It flatters the person being spoken about by shrouding him in mystique while also conferring a Svengali-like power on the person speaking. Posting a listing for a job for which only ‘‘rock stars’’ need apply casts an H.R. manager as a kind of corporate Malcolm McLaren; that nobody is looking for a front-end developer who is addicted to heroin or who bites the heads off doves in conference rooms goes without saying. Pretty much anyone can be a ‘‘rock star’’ these days — except actual rock stars, who are encouraged to think of themselves as brands.

This bizarre transposition goes back to the turn of the millennium, when the idea of a ‘‘creative class’’ was popularized in books like Paul H. Ray and Sherry Ruth Anderson’s ‘‘The Cultural Creatives: How 50 Million People Are Changing the World’’ and Richard Florida’s ‘‘The Rise of the Creative Class,’’ which argued that innovation would drive growth in the 21st century. The creative class, according to these thinkers, valued the cool things in life. More than money and status, they cared about authenticity, activism, ecology and the interconnectedness of all things. They were more egalitarian, more into personal growth. Whereas the popular business literature of the 1980s urged managers to imagine themselves as fierce, merciless warriors (Sun Tzu’s ancient treatise ‘‘The Art of War’’ was required reading for many American executives and business students), by the end of the century, consultants at McKinsey had declared a ‘‘war for talent.’’ Business writers in the new millennium reconceptualized men in suits (or hoodies) as social revolutionaries.

According to a 2013 study in The Human Resource Management Review, ‘‘talent,’’ in its new usage, could refer to qualities, like natural ability and technical mastery, or it could refer to talented people, as in a subset of elite, superskilled workers, or it could mean all people, no matter how untalented. On the HBO show ‘‘Silicon Valley’’ (in which, in a recent episode, a pretty event manager introduced the benightedly dorky programmers Dinesh and Gilfoyle as ‘‘rock stars’’ to her sexy, unimpressed stunt man boyfriend), Nelson Bighetti, known as Big Head, is a prime example of this last category. Big Head is an inept app developer whose swift rise through the ranks of his company, Hooli, makes no sense to his colleagues — which of course it shouldn’t, because it’s all just part of a cynical legal strategy. But Hooli, a very loose spoof of Google, is a faith-driven ‘‘culture’’ led by a ‘‘visionary,’’ Gavin Belson. To doubt his talent for spotting ‘‘talent’’ would border on apostasy. Belson is a ‘‘rock star,’’ and Big Head becomes a rock star by association. ‘‘Silicon Valley’’ nails this particular lexical puffery: the way that language can create power in the most ridiculous, illogical ways. Rock star ad absurdum.

Rock stars themselves bear some responsibility for the creation of brand ‘‘rock stardom.’’ In her book ‘‘No Logo,’’ a study of the effects of advertising on culture, Naomi Klein traces the inversion of artists and corporate wage earners to the 1980s, when seemingly every ’70s rock star who survived youthful hard living into hale middle age entered into a synergistic alliance with other, bigger brands. Comeback concert sponsorships, commercial licensing agreements, lucrative advertising contracts and co-branded merchandising opportunities offered the aging rock star, drifting into irrelevance, advantages only a die-hard romantic and well-funded idealist would turn down: a final, global victory lap; an extra couple of hundred million in the bank; and a shot to trade enshrinement in a specific era for an eternal, ahistoric, ever-fungible brand ‘‘relevance.’’

Who could blame him? A person can sanely assume a countercultural stance only when there is a culture to counter — and by the 1980s, there wasn’t one anymore. Advertising permeated popular culture so thoroughly that it essentially replaced it. This oddity is illustrated by the successful co-opting of the Beatles’ song ‘‘Revolution’’ as the soundtrack to a 1987 Nike commercial. The Beatles sued the sneaker company, the company that created the ad and EMI-Capitol Records for $15 million, claiming that they did not ‘‘endorse or peddle sneakers or pantyhose.’’ This sounds comically innocent now. Now we’re at the point where it seems perfectly normal to see the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards as the face of Louis Vuitton luggage; last year, Bono announced, while performing at the launch of the Apple Watch, that U2’s album ‘‘Songs of Innocence’’ would be automatically released for free to the accounts of as many as 500 million iTunes users — a great many of whom were evidently not U2 fans. Complaints about the rock star’s attempt to glom onto the launch and about the sullying of the pure Apple brand experience ensued.",REAL
The Pleasure of a Steak at Home,"Photo

After staring at the bill for a ridiculously overpriced and not very good rib-eye at a famous steakhouse in Chicago — replete with a sauce so banal it may as well have been ketchup, and served with attitude, too — I remembered I could do better at home. I went to my local butcher (which in my neighborhood just happens to be called the Local Butcher Shop) and paid $60 for a glorious, two-inch thick, fat-laden rib-eye. The plan was to blow the minds of three guests with a piece of meat so good it needed no sauce — and then pair it with sauces that were irresistible on their own.

Sixty dollars may sound like a lot of cash for a piece of meat, but if it’s local and well raised, with better flavor, texture and karma than cheaper commodity beef, it’s worth it for a table of four. While the idea of creating a one-night steakhouse at home may sound self-indulgent, it’s also unreservedly fun, and as you do the work yourself, the final bill is actually pretty tame.

Because I don’t cook 100 steaks a day, I knew I’d have to be careful not to ruin this gorgeous slab. I grilled it, although if I’d cooked it in a pan, my method would have been similar. It’s actually possible to achieve nicely cooked meat, with moderate portions of everything from rare to medium in one steak, using two unusual but easy techniques I’ve refined through years of mistake-making.

One thing I’ve learned is that when you cook a cut that’s more roast- than steak-size, you cannot just blast away over direct heat. If you do, the outside will burn, the meat near the surface will quickly become overdone and the center will remain raw. Instead, you want to use low heat to do most of the work for you, and then accelerate to the searing stage to form the kind of crust for which people overpay in steakhouses. There are a few steps involved in doing it the right way, requiring a certain amount of patience and (unless you’re a pro) an instant-read thermometer, but both equipment and time are minimal.

You might think sauce is overkill with a cut like this — and you could indeed opt for only a beautiful olive oil, some lemon and a shower of salt — but then you’d have only half a blowout. Playing steakhouse chef means dreaming up the accompanying sauces that you’d most like to see on the table. I took a handful of old favorites and updated them with the most contemporary ideas I could think of. My favorite is what I call ‘‘blue butter,’’ a blend of blue cheese and butter, about which one of my friends said with a sigh, ‘‘I wish I didn’t know about this.’’

I’m glad I do. With the sauces made and the steak purchased and readied earlier that day, the last-minute prep for this meal was well under an hour. I grilled corn along with the steak, mixed a vinaigrette for the salad and sliced tomatoes. Then I sliced the steak and served it family-style with a chilled light red wine. No one seemed to miss the haughty atmosphere, and this midsummer feast would have been cheap at twice the price — and still less than the steakhouse bill for two.",REAL
How Do I Handle the Towel Saga Next Door?,"Photo

On Easter Sunday, we always have an egg hunt for our neighbors and the children of our Hispanic housekeeper and yard man. This past Easter, our next-door neighbor invited the kids to swim in their pool afterward. In July, a full three months later, we received an email from our neighbor stating: ‘‘Would you mind reminding your housekeeper that they have a large portion of my swimming towels, I was terribly short this weekend. Hope you had a great Fourth of July.’’ This was the first we heard of missing towels. We did not want our housekeeper to think that we or our neighbor thought the children had taken towels that did not belong to them, so we made the decision to purchase 12 towels and give them to our neighbor. We wrapped them up and left them with a note — ‘‘A little surprise for your generosity.’’ A week later, we found the box of towels with a note back at our door — ‘‘I cannot accept these towels and cannot keep them because it is morally as wrong for me to take your towels as it was for your housekeeper’s children to keep my towels.’’ We do not think the children were morally wrong in intent; they simply did what kids do when getting out of the pool — dry off and then wrap in a towel before piling into cars to go home. Had we known about the towels, we would have collected them at the time, but three months after the fact changes how we think the towels should be regarded. The cost of the towels is not really an issue for us or our neighbors. Should we have tried to retrieve the towels from several families before buying new ones? We are almost certain that our housekeeper was not even aware the children were given towels, as she was at our house the entire swim time cleaning up from the meal. Our effort to replace the towels was meant to defuse the situation, not continue into a towel saga. NAME WITHHELD

Kenji Yoshino: ‘‘Saga’’ immediately suggests that it might be time to wind down your relations with your neighbor. You behaved in a perfectly magnanimous way, and your neighbor reacted in what might at best be called a punctilious, or even supercilious, manner. I’m reminded of how much of ethics is about letting the little things go. It seems as if your neighbor is completely unwilling to do so — both in asking for towels that were lent out three months ago and also in not embracing your offer. We need a little more give in the joints to ensure one another’s human flourishing. A truly ethical posture requires the generosity of mind and spirit that accepts the intent for the deed in a case like this.

Amy Bloom: This should probably serve as a reminder to all of us not to go overboard making sure that you cling desperately to the high ground. This is just appalling to me, especially the tone of ‘‘I cannot accept these towels.’’ Really? You cannot? It seems to me that the wish here is not to be moral; the wish is to be insulting. There may be some issues of race and class here as well. I’m sorry to say I’m now imputing all sorts of terrible things to the punctilious and supercilious and frankly rude neighbor. I hear all of this in a particularly Dame Maggie Smith tone: ‘‘I was terribly short this weekend.’’ You did a lovely thing, you tried to respond graciously and there was no insult in your offer.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: I disagree slightly, not with what you said about the neighbor — who sounds like a prig, and if he or she were my neighbor that would be it, we would not be socializing very much anymore — but I do think it probably is a good idea to take this up with your housekeeper. After all, without talking to her, you have absolutely no idea whether the claim that the children were involved is even true, and she might want to do something about it. The assumption that she’ll just be embarrassed, which might be true, somehow doesn’t treat her fully as a responsible person. She might think, Well, I should tell these children that when you go to somebody’s house and they lend you towels, you return them.

Bloom: It occurs to me that for all we know, the towels are moldering in the basement or wherever the kids changed into their clothes. So if you’re going to ask the housekeeper, ‘‘Hey, did you notice a pile of extra towels when the kids came home from the pool three months ago,’’ I can appreciate that being somewhat uncomfortable. It would also probably behoove the letter writer to check all of the rooms in the house and make sure there’s no little pile of towels left behind.

Yoshino: I also want to say that if there was an objection to the housekeeper’s behavior, the neighbor should have taken it up directly with the housekeeper rather than involving you, given that you’re her employer. He or she could have asked for an email address. If you are going to be put in the middle, he or she should not fault your constructive gesture.",REAL

One striking element of the accusations surrounding Bill Cosby is that he is said to have told a modeling agency owner that he was looking for broke, out-of-town models, basically targeting the most vulnerable people he could find.

Still, there’s always people who want to date models and be attached to models. When I was first in New York, I lived in a models’ apartment, and one day I answered the phone, and these guys were like, ‘‘Hey, wanna go out, you wanna party?’’ And I was like, ‘‘Who is this?’’ It turned out these guys had the number to the apartment, and they would just call models to go party.

"Rescuing Wildlife Is Futile, and Necessary","‘‘We feel responsible,’’ says Norma Bishop, executive director of Lindsay Wildlife Experience in Walnut Creek, Calif., which operates America’s oldest wildlife rehabilitation center, founded in 1970. ‘‘It’s a little like the story of Noah rescuing the animals.’’ Rehabbers stress that their animals are never pets, and their role is to return them to the wild as fast as possible, but they inevitably forge emotional bonds with their charges. British regulations permit individuals to tend to animal casualties themselves, provided they adhere to established welfare guidelines. In America, wildlife rehabilitation is confined to licensed experts, often working for charitable institutions. Whatever a person’s position, the dedication involved is immense: Keepers of orphaned elephants in Kenya, for example, must sleep next to the animals every night, taking turns with others because too great an attachment to any one keeper risks the baby elephant being overcome by grief when he or she takes the night off.

Why do people rescue wildlife? The eminent veterinarian John Cooper told me he thinks ‘‘there’s something inside humans when they’re faced with a helpless creature. We have an imperative. A duty.’’ Bishop agrees: ‘‘I believe most people, especially children, simply cannot see an animal suffer.’’ The Lindsay rehab center receives everything from bobcats to snakes, ducklings to songbirds, brought in by concerned members of the public who have driven many miles to deliver them. Terry Masear, a hummingbird rehabber in Los Angeles, writes that rescuing animals draws out ‘‘raw emotions that unleash our deepest insecurities about our humanity, mortality and place in the natural world.’’ These insecurities can drive mistaken attempts at rescue: Most ‘‘lost’’ fledgling birds in trees or sleeping fawns in long grass should be left well alone, for they are still being fed by their parents.

Rehabbers have been criticized for being too sentimental, their activities dismissed as acts of compassion for individual animals with little or no conservation benefit. It’s a reasonable view, but it misses the point. It’s hard to feel a meaningful connection with creatures that are distant silhouettes in summer skies; staring into the eyes of a swift from a few inches away turns it into something much easier to love. The way that rehabbers talk about what they do evokes in me precisely the feelings I’ve had about rescue animals in my own life: an intoxicating process of coming to know something quite unlike you, to understand it well enough not only to keep it alive but also to put it back, like a puzzle piece, into the gap in the world it left behind.

Wakelam has no truck with accusations of sentimentality when it comes to swifts, whose numbers in Britain have fallen by more than 35 percent over the last 20 years: Each swift may truly be precious to the species’ fortunes. People are increasingly blocking up holes in the eaves of old buildings where swifts traditionally nest, and modern buildings often have nowhere for swifts to nest at all. A similar problem faces chimney swifts in North America as defunct and crumbling chimneys are removed. Many people do not know about the swifts’ reliance on our buildings because they simply do not know that they are there. Seeing a rescued swift can change all that.

‘‘Once people have seen a swift in the hand, they are in awe of them,’’ Wakelam says. Her kitchen is full of cards from well-wishers and people who have brought her swifts, and rescuers drop by to see how their chicks are faring. Some of them are motivated, like Wakelam, to fit swift nest boxes under their roofs.

The wind has dropped, and the sky above the house is a widening pool of blue. Wakelam puts seven swifts into a paper-towel-lined pet carrier, and we drive to her favorite release site, the village cricket field. A match is beginning. After brief, good-natured negotiations, the cricketers stop their game and watch as Wakelam takes a swift from the box, plants a quick good-luck kiss on its feathery crown and holds it high in the air on her outstretched palm. It looks like a weird, unearthly creature, a delicate construction of scalloped feathers and ungainly wings: hunched into itself, its miniature claws gripping her fingers, it has deep eyes that look like reflective astronaut visors. I wonder what it can see: lines of magnetic force, perhaps, rising air and flying insects and the suspicion of summer storms. The flat green beneath it has nothing to do with it at all.

It stares into the wind. Then it starts shivering. Nothing has visibly changed, but something is happening. On Wakelam’s open palm a creature whose home has been paper towels and plastic boxes is turning into a different creature whose home is thousands of miles of air. It is as extraordinary a thing to witness as a dragonfly larva’s crawling out of the water and tearing itself out into a thing with wings. Then the swift decides. It hunches itself forward on its wings and drops from her flattened palm. ‘‘Up! Up! Up!’’ calls Wakelam. I’m terrified it will hit the ground. But it does not. For five or six seconds it flies with halting, unaccustomed wing beats a foot above the grass, then hitches and pulls into gear and starts to ascend, flickering upward until it becomes a remote pair of winnowing wings among all the other swifts up there. For weeks it has sat in a plastic box preening and snuggling with its foster siblings. Now it is gone, and Wakelam’s hand is its final memory of earth, the last thing it will touch for two years.",REAL
Personal (Search) History,"Photo

One afternoon, riding the bus in downtown Montreal, Madelyne Beckles swiped open her phone to browse the web. She caught sight of her most recent mobile searches — ‘‘Snooki diet,’’ ‘‘Miley Cyrus’ sex tape,’’ ‘‘Bruno Mars songs’’ — and found this collection to be absurd but unexpectedly poignant: an unvarnished glimpse into the meanderings of her mind. Beckles, a 23-year-old visual artist whose work explores her relationship to technology, took a screen grab and shared the image on Instagram. This became the genesis of her newest project, called Herstory: Every so often, Beckles pulls up her mobile search history and saves it with a screen shot. In one image, ‘‘Labiaplasty’’ is listed right above ‘‘Bethenny Frankel Instagram.’’ In another, ‘‘Dirty martini’’ appears a few searches before ‘‘Who owns the Mona Lisa.’’ (To preserve the integrity of the project, she says she deletes only items with typos.) Some of the images appeared in a recent art book called ‘‘Babe’’; the rest will appear, in the form of large poster-size prints, as part of a show in a Toronto gallery called Autumn later this month.

Beckles says she likes how this public display of her innermost thoughts, represented by her search terms, conveys an uncomfortable truth: that we are rarely as sophisticated and erudite as the versions of ourselves we publish online. ‘‘It is what I have actually searched, and it is how my mind works,’’ she said. She described viewing the images as ‘‘opening an underwear drawer of thoughts.’’

Beckles’s work is much more than a digital diary of her thoughts, though. She captures the perversity that characterizes most of our relationships with the Internet. We obsess over our self-presentation on social media, while constantly leaving traces of our true selves elsewhere, often without even realizing it. Call it ‘‘dark data’’: the trail of information collected by companies like Amazon, Seamless and Uber about what we really do in our free time, about our splurges and snack preferences — all those unsharable details that we rarely boast about on our feeds. On the surface, Beckles’s images reveal the inner workings of a woman who casually coasts between high and low culture. But underneath they serve as an expression of the sheer volume (and utter inanity) of the secrets we show to Silicon Valley’s all-seeing eye.",REAL
The Island of Decades Before,"‘‘I really think it will be a beautiful journey,’’ Nev said, misusing that adjective as usual.

Unfortunately, he didn’t factor in the chance that a desperate man would react to his breakup with a woman by jumping in front of our train — which she was driving. Later the news reports told us the whole story: The 36-year-old died instantly when the train driven by his ex-girlfriend, the West Highland Line’s first female driver, hit him at Inverlochy, just outside Fort William.

As for us, sleep-deprived, confused and with five children in tow, we were shepherded onto a coach that took us through the Scottish Highlands. I couldn’t help wondering, tragic though the situation was: Would we miss our ferry? It was the only one of the day. And there was nowhere to stay in Mallaig.

Nev remained hopeful. ‘‘If we have faith in Shiv Baba,’’ he said with a wide-eyed wiggle of the head as the children joylessly chomped on the last of his carrot-and-hummus sandwiches, ‘‘everything will be fine.’’

We missed the ferry, of course.

My wife, with the forcefulness only a woman faced with the prospect of sleeping rough on the Scottish moors can display, called the train company and demanded that it charter us a boat. And it did.

An ogre in overalls met us at the harbor. He thrust a plastic gallon of whisky in Nev’s direction. When Nev explained he was teetotal, the ogre grunted, ‘‘What business does a man who doesn’t drink have on Eigg?’’

You could see what the ogre meant. Much of Eigg’s sparse population gets through the harsh winters, when light appears for only a few hours each day, as well as the long summer nights, when the place becomes dreamlike, the same way: with a flowing river of McEwan’s lager. Still, he delivered us to our destination.

Over the next week we climbed the Sgurr, explored caves and spotted two nesting golden eagles, while in the evening Nev demonstrated how 30 years of meditation and spiritual study had made no difference whatsoever in his ability to lose at Monopoly.

Mum discovered for the first time in many years what it was like to share a house with kids. She developed an obsession with her grandchildren’s leaving pools of water on the floor after they had a shower, until we figured out that she herself was the culprit.

At night, when the kids were asleep, we talked about the macabre beginning to our vacation. I realized that, despite everything we’d been through, despite the shadow of suicide hanging over us, it was good to be together with all these peculiar people — from the nondrinking yogis to the ogres in overalls.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Uzbek,"Photo

Four years ago, the federal government paid me a large sum — a year of graduate-school tuition, plus a stipend — to study Uzbek at the University of Chicago. Uzbek is among the least commonly taught of the so-called Less Commonly Taught Languages, or L.C.T.L.s. So uncommonly is it taught, in fact, that without federal largess it would hardly be taught at all. Because I happened to speak decent Turkish, a cousin of Uzbek, and because I spent a week in Uzbekistan when I was 22, and because life is nothing if not a sequence of odd choices vaguely considered, for two years I sat in a room with two other students and produced some extremely literal translations.

Uzbek is a member of the sprawling Turkic-language family, which comprises­ around three dozen members in six major branches. As in any human family, there are varying degrees of affinity: If Uzbek and Turkish are cousins, Uzbek and Uyghur, which is spoken in western China, are fraternal twins. But Turkic grammars and numbers are surprisingly uniform, and it is theoretically possible for someone to buy milk in Sevastopol (Crimean Tatar) or Ashgabat (Turkmen) or Bishkek (Kyrgyz) using more or less the same words.

Turkic grammar is among the most logical of any language family, a fact that has occasioned racially charged appreciations throughout history: ‘‘It seems strange that a language elaborated by the rude and nomad tribes of Central Asia,’’ wrote the British explorer Robert Barkley Shaw in his 1875 ‘‘Sketch of the Turki Language,’’ ‘‘should present ... an example of symmetry such as few of the more cultivated forms of speech can boast.’’

Uzbek makes life easy by forsaking both articles and gender. It is agglutinative; pieces are tacked onto one another, each component retaining its individual meaning. Nouns come first, and verbs come last. ‘‘Nice to meet you’’ is a multisyllabic benediction: Siz bilan tanishganimdan xursandman (‘‘You + with + meeting-my-from + happy-I-am’’). And like all Turkic languages, Uzbek has the marvelous, hedging grammatical feature of evidentiality — a signpost meaning ‘‘I didn’t see it myself but understand it to be the case.’’

Useful Phrases

“Unfortunately, I don't speak Uzbek very well”: Afsuki, O'zbek tillni yaxshi gapirmayman.



“Tashkent is beautiful this time of year”: Bu mavsumida Toshkent juda ciroyll.



“Excuse me, where's the lavatory?”: Kechirasiz, hojatxona qayerada?



“The dog (evidently) ate my homework”: It uy vazifamni yegan ekan.

It can be difficult to talk about Uzbek without soaring into Orientalist flights. ‘‘O warbling beauty of the steppe!’’ I started to write, like a 19th-century lady traveler. Uzbek is the main inheritor of the Chagatai language, which with Persian was used in the great courts of Samarkand and Bukhara, Silk Road cities that have long represented the inscrutable East in foreign imagination. The history of Turkic languages is tied inextricably to the history of Islam, and thus with Arabic and Persian (both from different language families). Uzbek in particular is packed with Persian — important words like farzand (child) and jon (soul) and xudo (god) — and employs its commanding vowels; salom (‘‘hello’’) requires you to make the roof of your mouth high and round, unlike the flat ‘‘a’’ of the Arabic salaam. The plucking nasal ‘‘qa’’ and a gravelly ‘‘g’a’’ add a lovely burbling quality to rapid-fire Uzbek. It does warble.

The grammar is simple, but the history is complex. National borders can be risibly at odds with reality, especially in Central Asia, where Turks, Mongols, Persians and others roved and mingled, where ‘‘Uzbek’’ was, for a time, more of a descriptive antonym of ‘‘Tajik’’ — no­­madic versus settled — than an ethnic classification. Later, the Soviets complicated things with mass reorganizations of their Central Asian subjects. The question of whether there is mutual intelligibility among Turkic languages is not simply a linguistic matter but an ideological one, at the core of nationalist movements that have formed and reformed across time and empires. Some of this history is manifest in YouTube comments; an Uzbek pop song often prompts a pan-Turkic greeting from a member of a Turkish fascist party.",REAL
How to Brush a Gorilla’s Teeth,"Photo

Even 400-pound silverbacks will fear a toothbrush. ‘‘You have to desensitize them,’’ says Jodi Carrigan, the lead keeper of primates at Zoo Atlanta, which is home to the largest collection of gorillas in North America. At first, place the toothbrush at a safe distance, somewhere out of reach but visible. Every day, inch it closer until you can hold the brush in your hand while you teach the gorilla to open its mouth. To do this, reward it with grapes, slices of apple, popcorn or juice (Crystal Light is an ape favorite). The first time an animal completes the desired behavior, ‘‘jackpot’’ it, offering 10 grapes instead of one. ‘‘Then they’re like, ‘Oh, whatever I just did I should do it again,’ ’’ Carrigan says.

Wild gorillas eat mostly plants and have fewer dental problems than more omnivorous species like chimpanzees, which consume fruits, nuts and animal protein much as cavity-riddled humans do. Scientists have found that animals undergo distinct morphological changes in captivity; some species grow larger skulls, for example, while others get more cavities. Captive gorillas live as much as 20 years longer than their wild counterparts too, reinforcing the need for a basic dental-hygiene regimen. At Zoo Atlanta, willing gorillas have their teeth brushed several times a week, and dentists are on call to drill out decay and perform the occasional root canal.

After a gorilla holds its mouth open on cue, introduce the brush. ‘‘Start with the incisors,’’ Carrigan says. ‘‘Slowly work your way back to the canines and then the molars.’’ Don’t force it. Keep extra toothbrushes at the ready: They will be grabbed, tossed, chomped on. Use only fluoride-free toothpaste; training a gorilla to spit is not worth the trouble. Some apes accept brushing within days; others resist for months.

Carrigan encourages the gorillas in so-called motherese, the same cooing, high-pitched intonation she uses with her own small children. In fact, when her children started getting their milk teeth at around 8 months, she schooled them to obediently open their mouths too. ‘‘I used the gorilla training method,’’ she says. ‘‘Now my kids are really good at brushing.’’",REAL
‘More Than Once’,"Photo

So much depends on the precision of language. In this seemingly plain-spoken poem, ‘‘tears’’ suggests not only a literal image but also an abstract one. In that trick the eye plays on the mind, I see at once the rips in the fence and a glimpse at the emotion such a crossing — ‘‘a little dangerous’’ — can engender.

I have crossed the border by going under the fence,

Crawling through one of its many tears.

This is no news:

People cross this way every day.

For us who lived there it was a game

But for those passing through, it was a life.

Once, I sat on the cement footing,

The fence pulled up enough for me to sit there,

Its wires in my hands, and — in that moment —

I felt the fence as an instrument.

My fingers strummed it, tried to play it

But no music came forth. No song.

The wires were too stiff, with no give.

It would not be a guitar, no mandolin.

It simply made the dull rasp of a fence

Bothered, rough on the fingers,

A little dry,

A little dangerous.",REAL

RE: VOTING RIGHTS ACT

Jim Rutenberg wrote about efforts over the last 50 years to dismantle the protections in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the landmark piece of legislation that cleared barriers between black voters and the ballot. The story surveyed a broad sweep of history and characters, from United States Chief Justice John Roberts to ordinary citizens like 94-year-old Rosanell Eaton, a plaintiff in the current North Carolina case arguing to repeal voting restrictions enacted in 2013. The magazine received an unusual volume of responses to this article, most notably from President Barack Obama.

If Democrats want to frighten their party’s base into thinking Jim Crow is on its way back, they’ll have to do better than arcane disputes about voter ID or early-voting laws. ...

One of the greatest victories of the struggle for civil rights was the way it transformed the white South from a bastion of racism to one in which racial equality was taken as a given. Race exists as an issue in the America of 2015, but comparisons with 1965 aren’t merely misleading, they are flat-out falsehoods. That is especially true in the South, where blacks vote and hold office in numbers that are largely commensurate with their share of the overall population. ...

But for liberals, a mythical war on voting rights must be invented if they hope to hold onto the White House next year.

A strengthened Voting Rights Act should start with this proposition: When the state has no good reason for making it harder for people to register and vote, doing so should be illegal. If we can get Congress to acknowledge this fundamental point, we won’t have to worry about parsing racial or partisan intent, and voters throughout the country will be protected. Voting rights will be protected without having to prove Republican racism. ... I’m not holding my breath that this will happen anytime soon, but a colorblind amendment to the act seems like the only path through a Republican Congress to adding voting-rights protections for the next 50 years of the Voting Rights Act.

The Kansas Experiment,"As many tax-cutting states have found later on, the party’s deep-seated opposition to tax increases of any kind can make balancing the budget a high-wire act. In Alabama this year, the state’s Republican governor, Robert Bentley, vetoed a bill from the Republican-controlled statehouse that would have removed $200 million from the state’s budget, including 5 percent cuts for Medicaid, prisons and the state’s department of mental health. Instead, he called the Legislature into a special session and asked for more than $300 million in new taxes.

The situation in Kansas was just as dire, if not more so. Brownback began the year by cutting education in the face of the state’s budget crisis, but he also proposed that legislators raise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol. The new taxes were part of an effort to close a staggering gap for fiscal 2016, estimated at $650 million in January, or more than 10 percent of the state’s $6 billion general fund. More urgent, the state still needed to cut about $300 million from this year’s budget as, month after month, tax revenues continued to arrive well below expectations. In January alone, the state took in $47 million less than anticipated. As Brownback saw it, these new taxes on consumption were necessary so that his priority — the march to zero on income taxes — could proceed.

Uncle Gene is not an architect of the march to zero, but he supports it, and he is one of the legislators in the Kansas statehouse who has helped to enact it and to preserve it. He is the vice chairman of the Tax Committee in the Kansas House, and he also sits on the Appropriations Committee. There are more important figures — the speaker of the House, the Senate president, the leaders of the Tax and Appropriations Committees in both houses, for starters — in the statehouse, but Gene is in the next tier. He’s one of the people whose support the governor usually relies on to get something done, according to Tim Shallenburger, Brownback’s legislative liaison and a former speaker of the Kansas House.

I called Gene in January, as this year’s legislative session began in Topeka. For a Kansan, and a Suellentrop, Gene is a talker, but if you met him you would probably find him a little bit reserved, although not taciturn. On this call, he sounded worried. ‘‘People are leaving Kansas,’’ he told me. The state has no mountains and no beaches, and thousands of jobs that were lost during the Great Recession, especially in Wichita’s aircraft industry, never returned. The march to zero, which includes an already-passed provision that exempts the owners of 330,000 businesses and farms in Kansas from income tax, was designed, Gene said, to turn Kansas into a different sort of tourist attraction. As he and his fellow conservatives see it, it’s an ‘‘open for business’’ sign, one they hope will draw free enterprise to the state, perhaps akin to the way the national debate over the expansion of slavery once drew young abolitionists from New England to the plains. At the very least, they hope it will prevent young people and existing businesses from moving elsewhere, to places with ski lodges or surf shops.

A couple of weeks later, I landed at the airport in Kansas City, Mo., and drove an hour or so west to Topeka, where Gene offered to be a sort of Virgil on my tour. He would introduce me to the principals in the state’s budget negotiations in the hope of highlighting what he called ‘‘a different philosophy’’ of how to make a state’s government revenues match its expenditures. I’ve spent much of my life moving between America’s two political territories — between places like Topeka and places like Washington, Boston and New York — and generally found that neither knows much about the other beyond caricature. For my part, I hoped to be able to reveal Gene and his colleagues as something other than the monolith of monsters and morons that they’re so often taken for in the political conversation, perhaps out of disregard for the moral disagreements that underlie the American political divide.

When you report for The New York Times, you’re sometimes told never to forget that your last name is ‘‘of The New York Times.’’ Topeka may be the only place I’ve covered where my birth name opened more doors than my professional surname. ‘‘Welcome home,’’ Gene said when I met him during the first week of February, as the state was struggling even to find the cash to pay its bills that month. The next day, I encountered Mark Dugan — Brownback’s campaign manager during a tough re-election fight in 2014, a victory that conservatives perceive as a referendum on, and a mandate for, the march to zero — and he stretched out his hand and said, ‘‘Great to meet you, cuz.’’ Dugan is now a lobbyist for, among others, the anti-tax organization the Club for Growth. He and I had never met, but our families are close and our grandmothers are sisters. During a meeting that week with Susan Wagle, the Senate president, she smiled and said, ‘‘You’ve gotten around pretty well with that last name.’’ When I protested that I was on assignment for the newspaper of record, she looked around at her staff and asked, ‘‘Would we have had time for someone who didn’t have the last name Suellentrop?’’

There were actually five Suellentrops roaming the statehouse on my third day in Topeka — me; Gene; my father and my uncle Charlie, both of whom drove in from the Kansas suburbs of Kansas City to visit; and my uncle Frank, the president of the family bank, who came up from Wichita for a gathering of the Kansas Bankers Association, which Brownback addressed. As I pondered whether we should start a lobby, Charlie, who works as a corrections officer, began volunteering political advice. ‘‘You have to get out there that you’re not anti-teacher,’’ he told Gene, referring to the plan to reduce a court-imposed spending increase on education. ‘‘I know you’re not. But that’s what they’re going to say.’’ He added, ‘‘Right behind me live two teachers, and my God, they just hate Brownback.’’

As a child and as a young adult, I always found Gene to be an affable if extremely opinionated guy. Uncle Gene in Topeka was not all that different from Uncle Gene in Colwich, although perhaps he had less hair. Even in his 60s, he cuts a boyish, blue-eyed, baby-faced figure in the statehouse. He’s far from flashy, but he has been known to depart from the monochromatic navy suits that dominate Topeka as they do Washington. He speaks in a slow baritone, not the reedy twang of many rural Kansans.

I followed him for a few days in February as he mixed with legislators and lobbyists. ‘‘This is one of our business-friendly legislators,’’ a Walmart lobbyist said as he clapped Gene on the back. ‘‘He gets it. Free-market guy.’’ (Walmart is not always popular in western Kansas, where even some conservatives blame it for hollowing out small towns by putting small grocers and others out of business.) A lobbyist for McLane, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, fretted about the effect of higher cigarette taxes on company-owned convenience stores along the Missouri border. Gene brainstormed with Dave Trabert, the president of the small-government Kansas Policy Institute, about whether there was a way to isolate the administrative costs in the state education budget, so Republicans could cut them without reducing classroom spending. My uncle would stiffen a little, though, if local reporters approached. He gave direct but clipped answers to their questions.

On the morning my father and Uncle Charlie were in town, we ran into Topeka’s most powerful figure, who presides over the statehouse like a school principal. Sam Brownback favors sweater vests and ties and can often be found sipping from a coffee mug under the rotunda, as he was this day, near a ring of the eight ruling flags that have variously flown over Kansas going back to the 15th century. He is modest in demeanor, flat almost to the point of dullness. This explains why The New Republic once described him as ‘‘diminutive,’’ even though his height approaches six feet. When I met him a month later at Cedar Crest, the governor’s residence in Topeka, he served me tangerines that he peeled and set out on a ‘‘Toy Story 2’’ plate.

His affect makes him easy to underestimate. In the past four years, Brownback has remade the Kansas Republican Party in his likeness. The party’s once-powerful moderate wing has withered after steep losses in consecutive primary elections, the main battleground where policy is determined in a one-party state. In 2011, the Kansas House welcomed 33 new Republican members, and then 40 more in 2013, a turnover of more than half the body in just a few years. The Senate’s moderate Republican president, Steve Morris, was ousted in 2012 with Brownback’s support. It has been a striking transformation for a state party long associated with a more cooperative approach to politics. Bob Dole, who after Dwight Eisenhower is the most revered politician in Kansas, told Al Hunt of Bloomberg View this spring that his proudest political accomplishments were passing the Americans With Disabilities Act and brokering a 1983 compromise to rescue Social Security through benefit cuts and tax increases. Brownback takes great pride in the bipartisan humanitarian agenda he pursued as a United States senator — he and Barack Obama once wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post criticizing the Bush administration’s policies in Darfur — but it is impossible to imagine him trumpeting, as Dole did, entitlements and regulations as his political legacy.

That day, Brownback was stewing over a basketball loss his undergraduate alma mater, the Kansas State Wildcats, had suffered against the Kansas Jayhawks, the more popular, more successful, more glamorous team in the state.

‘‘It just went according to script,’’ he complained — and it was slow and boring, to boot. My dad chimed in that K-State liked to play that way: a tough, physical, not always aesthetically pleasing style.

Brownback nodded. It was clear that he preferred to be the scrapper. ‘‘When you’re fighting a gazelle,’’ he said, ‘‘the best thing to do is step on her foot.’’

The one constitutional requirement of the Kansas Legislature, as everyone in Topeka will tell you, is to produce a balanced budget. The Legislature arrives in January each year, works for 90 days, give or take, and then essentially goes home until next year. Lawmakers earn roughly $18,000 for the session, although much of that is allotted for gas and hotel rooms.

The budget itself, at least in broad strokes, is not a complicated document. About half the state’s spending goes to K-12 education, with another 12 percent or so given to the state’s public colleges. Around 20 percent goes to Medicaid, some more to pensions for teachers and state workers. Add those numbers up and you get a budget that’s relatively inflexible, even for a governor and legislature eager to cut it.

But in the details, especially when facing a sizable deficit and no easy new cuts in spending, the process can get technical. Here in Topeka, the biggest question at the outset of the 2015 legislative session — after, you know, ‘‘Can Kansas pay its bills?’’ — was whether Brownback could preserve one of the most controversial elements of his 2012 tax cut: the zero-income-tax policy for the owners of businesses structured as ‘‘pass-through entities,’’ mostly S corporations and limited-liability companies. Brownback calls this the ‘‘small-business accelerator,’’ and it was conceived in consultation with Arthur Laffer, the Reagan-era economist and godfather of supply-side economics. Government revenues plummeted. In fiscal year 2014, which ended about a year ago, Kansas took in almost $330 million less than it had anticipated, almost 6 percent below the estimates of the state’s nonpartisan experts. According to Pew, at the end of 2014 only five states had experienced declines in tax revenues for three consecutive quarters: Alaska, Connecticut, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Kansas. Moody’s cut its debt rating for Kansas in April of last year. ‘‘It’s like going through surgery,’’ Brownback told The Wall Street Journal at the time. ‘‘It takes a while to heal and get growing afterward.’’

Brownback’s devotion to his tax cuts would make it difficult, if not impossible, for him to live up to a second goal he had set for his administration: increasing spending on education. If tax revenue was going to continue to fall, the budget for ‘‘K-12’’ (as everyone referred to it, as if it were a mountain in the Himalayas) would have to fall a little, too. Tim Shallenburger, sounding a lot like Rahm Emanuel after Barack Obama’s election in 2008, told me that the budget crisis in Kansas created an opportunity for conservatives to repeal the state’s school-finance formula, which he called the last still-standing Democratic achievement in the state. Brownback himself, mixing metaphors, said it was ‘‘the key to the Rubik’s cube that will solve it.’’ As he put it during an interview in his office in the statehouse, ‘‘Major on the majors, not on the minors.’’

In early March, the results of the back-room negotiations over school financing were announced at a news conference by the leaders of the budget committees for the House and Senate. The plan essentially froze spending for school districts for the next two years while loosening the rules for how districts could spend what money they did get. It repealed the formula that the state had used for more than two decades to allocate money to districts, which was based on enrollment, property values, the number of special-needs students and other factors. Republicans pledged to create a new formula, one that emphasized outcomes and student achievement over ‘‘Suburbans for superintendents’’ — Suburban-driving superintendents being, in Kansas at least, the 21st-century equivalent of Ronald Reagan’s Cadillac-driving welfare queens. But they gave themselves two years to figure it out.

A week after the news conference, the bill was passed on the floor of the House, and within 12 days it was the law of the land. Putting aside the merits of the formula or exactly how many dollars each school district needs, the vote was significant because — despite being a Republican achievement — it effectively guaranteed that the Legislature would need to raise taxes before the session was over. The House and Senate, before repealing the formula, restored tens of millions of dollars in cuts that Brownback had taken from schools in February.

Just holding education spending nearly flat required extraordinary measures in the House, where the vote fell one shy of the 63 needed to pass a bill. This led to a ‘‘call of the House,’’ a motion that requires each legislator to remain seated while state troopers, at least supposedly, scour the state for missing members. Two hours later, a couple of members of the House showed up and voted yes, and the call was lifted.

The bill cut roughly $50 million from schools, a figure that conservatives asserted could be made up by consolidating administration and back-end operations like payroll, especially in smaller districts. Critics of the cuts described them in apocalyptic language as the dismantling of public education in Kansas. Mark Tallman, a lobbyist for the state’s association of school boards, told me both sides were telling the truth. Schools would be getting more money than they received in 2014. But that accounting relied on a contentious tactic: lumping teacher pensions, previously a separate item, with each school district’s budget. (Those pensions may reflect the full cost of employing a teacher, and thus be fairly considered a classroom expense, but making that determination while holding the line on spending could dent school operating budgets.) Also, on a practical level, the legislators had clawed back money that the districts expected to receive, and had already allocated, for this year.

Won’t even supporters of smaller government, I asked several conservative leaders in Topeka, complain when jobs in their communities are lost? Wagle, the Senate president, smiled and said dryly, ‘‘There will be lots of complaints.’’ Ty Masterson, the chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, said districts needed to ask themselves: ‘‘Am I holding this position because I need this position? Or am I holding this position because I want to employ this person?’’ Gene put it this way: ‘‘Well, how much government do you want?’’

That same week, I went to see Brownback at Cedar Crest, the governor’s residence, days before the Kansas Jayhawks and Wichita State Shockers were to play each other in the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament. He was in a playful mood.

‘‘Did you get tickets to Omaha?’’ he asked. ‘‘Your dad couldn’t get that for you? Your Uncle Gene? C’mon!’’

Lucy, his 3-year-old puggle, wandered about. His foyer was littered with luggage and a backpack that his daughter had left there, right before falling asleep upon her return from a Colorado ski trip. Brownback went into the kitchen — where the page-a-day Scripture calendar was 12 days behind schedule — to get a drink and the tangerines. We sat in his cavernous living room, beneath a Birger Sandzén landscape. He drank Coke from a Glory Days Pizza souvenir cup and kicked his shoes off and left them by the fireplace. He was relaxed, close to manspreading.

A lot of people in the statehouse, I said, seemed to be talking past one another during the education debate. ‘‘Isn’t it delightful, though?’’ Brownback replied. ‘‘After being at the federal level for so many years — you never had this sort of interaction. Because it’s so big, it’s so hard to change. You send up a trial balloon, you’re likely to get killed with it yourself. But here, things just pop up all the time.’’

One thing I liked, I said, was that there weren’t a lot of staff members to deal with. Nothing against staff, I added, looking at Eileen Hawley, Brownback’s communications director, who was in the room with us.

‘‘You’re right,’’ Brownback said. ‘‘You’re dealing with principals. That’s why I like standing out in the hallways, a lot of days. See who walks by. Because I can do half a dozen meetings just standing there. Gene walks by with a tax idea and I can say: ‘You know, I’d have a real problem with that. No, nothing against you, I don’t like this one.’ See the next guy, on the education formula: ‘Yeah, I really want to encourage you about that.’ I can do that all day long. You don’t have to set up a meeting, go to a guy’s office, have four people watching. You just deal with it right there, in the hallway.’’

The best part, he said, was simply that. ‘‘It functions,’’ he said. ‘‘You lack that functionality, federally.’’

The moderates and liberals probably don’t think Topeka is all that functional, I pointed out.

‘‘Well, maybe too functional,’’ he said.

When I met Ray Merrick, the white-haired, mustachioed speaker of the Kansas House, he handed me a copy of ‘‘Ray’s Rules,’’ a document he gave to each Republican member of the House when he became speaker a couple of years ago. Emblazoned with an odd crest — consisting of a bear in front of a maple leaf (Merrick was born in rural Alberta) beneath crossed rifles and above the Latin words Rem Publicam Probare, which can be translated as ‘‘Examine the State’’— the diploma-like paper lists only two rules. Rule 1 is to always ask yourself: ‘‘Are my efforts addressing job creation and the economy? Are they shrinking the size of our state government while providing essential services and expanding liberty? If not, why am I doing it … why are we doing it?’’

The second of Ray’s two rules seemed especially relevant: ‘‘It is our responsibility to be successful under conditions as we find them … not as we would like them to be.’’ Brownback’s dream of a state unburdened by income tax was not in itself unreasonable: Seven states, among them Florida, Nevada and Texas, get by without one. But eliminating a tax that generates about 40 percent of your state’s government revenue is a lot harder than never imposing that tax to begin with.

And economic reality was failing to cooperate with the governor’s expectations. Brownback, after signing the tax cuts in 2012, pledged that they would act as ‘‘a shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy,’’ a metaphor that called to mind an image of the governor astride a dying state, like John Travolta atop Uma Thurman in ‘‘Pulp Fiction,’’ preparing to deliver a gleaming needle to the chest. In an op-ed article in The Wichita Eagle, Brownback made the cuts sound magical, suggesting they would create tens of thousands of new jobs, bring tens of thousands of new people to the state, leave more than $1 billion in the bank accounts of taxpayers and even ‘‘directly benefit our schools and local governments’’ by expanding the population and the economy.

The money, or a good chunk of it, did stay in Kansans’ pockets. But the rest of the promises have not been met, although Brownback points to the state’s private-sector job growth as evidence that his policies are working. ‘‘I think it’s just clear that the tax cuts were promoted as having these quick and strongly positive results, and they haven’t,’’ says Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at National Review and a native Kansan (he grew up about 10 miles from the house where I was raised in the suburbs of Kansas City).

In late April, after the state’s revenue estimate for the next fiscal year came in low, the Brownback administration and the state’s legislative leaders crossed their fingers and hoped that there had been some unusually large checks dropped in the mail on April 15. People who owe taxes tend to file on deadline, they noted, while people who get refunds are more likely to file early. Eventually the administration assigned additional staff members to start opening the piles of envelopes at the Revenue Department, in search of the tax-return equivalent of one of Willy Wonka’s golden tickets.

‘‘There’s some discussions now about what the heck we’re going to do for two weeks while they go through 160,000 envelopes,’’ Gene told me by phone, audibly frustrated. ‘‘I’ll know a lot more Monday about what the next two weeks are going to look like,’’ he said, adding: ‘‘Sam’s pretty upset about it.’’

No golden ticket was ever found. The consensus estimate, as reported by The Lawrence Journal-World, was that fiscal 2015 would bring in $5.7 billion in tax revenues, the lowest number since 2010’s $5.2 billion, and $700 million less than the state collected in 2012, before the tax cuts were passed. Lawmakers and the governor would need to find about $400 million, it was announced on April 20, to close the deficit for the fiscal year that would begin on July 1, in a little more than two months.

Since the beginning of the legislative session, you could divide the conservative Republicans into three camps. The first was the Cutters, who thought that the state’s budget woes should be solved solely through reductions in spending; these were the hardest of the hard-liners, and their position did not get much consideration. The second was the Marchers, who were willing to raise sales taxes and other consumption taxes but not to raise income taxes. The third I call the Do-Overs, who were willing to raise some taxes but only if changes to the 2012 income tax cuts were included. The Do-Overs especially wanted to eliminate the zero-tax policy for business owners and farmers.

Each side brought numbers as evidence for the righteousness of its cause, but it was clear that they were motivated by something deeper — a reminder, for an outsider like me who now lives in a very different political climate, that math can never really resolve a debate rooted in history, culture and values. In Kansas, the Do-Overs, who had many legislative leaders in their ranks — including Wagle, the Senate president, and Mark Hutton, the chairman of the House Commerce Committee — wanted a system that valued fairness by taxing business owners and their employees equally. ‘‘I hope I can get 63 people to put their integrity and fairness ahead of their desire to return here,’’ Hutton told me. By contrast, the Marchers, led by Brownback and including Uncle Gene, wanted a tax system that valued risk and entrepreneurialism. The two policies Brownback most wanted to preserve were his ‘‘small-business accelerator’’ and ‘‘the ratchet,’’ a statute that automatically applies revenue growth in future years to income tax cuts, before the money can be spent by legislators. Most of all, each side wanted to signal to themselves and to others that they stood for these things. At a moment when the divide between the Do-Overs and the Marchers seemed unbridgeable, a public-radio reporter asked Melissa Rooker, a moderate Republican, if conservatives were acting out of political expediency.

No, Rooker said, these are true believers. If they were merely political opportunists, the gulf in Kansas — and nationally — would not be so wide. ‘‘You could get around the political expediency,’’ Rooker said; you could come up with acceptable alternatives. ‘‘But you can’t change people’s beliefs.’’

In the second week of May, when the Legislature was scheduled to finish the work for its (supposedly) 90-day session, tax proposals began whizzing through the two chambers with the speed of text messages or tweets. They began to be marked not just with dates but also with timestamps, to distinguish them from proposals that were rejected only minutes before. The negotiations began to resemble an effort to get 63 of 97 Republicans to agree on what to put in a combo platter at a Mexican restaurant. An actual menu of 17 options was circulated by the House Tax Committee, with price tags on each proposal. Raise the sales tax by one percentage point, to 7.15 percent from 6.15 percent, and everyone could go home: It would bring in $426 million. Or raise it to 6.5 percent, make all business owners pay income taxes and impose Brownback’s liquor taxes and you would get close to the same number.

After the Marchers and the Do-Overs on the House committee failed to come up with a proposal that satisfied both sides, the two factions agreed to bring two separate bills to the House floor, and let the whole Republican Party hash it out during a full debate with unlimited amendments. One bill was a consumption-tax-only proposal that would test the depth of the support for the Marcher perspective. The other would impose income taxes at a reduced rate on otherwise-exempt business owners, among other increases.

Soon the wrangling turned to the question of which bill would go first. Gene wanted the Do-Overs to mount up and lead the charge. When their bill failed, they would resign themselves, he said, to the governor’s approach. Instead, the Marcher bill went to the floor of the House. It would be hard to find stronger circumstantial evidence that the congressional leadership had joined the Do-Over caucus. Marc Rhoades, a Marcher leader, leveled just that accusation during the floor debate. The night before, as I walked out of the capitol, I saw Mike O’Neal, a powerful Marcher ally who was the Kansas Chamber of Commerce president and the speaker of the House when the 2012 tax cuts passed. I asked him: This tax increase is going down in flames, right? ‘‘I think so,’’ he said. ‘‘Unfortunately, that’s the plan.’’

The next morning, just before debate ended and votes were about to be cast, Gene approached the lectern in front of the Kansas House and spoke in favor of the bill. Food taxes will go down, he said. Income taxes will go down. ‘‘The only one that is being increased is the sales tax, other than on food,’’ he said. This bill will address the state’s ‘‘budget-tax deficiency,’’ while maintaining ‘‘our progression to cut rates for all.’’

He sat down. Moments later, the bill failed on a voice vote so overwhelming that no one even bothered to ask for a roll call.

The Republican Party’s seemingly intractable divide on taxes would continue for the next four weeks, as the Kansas House and Senate tried to cobble together something, anything, that would get the votes — 63 in the House, 21 in the Senate and 1 (the governor) — to raise taxes and close the deficit. At one point, the Democratic leader of the Senate issued a news release that was nothing but a photograph of an underground passage and a single, mocking sentence: ‘‘There is no light at the end of the tunnel, because they can’t even find the entrance to the tunnel.’’

Finally, on June 11, Brownback made a personal appeal, a mixture of abashed pleading and brash threats. At a joint caucus of the House and Senate Republicans, in the chandeliered Old Supreme Court room on the capitol’s third floor, he said that he needed a tax increase by Monday, or he would have to balance the budget on his own, using his veto pen or his statutory authority to make the cuts himself. A line-item veto of the entire operating budget for the state’s six public universities, his budget director noted, would conveniently fill the hole.

At 4 a.m. on June 12, the 113th day of the legislative session, after a debate that began at 1:30 a.m. and included one speech explaining a yes vote that was given in a staccato, shuddering sob, the House voted to raise taxes, 63 to 45 with 17 not voting. The plan raised the state’s sales tax to 6.5 percent, from 6.15 percent; eliminated most itemized deductions for income taxes; raised cigarette taxes; and preserved a watered-down version of Brownback’s ratchet. The Senate followed suit more than 12 hours later. Democrats called it the largest tax increase in Kansas history, passed without a single Democratic vote.

Mark Hutton, the Committee on Commerce chairman and Do-Over leader, lashed out at moderates and Democrats who refused to vote for tax increases, either out of fear of losing their next election or out of a desire to campaign against Republicans for voting for them. He wrote in The Wichita Eagle after the session was over, ‘‘In the end, we had a governor, held hostage by East Coast ideologues, who would not consider a correction to his tax policy; House moderates paralyzed by fear of being ‘postcarded’; conservatives in both chambers who would have been fine with cutting $400 million from our state budget; and the Democrats in both chambers who were more interested in political gains in the 2016 elections than being part of the solution in 2015.’’

It was over, sort of. The negotiators squeezed a final concession out of Brownback, an additional $50 million in unnamed budget cuts that would be made at the governor’s discretion. Without those cuts, the budget that passed and was signed into law would leave an ending balance of little more than $30 million for fiscal 2016. Another bad January, and the state could be right back in the hole.

Threatening the truce from another side is a lawsuit before the Kansas Supreme Court over whether the Legislature’s K-12 cuts were constitutional and satisfied the legal requirement to adequately and equitably educate Kansas children. In the coming weeks, school districts would announce layoffs and program cuts. A large suburban district said it would cancel its elementary-school Spanish program. In Kansas City, just before the budget was passed, the superintendent announced a 10 percent cut to every school and department budget. NPR reported that Kansas teachers were ‘‘fleeing’’ to Missouri, with twice as many unfilled teacher jobs in Kansas — 700 — as there normally were at that time of year.

The cuts to education were real, and they have been the most controversial outcome of the budget agreement in Kansas. But I prefer to emphasize this aspect of the deal: A group of politicians decided to violate a deeply held principle to protect what they saw as the common good. In this summer of Trump, as the Republican presidential campaign reaches new nadirs of silliness, it may be hard for some to believe that conservatives in the Kansas statehouse could ever hit bottom on the amount of government that could be cut. But that’s what happened. If they could have cut spending more deeply without doing immeasurable harm to schools, to prisons, to mental hospitals, to roads, they would have done so. Over and over, they told me they didn’t run for office to raise taxes. Then they did exactly that.

Not that Uncle Gene would necessarily see it my way. He held out hope that an audit of the government by a private firm — the money to pay for it is in the 2016 budget — would find new inefficiencies to eliminate. He would also point out that the new tax increases are smaller than the historic tax cuts of 2012. ‘‘We wish to be known for an aggressive, positive business environment,’’ he told me after the vote. ‘‘Everyone else will say we’re just flyover country,’’ unless Kansas does something that makes people sit up and notice. To raise the sales tax by a little more than three-tenths of a percentage point is ‘‘palatable,’’ he said, if doing so would save the march to zero.

And the dream of zero, at the end of the day, is what buoys him and his fellow travelers, no matter how arduous the journey ahead. Barring a surprise that is outside the control of Uncle Gene or the governor — an economic boom of the likes that has yet to be seen this century, filling the state’s budget with a surplus of tax revenues that would make hard choices easy to avoid — Republicans in Kansas will almost certainly be debating again next January, and perhaps for many Januaries to come, whether the march can keep moving. To the stars, through difficulties.",REAL
The Misadventures of Issa Rae,"A few days later, Rae took me for a ride past the strip malls, drought-parched lawns and stucco houses that make up View Park-Windsor Hills, the South Los Angeles neighborhood where she spent her formative years. She bounced giddily in the driver’s seat as she reeled off a list of beloved black movies and television shows set in the area: ‘‘Boyz N the Hood,’’ ‘‘Moesha,’’ the rom-com ‘‘Love and Basketball’’ and the TV show ‘‘Girlfriends.’’ These movies and shows captivated Rae when she was young, not because they were shot near her but because they offered a glimpse of how black lives could be depicted on-screen. They felt real to her, textured, authentic creations.

Windsor Hills is also known for being among the wealthiest black neighborhoods in the country. Rae drove us by a low-slung ranch house that, from the outside, appeared to have a generous rec room, and a palatial white home that Rae said had probably been added to since she lived there. They were just a couple of blocks apart, and she spent two large, but very separate, portions of her childhood in them.

Her mother, Delyna, is from Louisiana, and her father, Abdoulaye, is from Senegal. They met while studying in France, started a family, then moved around a lot before briefly settling with their five young children in Windsor Hills in the ’80s. Adboulaye, a doctor, was working to build a pediatric clinic in nearby Inglewood. His clinic is still there, on the corner of West Manchester Boulevard and South Seventh Avenue. Rae took me by it as part of her tour, and the building bears his name in 1,000-point font: A. Diop Family Care Medical Group. (Issa Rae’s full name is Jo-Issa Rae Diop.) The family fell into an exceptionally average life, until escalating gang violence unnerved Rae’s mother. She insisted that the family relocate to Senegal, and Rae’s father agreed; living in Africa would also instill his children with discipline and respect for their heritage.

In 1988, they moved to a lavish home, kitted out with a security guard and a maid, in an upscale neighborhood in Dakar — the capital and Abdoulaye’s hometown. Rae’s father tried and failed to open a hospital there, and after about two years, the family moved back to Windsor Hills. Rae’s mother enrolled her in one of the best schools in South Los Angeles, King/Drew Magnet High School of Medicine and Science.

Until then, Rae had zigzagged between private schools, where she stood out for being black, and public schools, where she was mocked for her so-called white affectations. King/Drew was largely black and Latino, and she relished her immersion in mainstream American black culture, which until then she had mostly experienced through TV. Rae calls it her ‘‘pinnacle black experience.’’ It was also here that she began taking acting seriously. King/Drew’s drama department often staged complex and challenging narratives about race; Rae participated in a production of ‘‘On Strivers’ Row,’’ a 1939 play about class conflict among Harlemites.

Rae went to Stanford University, where she majored in African and African-American studies. She found the drama department to be bland in comparison with King/Drew’s, but she continued acting and directing outside it. Inspired by a classmate who’d written and produced a D.I.Y. hip-hop opera, Rae started working on a project of her own: a stage adaptation of Spike Lee’s ‘‘School Daze.’’ It attracted a packed house. Rae realized she liked writing and producing — as well as the feeling of bypassing gatekeepers.

A 20-minute drive from campus, in a makeshift office above a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim were developing a video-sharing website called YouTube. When Rae first discovered the site, she mostly used it to watch old ‘‘American Idol’’ clips. Soon she started to make raunchy music videos with her friends and classmates for parody songs they wrote, like ‘‘Working the V’’ and ‘‘Nani Pop.’’

During her senior year, she recruited friends to star in a soapy, low-budget mockumentary series she wrote about student life at Stanford called ‘‘Dorm Diaries.’’ The series alternated between vignettes of action and confessionals, like those on MTV’s ‘‘Real World.’’ But unlike the cast of that show, which tends to include one or two black characters per season, Rae’s actors were all black. Rae posted episodes of ‘‘Dorm Diaries’’ to Facebook, and the show quickly circulated around her campus. From there, it spread to others, like Georgetown and Harvard. Rae learned that she had a knack for portraying everyday black life — not made special by its otherness or defined in contrast to whiteness, but treated as a subject worthy of exploration all of its own. ‘‘It was a light bulb, my epiphany moment,’’ she says.

After graduating in 2007, Rae got a fellowship at the Public Theater in New York. She planned to pitch ‘‘Dorm Diaries’’ to MTV or BET. Then, one night, thieves broke into her Washington Heights apartment and stole thousands of dollars’ worth of equipment, including her laptops, camera and all of her tapes. Even her scripts and the pitch reel she was polishing for the networks were taken.

The burglary left her in debt and depressed; you can’t make movies without equipment. Still, she forced herself to attend film networking events. She found them absurd and torturous, especially for an introvert (which Rae likes to claim she is). After a particularly excruciating gathering, Rae was sitting on her bed in her apartment, drawing in her journal. She scrawled out the words: ‘‘I’m awkward. And black.’’ Rae liked the way they challenged the archetypes generally available for black people in entertainment, especially women, who are often cast as sassy, power tops, angry or motherly figures — sometimes a combination of them all — but rarely awkward. This thought process led her to create a character that, much like Rae herself, defied these stereotypes: a woman at home in her blackness, but shy, who grappled with her identity, and who loved rap music but couldn’t dance to it to save her life. This sketch became the basis for her alter ego, J, the protagonist of ‘‘Awkward Black Girl.’’

In Rae’s best-selling memoir, also called ‘‘The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,’’ published earlier this year, she writes about her discomfort with ‘‘Precious,’’ the critically acclaimed 2009 movie about an abused, illiterate, pregnant black teenager. It is punishing to watch; in one of its most vivid scenes, Precious steals and eats a bucket of fried chicken and then vomits into a trash can. Rae felt uneasy ‘‘not because I disliked the film, not because I couldn’t relate to the story, but because Hollywood was so [expletive] excited about this movie,’’ she writes. ‘‘Is that what it takes to create a sympathetic black female lead character?’’ In a sense, it is this question that has animated Rae’s short career in television writing.

One episode of ‘‘Awkward Black Girl,’’ titled ‘‘The Job,’’ encapsulates the show’s seamless blend of race politics and Seinfeldian situational comedy. On the show, J works as a telemarketer for Gutbusters, a dubious weight-loss-supplement company in Los Angeles, and in this particular episode, she cuts off all of her hair after a boyfriend dumps her. J’s boss, an older white woman, becomes fascinated with the haircut, asking a series of rapid-fire questions: ‘‘Do you wash it?’’ ‘‘Can you wash it?’’ ‘‘Can I touch it?’’ J’s eyes widen in disbelief as she fantasizes about a variety of ways to shut her up, including smushing her boss in the face and yelling ‘‘Stop!’’ Eventually, she is required to attend anger-management counseling, which allows her to grow closer to another attendee: a gentle blond man named Jay (christened White Jay by fans, a name that stuck).

Part of the sly genius of the show is that viewers are let in on J’s interior monologue — the show leans heavily on voice-over — and much of the humor comes from the tension between her self-image and the impression she makes on others, who generally struggle to reconcile all of the seemingly incongruent aspects of her identity. In one episode, after J sleeps over at White Jay’s house and borrows a clean shirt from him, a new receptionist gives J’s short Afro and baggy clothes a knowing smirk, and invites her to an L.G.B.T. support group. J scrambles to come up with a way to say she isn’t gay without causing offense, but she can’t find one, so she reluctantly accepts the invitation.

Rae grew up in the ’90s, which is sometimes called the golden era of black television. Many of the most memorable shows on TV that decade — ‘‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,’’ ‘‘Family Matters,’’ ‘‘Martin,’’ ‘‘In Living Color,’’ ‘‘Sister, Sister’’ — starred black actors and were written by black writers, and many had long runs on major networks. Some smaller networks had entire lineups that skewed black, too: Fox, UPN and the WB in particular. But this era was short-lived. Kristal Brent Zook, the author of ‘‘Color by Fox: The Fox Network and the Revolution in Black Television,’’ says that the collapse was caused by these networks tacking toward the mainstream. In the mid-’90s, Fox started to model itself after the Big Three networks. ‘‘Once they had the means to move up in the world, they didn’t need the African-American viewer anymore,’’ Zook says. ‘‘In 1994, they just canceled the majority of black-produced shows in one fell swoop.’’ UPN ended up in CBS’s portfolio and was then merged with the WB to form a new station called the CW, best known for ‘‘Gilmore Girls.’’

Black television was a lifeline for Rae, especially during a period of her childhood spent in Maryland. ‘‘When I was in Potomac as the sole black girl, these shows were my access to black culture in some ways,’’ she writes in her memoir. ‘‘When I moved to Los Angeles, and the kids said I talked white but had nappy hair, I found a sort of solace in knowing that Freddie from ‘A Different World’ and Synclaire from ‘Living Single’ were napped out, too. I could be worse things.’’ Freddie and Synclaire were free-spirited black women who could be described in many ways — artsy, oddballs, sporty, cultivators of strange hobbies and affectations — and yet were unequivocally and undeniably black.

As she grew up, Rae became disillusioned by the rise of catty reality-television tropes and token stock characters. She describes them in her book as the ‘‘extremely tragic black woman, or the magic helpless Negro, or the many black men in dresses.’’

‘‘How hard is it to portray a three-dimensional woman of color on television or in film?’’ she writes. ‘‘I’m surrounded by them. They’re my friends. I talk to them every day. How come Hollywood won’t acknowledge us? Are we a joke to them?’’

Her own show was an instant hit online in 2011, and soon a number of networks and production companies expressed interest in adapting ‘‘Awkward Black Girl’’ for prime-time TV. To Rae’s disappointment, most wanted to completely rework the show. Rae recalls a phone conversation with a network executive who wanted to make it into a pan-racial franchise operation, starting with ‘‘Awkward Indian Boy.’’ Another suggested Rae recast the lead with a lighter-skinned actress with long, straight hair — in essence, the exact opposite of Rae. She turned down the offers.

‘‘They wanted to make it as broad as possible, broadly niche, but I was like: No, that’s not what this is about,’’ she says. Another botched opportunity came in the summer of 2012 with Shonda Rhimes and Rhimes’s production partner, Betsy Beers. Rae pitched them a show called ‘‘I Hate L.A. Dudes,’’ a comedy about a woman trying to date preening, image-obsessed men in Hollywood. Rhimes and Beers loved it so much that they sold it to ABC. But Rae had trouble getting the script ready for pilot-reading season that winter. She recalls fielding constant, sometimes overlapping and contradictory notes from the network and Rhimes’s team. (Rhimes declined to be interviewed for this story.) In the end, her treatment fell short of expectations, and the pilot wasn’t picked up. ‘‘I compromised my vision, and it didn’t end up the show that I wanted,’’ she says. ‘‘It wasn’t funny anymore.’’

While Rae grappled with the pressure to dilute her sensibilities to find mainstream approval, Silicon Valley would once again intervene in her favor. The rise of digital streaming over the past few years has altered the calculus of representation in television. Broadcast networks are no longer the sole creators and distributors of shows; a vast array is being produced by media and technology companies, including Snapchat, Yahoo, Hulu and Amazon. Even premium networks like Showtime and HBO have introduced stand-alone digital products to appeal to younger viewers and have shifted their focus to making original programming — which, in the long run, may drive subscriptions. This shift allows — and encourages — the creation of bold, nontraditional programming that can be aimed at specific audiences instead of the broadest market possible.

In February 2013, Rae received a call from Casey Bloys, executive vice president of programming at HBO, who wondered if she had any other ideas to pitch. She eventually came to the network with the concept for ‘‘Insecure.’’ It’s about a woman on the brink of turning 30 who is wrestling with the onset of her delayed adulthood. She would be played by, and loosely based on, Rae.

Rae happened to share a management firm, 3 Arts, with the actor and writer Larry Wilmore, and it arranged for Wilmore to walk her through the screenwriting process. Before he joined Comedy Central, Wilmore had a hand in practically every black television show of note: ‘‘In Living Color,’’ ‘‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,’’ ‘‘The Jamie Foxx Show,’’ ‘‘The Bernie Mac Show,’’ ‘‘The PJs,’’ ‘‘Sister, Sister’’ and even the short-lived ‘‘Whoopi.’’ He spent a month interviewing Rae. They would sit for hours on his building’s rooftop in downtown Los Angeles. ‘‘I asked her what was going on in her life, what’s important to her, her sex life, what she thinks about, and we built the show out of that,’’ Wilmore says. ‘‘She had the ideas for characters, and we created a world around them.’’ They wrote the first script in eight days and revised it over the following weeks.

HBO approved the script for ‘‘Insecure’’ in December 2014. Rae was excited to hire a support staff of other nonwhite directors and producers who would be intimately familiar with the milieu inhabited by her characters. She had a wish list of people she liked — primarily young women of color — but she soon found out HBO had little interest in hiring them. Generally, an HBO spokeswoman said, the network wants people who have experience.

By this March, Rae was eager for some forward momentum but still wary of ending up with the wrong team. She knew she needed a showrunner who would be amenable to her vision and polished enough to please the networks. Chris Rock had expressed interest in directing the pilot episode of the show, but he wanted to shoot it in New York. This would have been convenient for him but would have undermined Rae’s desire to depict her Southern California home. (Rock declined to comment.) Eventually, HBO offered a promising candidate: Prentice Penny, a black showrunner with a reputation for his work on ‘‘Scrubs,’’ ‘‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’’ and the colorfully strange ‘‘Happy Endings.’’

Shortly after our conversation in her office, Rae and I drove to a gastropub in Culver City, where she and Penny were scheduled to meet. We were shown to a booth in the back of the restaurant, an industrial-chic joint with exposed steel piping. As we waited for Penny to arrive, Rae fidgeted, obsessively smoothing out her checkered button-down shirt. She was nervous; a lot was riding on the meeting. A few minutes later, Penny breezed in, looking every bit the part of a successful Hollywood writer, with the kind of dewy skin that comes from expensive moisturizers and a visibly sculpted physique beneath a fitted periwinkle shirt and stylishly tapered sweatpants.

He sat down, summoned the waiter and ordered a Manhattan. Then he told Rae that he had a message from Mara Brock Akil, the creator of the UPN sitcom ‘‘Girlfriends,’’ which gave Penny his start as a writer. When she heard that he was meeting with Rae about her show, she gave him a stern warning: ‘‘She said, ‘Don’t [expletive] it up! Get this black girl’s vision right.’ ’’ Both broke into laughter. Penny continued: ‘‘I told her, ‘That’s easy!’ ’’

Penny asked Rae where she grew up, and when she told him, his face lit up in recognition. He knew Windsor Hills well, and they played that classic Southern California name game of intersections and boulevards. Rae sat back in the booth, a beatific grin spreading across her face. ‘‘That’s the neighborhood I want to depict,’’ she said.

Rae and Penny ordered food and talked about how they’d handle some of the scenes in the treatment. In one scene, Rae’s character is dumped and goes on a bender; in another, she and her best friend, Molly, have a philosophical discussion about Marge Simpson. He told her to focus on the relationship between the two protagonists. ‘‘People will watch if Molly and Issa have chemistry,’’ he said. Penny pushed Rae to think about the vibe of her show: its look (polished or gritty?), the pace (quick cuts or slow-moving scenes?) and even the color palette (washed-out or glossy?). He said it would be important to differentiate her show from HBO’s other female-centric offerings, to increase not only its chances of being picked up for a full season but also the likelihood of a renewal for a second season. And renewal is the goal, he said — there’s no surer sign of success in Hollywood.

‘‘Insecure’’ will deal with race and cultural identity directly, so Penny encouraged Rae to think creatively about how she might portray the duality between what he described as ‘‘the internal and external Issa.’’ Despite some writers’ ambivalence about voice-over, Penny praised her use of it, especially on ‘‘Awkward Black Girl.’’ One of Rae’s strengths as a writer is her ability to wring comedy out of the peculiarity of the black experience in America, specifically what W. E. B. Du Bois called ‘‘double-consciousness’’: the sense that you’re always looking at yourself through the eyes of others, and trying to pre-emptively understand what judgments and opinions they may be making about you at any given moment. Penny seemed to understand this. ‘‘These are the things that we as black people think and feel and can’t say,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s the fine line we all walk.’’

Lena Waithe, a producer of the recent movie ‘‘Dear White People,’’ thinks a coming cluster of TV shows, including Rae’s, will broaden the types of stories being told about black America. ‘‘She was at the beginning of the wave of creators, black millennials who don’t fit into either stream,’’ she says. ‘‘They don’t come from the ’hood, but they aren’t the Huxtables.’’ She pointed to Jerrod Carmichael and Donald Glover, two black comics whose pilots were recently picked up. ‘‘There are black people on television, but they’re still painted with broad strokes,’’ she says. ‘‘We don't have characters painted with tiny paintbrushes.’’

Rae’s desire to render her world accurately has pushed her to be particular about her hiring decisions. To direct her pilot, Rae signed on Melina Matsoukas, best known for her lush art direction on music videos, including Rihanna’s ‘‘We Found Love.’’ At a casting session in July, Matsoukas and Rae were auditioning a woman for the Molly character. Molly is modeled on Rae’s real-life best friend, a corporate lawyer who grew up in South Central and can flawlessly toggle her speech patterns and behaviors to suit her environment. Rae didn’t quite know how to ask the actress to act more ‘‘street,’’ but she needed to see if she could code-switch with the same dexterity as her friend. Matsoukas tried to guide the actress through it, and she fumbled despite the coaching, helping Rae realize she might not be the right person for the role.

As Rae sees it, the lack of diversity in writers’ rooms makes it hard to develop complex characters of color on-screen. Her solution is to bring more people of color into the television-writing pipeline, so she spends much of her free time working on Color Creative, a digital platform she co-founded for minority writers. She helps produce and find funding for their web shows, and offers aspiring writers a place to showcase their work. She started the organization, in part, as a response to her own difficulties with the network pitching process. ‘‘I don’t ever want it to be just me, ever,’’ she says. ‘‘That is the worst feeling, to be alone, because then all the pressure is on you. People expect you to be the voice of everyone.’’

As Penny and Rae finished their meal, Penny told her stories from his decade-long career, in which he was, more often than not, the only black person in the writers’ room. In 2000, he made a film about the way men and women interpret milestones in relationships. Its working title was ‘‘You Say Tomato,’’ but his production company wanted to package it better for a black audience. Rae erupted with laughter as he dropped the punch line: The movie was eventually released as ‘‘Soul Talkin’.’’

Throughout the arc of his career, Penny explained, he has often found himself in situations that required a delicate touch, and he stressed the importance of staying professional in uncomfortable settings. His anecdotes and advice added up to something like a guide to navigating Hollywood while black. Rae listened, rapt, drinking in his words. He later summarized his philosophy to me this way: ‘‘Make sure you’re professional, and your stuff is tight. Have it together. You can’t ever look like you are not on your game. As a writer of color, be strategic, and be careful.’’

The check came, and Rae picked it up. Before they left, they lingered, seemingly reluctant to say goodbye. Eventually, Penny grew serious, offering words of motivation. ‘‘I want you to win,’’ he said. ‘‘If you win, another Issa wins. And another, and another.’’",REAL
Out of the Woods,"All parties had been minding their business until 2003, when Neal Appelbaum — a 5-foot-6, bearded, bald, Jewish 47-year-old former C.P.A. — bought the old Paul Melton farm on Parchcorn Hollow Road in Woodbury, the only place here that can be called a town without using air quotes. He became one of the county’s busiest developers, landowners and real estate agents. He was elected president of the county’s Chamber of Commerce and chairman of its industrial board and was hired to run the arts center, where, in the Southern way, people call him by the formal-­familiar ‘‘Mr. Neal.’’ Soon there were few aspects of the county’s day-to-day functioning in which he wasn’t involved. Appelbaum says that when Gannon’s term expires in 2018, he will run for the job. Gannon told me he thinks Appelbaum has a better-than-even chance of winning. That would make Appelbaum the first non-­Christian, non-­straight, non-­married-­to-­a-­woman county executive, the first without familial roots in the area and the first openly gay person to run a county in the South.

This dance of the Short Mountain faeries and Cannon County could not have happened until recently, because being gay in this country is changing more fundamentally and faster than at any time in its history. You have to look only to the recent Supreme Court decision that affirms same-sex marriage as a constitutional right to see the beginning of the last act for legally enshrined homophobia. In the decision’s wake, some have struck an elegiac note, lamenting the loss of a shared identity in the coming post-gay landscape; ‘‘The thing I miss is the specialness of being gay,’’ the playwright Lisa Kron remarked in an interview with The New York Times. I wondered whether the gay residents of rural Tennessee shared this lament. I wanted to see how the encounter between gays and straights was unfolding far from the coastal cities, among two of the most culturally divergent constituencies I could think of — rural anti-­assimilationist queers and their evangelical conservative neighbors, both of whom happen to oppose same-sex marriage, though for vastly different reasons. I wondered too about the Commune’s future: What does a sanctuary signify once people are free to leave it?

It doesn’t take long to notice that Cannon County is an odd setting for a faerie sanctuary. On the mountain’s steep north face there is a stable that allows visitors to sip on tallboys of beer atop a moving horse, and at the summit there is a Church of Christ bible camp. More than 70 churches cater to fewer than 14,000 people here, a ratio that’s high even for the Bible Belt. Twenty percent of the housing stock is trailers. The last time national TV networks set up camp here was in 1994, when a group called Sons of Confederate Veterans nearly persuaded the county to incorporate the confederate battle flag into its official banner.

The faeries weren’t the first strangers to come to Short Mountain. Locals still remember when it was home to moonshiners’ cabins, and over the years the greenery here has shielded many wayward people from unwelcome eyes. With its limestone striations and sandstone cap, the mountain is a remnant of the Cumberland Plateau and resembles nothing around it. What is around it looks downright strange. The ground erupts in perfectly hemispheric hills that the locals call knobs. They give the place the topography of cheese bubbling on a pizza, one reason neither industry nor large-scale farming ever prospered here. The knobs are fun to look at up close, especially in the summer, when the steep hillsides blaze up like billboards of neon green interrupted only by handfuls of biscuit-­colored Hereford cattle. Sometimes, when a dog barks or a car backfires in Cannon County, the sound, bouncing off the hillsides, can travel for miles.

In 1973, well before Sex Change Ridge got its name, about a dozen mostly straight political radicals from North Carolina pooled money and bought the land on Short Mountain from a retired couple. They were committed to ending the war in Vietnam and to improving race relations; the group put out an underground newspaper and had spent time in Cuba. In Tennessee, they found pockets of sympathetic neighbors, back-to-the-land types who had come to the area after seeing an ad in a magazine called Mother Earth News. ‘‘We were aware of gay liberation and supported it,’’ Milo Pyne, a member of the original group from North Carolina, told me. ‘‘The sexual atmosphere was inclusive.’’

By the late ’70s, many in the group had left. ‘‘Some people discovered that they couldn’t stand each other, and others were starting families and wanted a more conventional home life,’’ Pyne said. ‘‘I wanted the community to survive, so I began looking around for new residents.’’ While visiting New Orleans, Pyne (who then used the surname Guthrie and who identifies as bisex­ual) met several faeries and hatched an idea. He placed an ad in RFD — a publication popular with the faeries that billed itself as ‘‘the magazine for country faggots’’ — inviting readers to come to Short Mountain. ‘‘All around the country, there was a palpable sense of danger,’’ Pyne said. In 1978, Dan White shot a fellow city supervisor, Harvey Milk, in San Francisco City Hall; when White was convicted of manslaughter instead of murder, the city’s gay community looted stores and blew up police cruisers.

The early years were difficult, but a steady stream of gay and lesbian settlers, mostly from cities, found a long-term home on the mountain; Pyne was the sole member of the original group to stay on. Within a few years, the AIDS epidemic added another level of meaning to the notion of sanctuary, and for a time residents tried using it as a hospice. ‘‘There simply wasn’t enough medical care available in the woods,’’ Pyne recalled. Women formed a part of the community from the beginning but remained a distinct minority, a continuing source of controversy. Pyne left to become a botanist in 1985, by which time the Commune had become both a magnet and a gathering place for other gay men and women. ‘‘For a lot of older country people in the area, the transition from hippies to gays was almost imperceptible,’’ Pyne said. ‘‘All they knew is that there was a bunch of longhaired young people doing weird stuff up on the mountain.’’

For many men, the Commune became their first encounter with country living and a laboratory for questioning assumptions about the shape and possibilities of their lives. Sandor Katz, who lived at the Commune for 17 years, told me that when he realized he was gay, as a teenager in the ’70s, he became resigned to having to live in cities. ‘‘Years later, while walking through the East Village, I found a coffee table with a detached leg that someone had thrown away,’’ he said. ‘‘I recall calling a friend and asking him how to fix it. I was 28 and had no idea how to put a leg on a table.’’ Shortly after, he learned he had H.I.V. ‘‘Something had to change in my life, but I didn’t know what,’’ he said. Some Commune members he met suggested he visit Short Mountain; Katz settled there in 1993.

Off-the-grid living creates certain imperatives, and in his time there he learned to hunt, build houses, dig wells and preserve food. These days Katz, who is 53, writes about fermentation and food traditions and offers workshops a few miles from the Commune, at an 1820s farmhouse that he restored and expanded. ‘‘Urban gay men have become a de­skilled class,’’ he said. ‘‘Having to learn these traditionally masculine skills was hugely empowering.’’ Sometime after he arrived at the faerie sanctuary, Katz and his friends began calling it the Short Mountain Refinishing School for the Butch Arts.

Amid the doldrums of late January, with New York blanketed in gray snow, I set off for Short Mountain, a journey that would leave my rented Nissan sedan with a partly detached front bumper. Having watched the sun set in the windows of roadside restaurants along Interstate 81, I reached Woodbury under a nearly full moon, and Appelbaum and his husband, Garth Hawkins, guided me the rest of the way to the Commune, a place I surely wouldn’t have found alone. Its entrance came into view at the bottom of a dicey-­looking mountain road. We shared a late vegetarian dinner with roughly a dozen residents at an antebellum farmhouse that serves as the main meeting place and kitchen. I introduced myself to a young woman with a nose ring who was brewing a witchy-­looking tea out of marigolds, calendula hay and something else I can’t recall. ‘‘Hi,’’ she said, shaking my hand. ‘‘I’m Altercation.’’ Someone showed me the way to the nearest outhouse — it turned out to be an open-air four-­seater — and on my walk there, one of God’s creatures lurched across my path, passing so close in the unrelieved dark that the hair on the back of my neck stood up, reminding me of all the reasons I’ve never lived in the country.

I first met Appelbaum in the late ’80s, at the Midwestern college we attended, and it was already clear that he was interested in fixing things, an unusual quality in a society of 20-year-old stoners. Even then he tended to run things, because the people who did it before him weren’t as good at it, and because he wasn’t averse to the responsibility but actually courted it. After graduating, he spent a decade in Chicago, where he became active in Act Up, started a recycling company, bought his first property and met Hawkins, who is now a FEMA reservist. In the end, they found city living inefficient. They chose Cannon County because it combined two qualities that rarely coexist in a single place: a sizable gay community and a cost of living low enough to make full-time work an option rather than a necessity. It wasn’t perfect. The closest places to buy a book or an artichoke were 25 miles away in Murfreesboro, but for Appelbaum and Hawkins, the advantages outweighed the problems.

Soon after they arrived in Woodbury, Appelbaum learned that a logging company was selling a tract of land adjacent to the Commune. Its residents worried about potential developers and the threat to the habitat from aggressive logging, but no one had found a solution. With money borrowed from his father, a Ford executive who later made a small fortune selling cars, Appelbaum bought the 535-acre lot; placed it under a conservation easement that prevented clear cutting, overhead wires and overzealous building; subdivided it into plots; and sold them at cost to longtime visitors to the Commune who wanted to settle nearby but could not find or afford land. It was in this way that he appointed himself the benefactor of the gay hippies of Middle Tennessee.

When Appelbaum contemplates the day ahead of him, he scrunches his forehead, crosses his arms and juts his lower jaw out just far enough to reveal a tuft of chest hair sticking up out of his collar, a look that goes a ways toward explaining his high-school nickname, Nealanderthal. He tends to dress like a summer-­camp counselor. He speaks in an uninflected monotone, so when he told me that his neighbor Ronnie Timmons’s bull got loose and was running up and down the road, I didn’t know whether he was joking. But he is in constant flux; motion is too mild a word for it. ‘‘I’m no good at TV shows,’’ Appelbaum told me, ‘‘because I can’t sit still for 21 minutes.’’",REAL
The Tough Love of ‘Austerity’,"Photo

Austerity, diet of our lives, girder of our loins. At the moment, the word brings to mind the continuing crisis in Greece and, by extension, the power of the Germans holding the purse strings. ‘‘Austerity’’ has become the catchall word for the cost-cutting a government enacts in order to balance its books: Cut pensions, cut the public payroll, cut social services — cut whatever and wherever. Shrink spending, shrink debt, shrink deficits. The idea is to inspire confidence and make the place more attractive to investors, who prefer a government that’s tough and lean to one that’s marbled and tender.

That, at least, is the theory. Germany has been a big proponent of austerity measures, but German officials avoid invoking Austerität, preferring instead Sparpolitik, or ‘‘savings policy.’’ Chancellor Angela Merkel has made her distaste for the A-word well known. ‘‘I call it balancing the budget,’’ she said at an event a couple of years ago. ‘‘Everyone else is using this term ‘austerity.’ That makes it sound like something truly evil.’’ Austerity implies deprivation, undertaken under duress, to be suffered through or endured; a ‘‘savings policy,’’ by contrast, sounds practical and prudent, a solid foundation for a sensible way of life.

As it happens, the word ‘‘austerity’’ owes its roots to the ancient Greeks, for whom austeros meant ‘‘harsh,’’ ‘‘rough,’’ ‘‘bitter.’’ It denotes dryness and astringency, a constriction that cuts off the bleeding and dissolves the fat. The desirability of this therefore depends on whether the bleeding and fat are endangering the organism or are, as blood flow and body fat have been known to do, sustaining it. During times of scarcity or subsistence — which is to say, most of human history — life was austere, not so much by choice but simply by dint of the way things were. When affluence, or surplus, became a possibility, austerity could go from unavoidable circumstance to attainable goal. In the recent book ‘‘Austerity: The Great Failure,’’ the historian Florian Schui presents Aristotle, born in 384 B.C., as laying the philosophical groundwork for austere living as an ideal, even if he didn’t use the term. The son of a king’s physician, Aristotle led a life of considerable privilege, studying at Plato’s academy and traveling around Greece. He was comfortable, but he was also leery of excess. Aristotle wanted to discuss the ‘‘abstinence’’ that would allow for ‘‘the good life.’’ The pursuit of wealth for its own sake was endless, whereas ‘‘the art of managing a household’’ had natural limits, its own equilibrium.

This shrewd (and, it must be said, mythical) household would become a favorite muse for austerity’s proponents, even when they began talking about the economies of entire countries: the thrifty state as a bigger version of the thrifty household, taking care never to spend more than it takes in, scrimping and saving and carrying little to no debt. Unlike the household, though, which has been venerated ad nauseam, the state has historically been an object of suspicion, especially in classical economics. Mark Blyth, a political economist at Brown University and the author of ‘‘Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea,’’ traces the concept of fiscal austerity back to the 17th-century British philosopher John Locke and an ambivalence toward state power. Locke and his fellow liberals recognized the need for government to overthrow the divine right of kings, but they also feared government, worrying it could give with one hand and take away with the other. Instead, Blyth writes, the market was to be the ‘‘antidote to the confiscatory politics of the king,’’ and the bond market of creditors would keep the state in check. The smaller the government, the better; it should protect property rights and otherwise get out of the way.

In other words, the market was to be left alone — ‘‘laissez faire’’ — so that it was free to operate according to its natural laws. Recessions and downturns were the market’s way of correcting itself. When government intervenes, it invariably distorts. During World War I, deficits in the United States ballooned, and a succession of American presidents in the 1920s were committed to slashing government spending. Warren G. Harding created a Federal Liquidation Board, whose purpose was the shuttering of government offices. ‘‘We are going to cut the garment to fit the cloth,’’ he explained. His successor, Calvin Coolidge, once received a gift of two lion cubs and named them Tax Reduction and Budget Bureau. But it was the Treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who would perhaps become best known for an almost fanatical adherence to austerity. After the crash of 1929, President Herbert Hoover recalled in his memoirs, Mellon insisted that he knew what the country needed: ‘‘Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate.’’ The market had overindulged in speculation and borrowing, and it was issuing its own emetic. ‘‘It will purge the rottenness out of the system,’’ Hoover remembered Mellon saying. ‘‘People will work harder, live a more moral life.’’ Austerity was the natural consequence of the market returning to its purer, laissez-faire state. The ensuing Depression therefore gave laissez-faire a terrible name. In 1931, Business Week asked, ‘‘Do You Still Believe in Lazy-Fairies?’’",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock’,"Photo

My first hours with the spiky words of T.S. Eliot’s ‘‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock’’ are fixed in a precise location: the cluttered space of my teenage bedroom floor. It’s 1982. The light is low. The parquet tiles are coming unglued. Album covers — Talking Heads, David Bowie, the Clash — fan out around me, and an array of paperbacks sprawl among a week’s discarded clothes. I begin to read: ‘‘Let us go then, you and I,/When the evening is spread out against the sky/Like a patient etherized upon a table’’ — and, with a 17-year-old’s sense of imminent upheaval, feel the stirrings of a new language in me, connected to my own language but having passed through fire. I can’t say whether the voice the poem puts in my head as it extends its opening invitation is stiffly formal, smarmy or seductive. ‘‘Spread yourself out on the floor,’’ it seems to whisper, ‘‘and prepare to be turned inside-out.’’

As I read on, the poem describes a journey in which benignly empty social rituals — sipping tea, making chitchat, standing by as your elders comment on your clothes and hairstyle — are experienced as an excruciation. Prufrock, the speaker, is ‘‘Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse,’’ and tortuously ambivalent. He endures his trials by veering into fantasy, imagining himself as a parade of persecuted figures — from an insect and a lowly crab to headless John the Baptist, Lazarus and Hamlet — and recasting his decrepit hosts as ‘‘sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown.’’ His dutiful, socialized self runs aground on the shoals of the horny, defiant, bitterly funny antihero within. ‘‘Do I dare/Disturb the universe?’’ he asks, with parodic grandiosity. Yes, I do!

An unsigned reviewer wrote: ‘‘The fact these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to ‘poetry.’ ”

From The Times Literary Supplement after ‘‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock’’ was published in a pamphlet of poems by T.S. Eliot in 1917.

The spirit of the poem is punky and irreverent, spot-on in its mockery of the starched language of authority and smeared with the grime of its churned-up dream life. I don’t know a thing about Eliot, but I know a teenage wasteland. This poem feels like home: Not the one I live in, but the one that lives in me.

‘‘Prufrock’’ would become the poem that lent my adolescent self protection from the wounds of chronic alienation and gave me tart words to wield against the insipidness of the world. Eliot himself was barely out of his teens when he wrote it, uncannily in touch with the exquisite torments of hypersensitive youth, and with the peculiar burden of seeing through everything without having experienced much of anything. This was a different species of verse. It exuded cinematic urgency rather than exam-ready ‘‘messages’’ and ‘‘themes.’’ It was full of sudden rhythmic jolts and colliding tones, and could make emotional pirouettes on a vowel. Unapologetic, brash, discontinuous, ‘‘Prufrock’’ taught me the thrill of disorientation in language. No matter how often I returned, it was never tamped down by classroom-style explanations. It grew. It seemed to understand me more than I understood it.

And then, as Prufrock himself might have predicted, I moved on, grew up, rolled the bottoms of my trousers and basically shelved the poem. At college, I heard ‘‘Prufrock’’ discussed, drearily, as a poem about impotence and generational anomie, and felt the flames of my poetic ardor spritzed with academic retardant. To top it off, I learned of Eliot’s nastiness regarding Jews, blacks, women and humanity in general. This Eliot was the face of the oppressive canon — a moralizing scold, the very antithesis of the poet whose voice had set off waves of overwhelmed sensation in me not long before.

Last spring, as ‘‘Prufrock’’ approached the hundredth anniversary of its first publication — and I found myself half that age, enduring a bout of back pain — I lay on the floor with its pages spread before me once again. Like its reader, the poem had aged but was still quite vital. I lifted myself to my feet and, feeling unprepared and more than a little hesitant, took ‘‘Prufrock’’ to my students at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. I was surprised to learn that most of them had only a passing acquaintance with the poem. Their detachment presented a great opportu­nity. With our heads buried in the page, we teased out all kinds of things that wouldn’t have mattered to me in the past — the syncopated metrical effects, the associative skittishness and branching-out ambiguities, the mysterious cobbling together of an unmistakable, singular voice out of numerous smatterings of others’ words. Eliot’s ugly politics couldn’t diminish the radical, explosive force of his poetry. To a roomful of aspiring poets, ‘‘Prufrock’’ wasn’t about impotence at all, but rather vulnerability and the struggle to find the right words — problems with which my students were deeply familiar, and that provided the source of the poem’s heat-seeking energy.

I lost myself in its winding passageways and felt momentarily reunited with my teenage self, transported into a world of frightening, delirious possibility. ‘‘Prufrock’’ could restore me to the primal necessities of poetry like nothing else. It wasn’t the same poem I discovered years earlier, nor the poem my students read, but with disarming specificity, ‘‘Prufrock’’ remained capable of speaking to an enduring desire for something larger than myself, made available through the shape-shifting powers of the imagination. ‘‘Why is the poem called a love song?’’ a student asked. It was a good question. I turned to the class. ‘‘Is Prufrock in love?’’ Long silence. Then a student spoke: ‘‘Yes,’’ she said. ‘‘In love with poetry.’’",REAL
Ice Cube Might Have Dinner With the President,"You hear a lot these days about ‘‘the talk’’ black parents have with their children, warning them that they need to be careful how they interact with law enforcement. Have you had that talk with your children, or do you just have them listen to your old records? Of course, and not only about law enforcement. I’ve had that talk about their teachers, the coach, the doctor, the lawyer and anybody else they come across. I don’t just limit it to law enforcement, because black kids gotta know how to deal with everybody.

Is there a tension between the real-world concerns you have as a parent and the anti-police attitude you express in some of your songs? I think that if you haven’t broken the law, there’s nothing wrong with complying with authority. The thing is: Don’t get shot. Don’t give ’em a reason to put their hands on you. Nothing wrong with complying; just make sure you come home.

Do you think that having smartphones in 1980s Compton would have made a difference? No. There’s photography from the 1800s of lynchings. People went to picnics, and they’d take pictures with somebody burnt to death up there. It doesn’t matter.

You’re right. I was going to use that as a segue to talk about black cops. Three black cops were arrested in connection with the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore. Some people have pointed to this as evidence that police brutality isn’t always about race. It’s not. It’s about power, giving it to people who don’t deserve it: bad cops, corrupt cops, abusive cops. And the problem is not the bad cops, the problem is the good cops, because they won’t tell on the bad cops. They got a no-snitching policy, and then they expect us not to have one in the hood.

Is It Wrong If a Friend Sells My Hand-Me-Downs?,"Photo

I have two small children and am frequently divesting our household of toys, clothes and other child supplies. I sell the larger items, but I typically give the smaller items away to a neighborhood parent or leave them in a box in front of my house to be taken for free. A friend on my block recently indicated that she takes much of what we leave out, and I’ve since offered her first pick before leaving the remaining items outside. I was happy to do so, as she has two children a bit younger than mine, and I considered it a worthwhile gesture to share what we no longer need with her, despite the fact that she is of similar economic status and likely doesn’t need our castoffs. She recently held a stoop sale, and I recognized a very large number of the items that were formerly ours on display for sale. Am I wrong to see this as somehow inappropriate? I recognize that a gift means I’m not free to question what the receiver does with it, but this has changed the way I feel about her and the prospect of putting out other items in the future. Am I wrong to feel that she should have passed on these items to others? NAME WITHHELD, BROOKLYN

Kenji Yoshino: The neighbor’s behavior is unethical, because she is violating a norm of generosity: She should do for someone else what was done for her. Usually I would recommend talking to her, but I suspect the response would be, ‘‘You didn’t have a legitimate interest in the toys after you gave them to me.’’ Your obvious rejoinder is, ‘‘But I had an interest in you.’’ This will very likely cause a break.

Amy Bloom: The break has already occurred, unless you’re going to get a mortified apology. I sympathize with the letter writer because it feels as if one is bringing some level of commerce into what she had seen as a friendly neighbor exchange. But the fact is, it’s not wrong for the person to sell them later.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: I find it a bit hard to locate exactly what the problem is. One of the ways in which you pass things on is by selling them. It’s a very good idea in our rather waste-driven society for people to recycle things. Giving them away, putting them on the stoop, selling them — these are all ways of recycling. The reason there’s something slightly tacky here is that the presumption of the gift is that I’m giving it to you for your use. If you immediately sell it, then that is a violation of the understanding under which you got it.

Bloom: Right, it’s a disruption in the friendship loop. The letter writer’s feelings are hurt, and there’s a hard-to-untie knot in what had felt like a smooth and friendly relationship.

Appiah: There’s a spectrum here. At one end is somebody who takes these things and immediately runs a sale the next day. Maybe on eBay, so you don’t know about it, but still. At the other end, she uses them for a couple of years, the kids outgrow them, she has a sale on the stoop. I don’t get a clear picture where we are along that spectrum. But at some point, it’s wrong to hold it against someone for choosing this way of recycling.",REAL
He’s Got Legs,"Photo

Up above the hems of a proper pair of trousers — above the ankle-­baring ends of high-­waters and clam-­diggers, above the shin-­skimming edges of pants named for the isle of Capri and for the gauchos of the Pampas — are the knees. Bared by shorts, they point us toward a few truths about social standards. Women’s legs are tangled in their own sex-­segregated history of social control and gender politics; shorts are, first off, short pants, and it was not so very long ago that women were told wearing pants of any length was prima facie evidence of moral turpitude. The man in shorts, meanwhile, occupies a space that is more subtly strange. Year after year, as surely as tender spring yields to scalding summer, a season of dress-­code controversies gives way to a running conversation about the unwritten rules of urban spaces, with arbiters of taste cringing at men’s legs in shorts as if wincing at a comedy of embarrassment.

A century ago, little boys throughout the English-­speaking world wore shorts on their legs and, with few exceptions, nothing else. Maybe, if the boys were not quite so little or if the weather was not quite so warm, they wore the knee breeches called knickerbockers. (Maybe not — some British boys still wore flannel shorts throughout the school year, collecting memories of inner thighs chapped by rubbing against cuffs soaked with melted snow.) The line drawn between youth and maturity was a hemline, and to be a 14-year-old stepping into trousers for the first time was to be the initiate at a puberty rite. The Sears catalog of 1916 sold long pants as the ­marker separating ‘‘the playground’’ from ‘‘bright visions of a business career.’’ A 1937 trouser ad asked rhetorically, ‘‘Who’d go back to short pants after ‘graduating’ to longies?’’ Those childish things were put away for good, unless you were taking a walk in the woods or serving the crown in the Raj or tending to your charges at a Boy Scout camp.

Foes of shorts — you may know the type of man who, despite the risk of developing heat rash and a reputation as a crank, opposes the things on principle — argue that the childishness denoted by their brevity cannot be overcome. The detractors contend that shorts are categorically unattractive on grown men, that even when they look good they seem callow. I need to guess that on some level, a significant subset of shorts-­wearers agree, given the persistence of cargo shorts. The pockets of cargo shorts, though ideally practical for a roofer or a gaffer on the job, make rather less sense as the omnipresent ornaments of weekend-­wear that they are, unless you regard them as a kind of ballast to balance puerility. Those pockets aren’t empty; they’re full of the idea of rugged work. To butch up the look in full, a fellow does not settle for the basic khaki coloring of old colonial campaigns but instead pursues a camouflage print. This is a standard streetwise look — camo cargos, T-shirt, a pair of Nikes bearing the soaring silhouette of Michael Jordan. Not for nothing, ­Jordan’s early ’90s taste in long basketball shorts is credited with steering us away from skimpiness and toward hems that swagger below the kneecaps, swishing like zoot suits.

The most rigorous rebuttals of the anti-shorts view emanate from the archives of the Men’s Dress Reform Party, a flock of odd ducks active in Britain between 1929 and 1937. Following the example of feminists like Amelia ­Bloomer, whose name graced the trousers that freed suffragists from corsetry and heavy skirts, the group sought to rescue men’s clothing from the ‘‘rut of ugliness and unhealthiness’’ into which they felt it had sunk. The party preferred open-­necked shirts to stiff collars, sandals to shoes and anything to a frock coat. Skeptical of long trousers, it promoted shorts (and kilts) as instruments of physical and moral hygiene. The adamant plea that men ventilate the God-­given lines of their calves exemplified the cause. The members were mocked as subversives and crackpots — a charge that, given the presence of eugenicists among its ranks, has its merits. But I wonder if we can now agree that the trade journal Tailor and Cutter laid it on too thick in urging repression, insisting that the laces and buttons that the party encouraged men to cast off were restraints against sav­agery: ‘‘A loosening of the bonds will gradually impel mankind to sag and droop bodily and spiritually.’’

The United States never saw the likes of the Men’s Dress Reform Party on these shores. What we got, instead, was a frolicsome species of campus unrest. On May 9, 1930, the student newspaper at Dartmouth College published an editorial asserting the good sense of wearing shorts and calling upon readers to bare their nether limbs as if waving banners of revolt. The next day, some 600 Dartmouth men took to the streets in shorts — in basketball uniforms and hiking gear and cutoffs and at least one pair of lederhosen — and they made national news. Were the boys staging a protest or pulling a prank? No one was entirely certain. It is often the fate of radical movements to defy immediate comprehension, and quite a few decades passed between the crusade of 1930 and the advent of sophomores slouching into lecture halls half-­wrapped in polyester mesh promoting the lacrosse team. In the meantime, campuses continued to serve as incubators of pro-shorts agitation, emerging as some of the first venues to welcome — or at least tolerate — Bermuda shorts.",REAL
A Mess of Clams,"Photo

‘‘The hard-shell is the king of the clams,’’ a clam merchant named Archie M. Clock told the New Yorker writer Joseph Mitchell in 1939. They were sitting on Clock’s battered old sloop, the Jennie Tucker, out on the wind-ruffled waters of the Great South Bay, off Islip and Babylon, on Long Island. Mitchell was there to report on the harvest of the hard-shell littleneck and cherrystone clams that then dominated the shellfish sections of New York restaurant menus.

Mitchell called Long Island clams ‘‘the saltiest, cleanest and biggest-bellied clams in the world.’’ Their species, Mercenaria mercenaria, can be found along the Atlantic coast from the Canadian Maritimes to the top of the Caribbean.

Aboard the Jennie Tucker, Clock gave Mitchell a list of things you could do with a hard-shell clam. ‘‘He can be baked,’’ Clock said. He can be ‘‘fried, steamed, put into chowder or served on the half-shell.’’

That is true as north. Many recent kitchen experiments over the course of this summer confirm it, 76 years later. You can bake and fry clams all you like and get a marvelous result. But steaming is one of the best, and easiest, ways to prepare them — particularly if you haven’t dealt with a lot of clams, and absolutely if you want to eat a lot of them.

Start with a mess of clams. It might be a bag of farmed Manilas from your local market, or a small basket raked from the mud yourself. On the eastern end of Long Island, where I’ve been cooking a lot lately, a mess of clams translates as a cool 100 littlenecks, all of them taken from either Peconic Bay or the Long Island Sound.

Starring Vermouth,"Photo

A few years ago, my brother asked me where I would like to spend my 40th birthday. I chose Spain, and he generously presented me with a plane ticket to Barcelona. I booked a sunny apartment with an abundance of colorful tiles. I got a ticket for an FC Barcelona match at Camp Nou. But in the weeks leading up to my birthday, my mother’s health declined precipitously. I couldn’t leave New York under the circumstances, and canceled the trip.

So when my friend Katie surprised me in January with the birthday gift of a beautiful bottle of a Spanish vermouth that I hadn’t tried before, the present was more touching than she could have known. The vermouth she gave me, Primitivo Quiles rojo, is produced by an old family-operated winery in Spain’s Alicante province. It’s a little raisiny, fragrant with spice and bark, suggestive of green walnuts. It’s immensely enjoyable to drink.

I’ve always been pro-vermouth. I favor a substantially wet martini. But I would like to see it more often as the star of a drink, not just a supporting player. Essentially wine flavored with spices and herbs and other aromatics, it is the easiest and arguably greatest of aperitifs. It is versatile, relatively low in alcohol and a bargain (many of my favorite bottles hover in the $20 range). I cook with it too: Whenever I pan-fry a steak, I finish it just as my mother did, with a quick vermouth flambé. There are French vermouths, Italian vermouths and American vermouths that I like. But because of that birthday gift, this has been my year of Spanish vermouth. I’ve brought a bottle with me to every party I’ve gone to in the past six months or so, and my hosts and fellow guests have been as surprised and delighted by it as I am. I created a simple cocktail by combining the Primitivo Quiles vermouth rojo with fresh grapefruit juice, tonic and Angostura bitters: an instant favorite.

Not long ago I sat down to talk (and taste) vermouth with Alexandra Raij. With her husband, Eder Montero, Raij is the owner and chef of three Spanish restaurants in New York City — El Quinto Pino, La Vara and Txikito — that feature cocktails made with Spanish vermouth. At El Quinto Pino, there’s a particularly elegant drink that Raij named the Montserrat, in honor of the Virgin of Montserrat, Catalonia’s patron saint. It calls for Casa Mariol’s Vermut Negre, which is tinged with cinnamon and is reminiscent (I mean this as a compliment) of very good root beer. There’s also a terrific dish on the restaurant’s menu of surf clams with olives and vermouth gelée. But Raij extolled the more pared-down pleasures of the Marianito as well (chilled, dry vermouth over ice, with olives and citrus to garnish) and Vermut Preparado (same deal, but with sweet vermouth).

I still haven’t made that trip to Spain. But drinking Spanish vermouth deepens my imaginings. I’ll get there.

Off the Road,"I called my wife to say that my truck was finally dead. I felt a lump in my throat. Then I cried. Like, really cried. I thought: That’s weird, I’m crying over a car. What’s that about? I came up with psychological explanations: I’ve been really tense lately, feeling money worries.

The next day, I cried again. I thought, Maybe it’s all the memories of climbing with my dad and my buddies in my 20s. My wife told me we could afford to buy a new car. I found that hard to believe, but she smiled and said it was true. She offered to go right out and buy a new Toyota pickup. But I knew that a pickup was a dumb car for a city family with two kids. No, I said. We’ll get something more practical.

The mechanic knew a salvage yard that would give me a few hundred bucks for my truck. I called and made a date to meet their tow-truck guy. I got there first and saw my old pickup for the last time, and I bawled my eyes out. This time I had to face the truth: I loved that damn truck, and I wished I had a farm so I could park it out back and sleep in the camper shell a few times a year until I died. I saw that I was deeply attached to a vision of my past self, but also to a vision of the future, half-conscious until now. I wanted to be that guy still driving to the beach at age 65 in my 40-year-old truck with a sun-yellowed surfboard in the back, still surfing serious waves because I never gave in to all that materialistic stuff that makes guys give up on the physical life in pursuit of the money to buy fancy cars.

The tender vanity of that fantasy, and of my whole dumb attachment to this truck, somehow made me think of the final scene of the original Rambo movie. After Stallone has practically destroyed a small town in Washington State, his old commander talks him down. Rambo starts crying, weeping really, remembering a Special Forces buddy named Joey and how they talked about Las Vegas and cruising in Joey’s ’58 Chevy convertible, and through his sobbing we see that inside even the toughest American man is a little boy who never grew up. I’m guessing that scene popped to mind because I was a car guy after all, and because I dearly wanted to go home again and drive all the way into the mountains with my dad.

I said to the truck driver, ‘‘Hey brother, I need a favor.’’ I really called him that — brother. I don’t know why. ‘‘Will you take a picture of me with it before you tow it away?’’

I got the feeling that he’d done this before, and that he didn’t mind.

‘‘Lot of years,’’ I said. ‘‘Hard to say goodbye.’’ I bumped the top of my fist against my heart.

How to Project Power,"Photo

‘‘Keep your limbs away from your body,’’ says Deborah H Gruenfeld, a social psychologist who teaches at Stanford University. Some research shows that people posed in expansive postures feel more powerful, exhibit higher testosterone levels and have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol — all characteristics of high-ranking social status. Make eye contact while you’re talking, but feel free to look away when others do. This is what scientists call having a high ‘‘look-speak to look-listen ratio,’’ which is common for dominant members of groups.

Gruenfeld spent decades studying the psychology of power, but she found that her students were flummoxed. They understood the research but couldn’t figure out how to be more authoritative in their own lives. ‘‘It occurred to me that this is what actors do all the time: They show up in character and convincingly act like people they are not,’’ she says. So in 2008, she and a theater instructor began offering a class at the Stanford business school called Acting With Power. To her surprise, the class did not appeal to just women and international students. Olympic athletes also showed up, as well as ‘‘overprivileged, overeducated white guys and pretty much everyone else,’’ she says.

Don’t bother overexplaining yourself. Speak succinctly. Take ownership of the space around you, whether it’s a boardroom or a cubicle. ‘‘Say to yourself: ‘This is my room. This is my table. This is my audience,’ ’’ Gruenfeld says. Most people, women especially, tend to underestimate their standing and worry about being pushy and bossy long before others perceive that to be the case.

You can achieve influence over others by being intimidating and aggressive, but Gruenfeld encourages her students to consider the duties that come with power. ‘‘Think of yourself as a protector,’’ she tells them. This is especially true for women working in male-dominated environments like Silicon Valley. ‘‘I have in mind the queen,’’ Gruenfeld says. ‘‘She has dignity and respect, and she makes people feel safe, but underneath her cape is a sword.’’",REAL

The 7.26.15 Issue,"Cruz clearly believes that the country would benefit from having a Kirk-like figure in the White House. But as arguments for electing a Republican go, this is not a winning one.

Kirk’s character is charismatic and assertive. But Kirk — quick to action and even quicker to take risks — is also prone to letting his passions get in the way of what is best for his crew and the mission at hand.

In fact, Kirk’s saving grace is that his more rational crew members — his interstellar cabinet, so to speak — keep him in check. No one more so than Spock, often described as Kirk’s more logical alter ego.

Given that President Obama is often compared to Spock, it’s no surprise to see Cruz claim Kirk for the Republicans. But far from being a more ‘‘complete’’ leader than Picard, as Cruz likes to claim, Kirk is a rather one-dimensional figure whose most memorable successes take place during crises — and even then, generally in spite of himself.

The article could have done without this bad attempt at humor: ‘‘If you start to salivate when you hear the phrase ‘black men with jobs,’ then Diggs is your guy.’’ To a black man like me, it came off as flippant, unworthy of being published in The Times and, well, offensive. I am also gay, and a member of a multiracial gay male group founded on the premise that interracial relationships need to be celebrated.

Hannaham’s comment reminded me of conversations we’ve had in our group about what fuels desire, and what happens when desire intersects with fetishes, particularly ones based on stereotypes. We discovered that this creates a dissonance for the ‘‘desirable’’ man, who comes to believe that a relationship based ostensibly on love in many cases includes desire based on a stereotype, even if the stereotype seems positive. The man becomes less an individual and more of a ‘‘thing’’ to be desired based on his employment and race, rather than his personhood. Tony Glover, posted on nytimes.com

While stories shouldn’t be edited to avoid ever offending anyone — or pabulum will ensue — editors do have to consider how readers might react.

The very real issues of economic inequality and racial strife in our society aren’t funny. But it’s also true that the most sensitive topics are the ones that comics often play on (with mixed success). Trevor Noah, among others, comes to mind.

The fact that the writer is a black man who often takes up these issues, in fiction and in criticism, carries weight here. And the story isn’t tone-deaf. In fact, it seems fully aware of what it’s wading into. Margaret Sullivan, in a post on The New York Times Public Editor’s Journal",REAL
A Dream Undone,"What changed this state of affairs was the passage, 50 years ago this month, of the Voting Rights Act. Signed on Aug. 6, 1965, it was meant to correct “a clear and simple wrong,” as Lyndon Johnson said. “Millions of Americans are denied the right to vote because of their color. This law will ensure them the right to vote.” It eliminated literacy tests and other Jim Crow tactics, and — in a key provision called Section 5 — required North Carolina and six other states with histories of black disenfranchisement to submit any future change in statewide voting law, no matter how small, for approval by federal authorities in Washington. No longer would the states be able to invent clever new ways to suppress the vote. Johnson called the legislation “one of the most monumental laws in the entire history of American freedom,” and not without justification. By 1968, just three years after the Voting Rights Act became law, black registration had increased substantially across the South, to 62 percent. Frye himself became a beneficiary of the act that same year when, after a close election, he became the first black state representative to serve in the North Carolina General Assembly since Reconstruction.

Photo

In the decades that followed, Frye and hundreds of other new black legislators built on the promise of the Voting Rights Act, not just easing access to the ballot but finding ways to actively encourage voting, with new state laws allowing people to register at the Department of Motor Vehicles and public-assistance offices; to register and vote on the same day; to have ballots count even when filed in the wrong precinct; to vote by mail; and, perhaps most significant, to vote weeks before Election Day. All of those advances were protected by the Voting Rights Act, and they helped black registration increase steadily. In 2008, for the first time, black turnout was nearly equal to white turnout, and Barack Obama was elected the nation’s first black president.

Since then, however, the legal trend has abruptly reversed. In 2010, Republicans flipped control of 11 state legislatures and, raising the specter of voter fraud, began undoing much of the work of Frye and subsequent generations of state legislators. They rolled back early voting, eliminated same-day registration, disqualified ballots filed outside home precincts and created new demands for photo ID at polling places. In 2013, the Supreme Court, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, directly countermanded the Section 5 authority of the Justice Department to dispute any of these changes in the states Section 5 covered. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, declared that the Voting Rights Act had done its job, and it was time to move on. Republican state legislators proceeded with a new round of even more restrictive voting laws.

All of these seemingly sudden changes were a result of a little-known part of the American civil rights story. It involves a largely Republican countermovement of ideologues and partisan operatives who, from the moment the Voting Rights Act became law, methodically set out to undercut or dismantle its most important requirements. The story of that decades-long battle over the iconic law’s tenets and effects has rarely been told, but in July many of its veteran warriors met in a North Carolina courthouse to argue the legality of a new state voting law that the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School has called one of the “most restrictive since the Jim Crow era.” The decision, which is expected later this year, could determine whether the civil rights movement’s signature achievement is still justified 50 years after its signing, or if the movement itself is finished.

I. 1865-1980

1. “States’ rights”

The fundamental promise of American democracy is that every citizen gets a vote, but delivering the franchise from on high and in the face of violent local opposition has always been a complicated legal proposition. The 13th Amendment freed the slaves, and the 14th Amendment gave them citizenship. But the key to Reconstruction was the 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870, which did something far more radical, not just guaranteeing (male) former slaves the right to vote but giving Congress the authority to enforce that right state by state, an authority that to this day many legislators see as a drastic intrusion into local affairs.

The new laws immediately enfranchised more than 700,000 black Southerners. Although blacks made up just 13 percent of the overall United States population, they made up 36 percent of the South’s population and a much higher percentage in some states, including a majority in Mississippi and South Carolina. Their enfranchisement was a shock to the political system that almost exclusively benefited Republicans, the party of Lincoln.

A Brief History of the Black Vote (Up to the Voting Rights Act)











Like its former Confederate neighbors, North Carolina sent several black Republicans to Congress. In the state’s General Assembly, legislators with the support of black Republicans wrote a new state Constitution in 1868 that created state-supported public schools; apportioned state representation based on population rather than wealth — a setback for the 1 percent of that era, the plantation owners; and, eventually, instituted a property tax.

Democrats throughout the South responded to the growing influence of black legislators with a brutal effort to suppress the black vote, enforced by the Ku Klux Klan and its many paramilitary imitators, who kept blacks from election polls at gunpoint and whipped or lynched many who resisted. The Southern Democrats ran on an open message of white supremacy and quickly retook statehouses, city halls and courthouses throughout the South. Within 15 years of the Civil War’s end, Reconstruction was just a memory. What followed was deconstruction: the era of Jim Crow, the poll tax, the literacy test, double primaries and a host of other mechanisms that blocked the black vote. For decades, most black citizens in the South had no practical right to vote.

Beginning in the 1950s, propelled by the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education to desegregate schools, by modern media portrayals of anti-black violence and by the growing nonviolent resistance movement led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Congress began to assert its electoral authority with a series of legislative fixes. With the bipartisan Civil Rights Act of 1957, it created a separate Department of Justice civil rights division and the United States Commission on Civil Rights to monitor and investigate civil rights abuses. The fight over the law’s passage was bitter. In a party split, Southern Democrats attacked it relentlessly as a violation of “states’ rights,” a justification their predecessors used to resist abolition. The law survived the longest filibuster in Senate history, by Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, but it was considerably weakened in the process.

Congress tried again with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a more powerful bill that ended legal segregation. But again, the segregationist Democrats who had for many years controlled the South watered down its voting provisions, leaving the poll tax and the literacy test in place. Thurmond, in a sign of things to come, left the Democratic Party entirely, switching his allegiance to the Republicans.

It took the Voting Rights Act, with its considerably stronger protections, to finally deliver the black franchise, 100 years after it was first promised. Its most extraordinary measure, the one that rankled Southern politicians the most, was Section 5. By naming specific states as bad actors that fell under special federal scrutiny, it was the ultimate affront to states’ rights. But under intense pressure, Lyndon Johnson was able to shepherd the bill into law. Its tough approach to knocking down barriers to voting, combined with a phasing in overseen by federal registrars who signed up voters throughout the South, brought about a sudden and significant increase in black voter registration — in Mississippi, black registration increased to 54 percent from 7 percent within three years. This second Reconstruction, with its second surge of Southern black voters, precipitated a second realignment of the parties, and with it an even more complex legal effort to undermine and ultimately undo the most powerful provisions of the Voting Rights Act.

2. “Evidence of natural racial distinctions”

“It all goes back to winning elections,” Carter Wrenn, a longtime North Carolina Republican strategist, told me in June. Wrenn fits the prototype of the Southern Political Strategist: He’s 63, round-faced, round-waisted and always seems to be on the verge of telling another too-good story from the bygone days of American politics. Sitting behind the wide desk in his Raleigh office, wearing sweats and puffing on a cigar, Wrenn explained the existential dilemma that confronted Southern Democrats back in the ’70s, when Wrenn started working in the mighty North Carolina political operation of Senator Jesse Helms.

After Reconstruction, Wrenn explained, the South reverted to complete Democratic control. Elections were decided in the Democratic primaries, which were often fought between the conservative wing and a more moderate wing. The passage of the Voting Rights Act upset that status quo. “What the Voting Rights Act did was brought very quickly a group of African-American voters into those primaries, and it tilted the balance to the progressives,” Wrenn said. “It tilted the playing field so much that by the ’70s, it was very unlikely a conservative was going to win a Democratic primary.”

Helms, a former Raleigh city councilman, had seen it coming. After the Democratic candidate he was supporting for governor lost the primary to a pro-integration opponent in 1960, he moved full-time into a new political realm — television punditry. Owl-eyed, balding and fiery, Helms became a popular on-air commentator for WRAL-TV, where he inveighed against a civil rights movement that was infested with “moral degenerates” and willfully blind to what he called “the purely scientific, statistical evidence of natural racial distinctions in group intellect.” In 1971, he registered as a Republican. Tom Ellis, a lawyer and close political adviser, suggested that he run for the United States Senate.

The electoral path for Southern Republicans was not at all clear back then. In 1966, 18 percent of North Carolina voters were registered Republicans. In 1972, the number was still just 22 percent. At the same time, Democrat registrations were hanging in at around 75 percent. To win, Helms would need to reach and convert a lot of unhappy Democrats.

Photo

Many national Republican politicians, Richard Nixon among them, also saw an opportunity in the racial dislocation of conservative Southern Democrats. A Quaker who helped shepherd Dwight Eisenhower’s Civil Rights Act of 1957 through the Senate, Nixon won the White House in 1968 by opposing the perils of court-ordered busing and (though he ultimately signed the Voting Rights Act’s reauthorization) the injustice of Section 5. His hard-edge, race-based appeal came to be known as the Southern strategy, an effective way for Republicans to win white voters in the South.

“Sometimes the way in which it was handled was legitimate,” Wrenn said. “Sometimes it was over the line.” The tactic immediately relinquished whatever good will black voters still had for the party of Lincoln, but this too helped Republicans, as the Nixon tactician Kevin Phillips explained in 1970. “The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South,” he said in an interview in The New York Times, “the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans.” Helms echoed some of Nixon’s themes in his 1972 race, and — running on the slogan “Jesse Helms: He’s One of Us” — easily smashed his Democratic opponent, Nick Galifianakis (uncle to the comedian Zach Galifianakis).

Why didn’t the Republicans, whose party was founded on outrage about racial injustice, instead try to rekindle their alliance with black voters? I posed the question to Wrenn. He sat back for a moment, reflective. In fact, he said, they thought about it. They asked their pollsters to identify some Republican positions that could appeal to black voters, and the pollsters found that some black voters might just be drawn by the party’s religiosity and its position on abortion. But the pollsters also found that, Abraham Lincoln and several generations of Jim Crow notwithstanding, black voters simply saw Democrats as more reliable allies after the passage of the Voting Rights Act. “Nothing else mattered,” Wrenn said. “Abortion didn’t matter. Religion didn’t matter. It was experience.” He sighed. “I may be dead wrong,” he added, almost as an afterthought. “Because one thing I’ve learned is that I do not understand the mind of the black voter.”

As for white voters, the Southern strategy worked. Helms won his next two races and provided a vast Southern support network for Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign team, which used many of the racial dog-whistle slogans that Helms had made a regular part of his campaign arsenal. In one of Reagan’s first campaign events following his nomination, he went to the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi — near where the Klan killed three civil rights workers 16 years earlier — and declared, “I believe in states’ rights.”

II. 1980-2000

3. “Zest for the colorblind society”

The 1980 election may have put Reagan in office with an ominous nod to “states’ rights,” but in that same year black voter registration reached 60 percent, black politicians were slowly but steadily winning public office and efforts by ideologues like Helms to undermine the Voting Rights Act had not been able to halt the progress it protected.

But a new threat to the act was just about to arrive in Washington, in the confident person of John Roberts Jr., a superstar young conservative legal scholar who retained the bearing of the prep-school football captain he once was. A Midwesterner from the all-American town of Long Beach, Ind., he graduated early from Harvard summa cum laude and went on to Harvard Law, where he was editor of The Harvard Law Review, before landing a plum Supreme Court clerkship with Justice William Rehnquist, a Nixon appointee.

Rehnquist’s chambers were a haven for aspiring young conservatives, “the closest place to the center of an emerging conservative legal movement,” writes Ari Berman in his new book about the voting rights movement, “Give Us the Ballot.” For years, Rehnquist had openly opposed the major legislative achievements of the civil rights era. When the justice was a young Supreme Court clerk himself, he wrote a memo agreeing with Plessy v. Ferguson’s “separate but equal” doctrine, which formed the bedrock legal justification for decades of segregation. (He later said the memo did not represent his true thinking.)

Shortly before Roberts came aboard as a clerk, Rehnquist helped decide a case that would mark the first major legal blow against the Voting Rights Act. The case, Mobile v. Bolden, involved a somewhat complicated argument about minority representation. The city of Mobile, Ala., was majority white, and the way it structured elections for its three-person city commission made it nearly impossible for black voters to gain a single seat. The commissioners were selected by a citywide, or “at-large,” election, putting black voters in the minority for every seat. The at-large system was inherently stacked against minorities, the plaintiffs argued, but there was a simple fix. If Mobile carved out three districts, each with a dedicated commissioner, and one of those districts was majority black, then black voters would have a better chance of electing a black commissioner.

Rehnquist and his fellow justices did not dispute the logic. Instead, they argued something new: that the plaintiffs failed to prove that Mobile set up the election system with the intention of shutting out blacks. This subtle distinction about intention created a new, often impossibly high bar for winning Voting Rights Act cases. It wasn’t enough to show that a law resulted in black voters being disenfranchised. Now the plaintiff also had to show “proof of intent.”

As a clerk, Roberts mostly drew dull cases to review — a disputed cattle transaction, the rightful tax status of a corporate hunting lodge — but later that year, when he took a prestigious new job as an assistant to Reagan’s attorney general, William French Smith, he would have much to say about the Mobile decision. Because the Voting Rights Act was coming up for renewal, a bipartisan group of senators and House members had taken the opportunity to work out a fix to undo the Supreme Court’s Mobile decision as part of the renewal package. The new rule would explicitly allow judges to find fault with any election law that resulted in minority disenfranchisement, no matter the intention. As a corrective to “proof of intent,” this “results test,” as it was known, would significantly strengthen the Voting Rights Act.

Many career civil rights attorneys at the Justice Department had no problem with the new rule. But Reagan’s political appointees, Roberts among them, had a new argument with profound implications: Justice should be colorblind. Roger Clegg, a lawyer who worked with Roberts during the Reagan years, described this new ethos in notably idealistic-sounding terms: “It’s a very bad thing for this country to have race-based decision making in any public transaction.”

It was the sort of argument that dismayed career civil rights attorneys. “In their zest for the colorblind society they professed to see, they didn’t recognize that the long couple hundred years of segregation and discrimination continued to have present-day effects,” one of those attorneys, J. Gerald Hebert, told me. “I would say they had a fundamental lack of understanding of the 14th and 15th Amendments, and what Congress could do under those amendments — I still don’t think Roberts understands it.”

In his new position, Roberts was a leading voice against the results test. In memos to the attorney general, he argued that discrimination cases should be hard to prove, given that they can lead to “the most intrusive interference imaginable by the federal courts into state and local processes.” The results test, he said, would “establish essentially a quota system for electoral politics” — and “just as we oppose quotas in employment and education, so too we oppose them in elections.” (At the time, 19 black representatives were serving in a House class of 435.)

But as Roberts pressed his case, a powerful opponent, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, was working against him. Dole, who voted for the Voting Rights Act in 1965, thought the Reagan team’s ideological fervor put the party’s efforts to build a broad, winning coalition of voters at risk. His argument prevailed, and Reagan ultimately signed the strengthened version of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, with the new standard for bringing discrimination cases intact. “I tried to make the point to the White House that, as a party, we needed to demonstrate that we cared and were concerned about votes from African-Americans and Hispanics,” Dole, now 92, told me earlier this summer. “I don’t know where we lost track after Abraham Lincoln.”

4. “Sort of an ‘aha’ moment”

In July, Edward Blum, at ease in his newly constructed four-bedroom home on the placid western coast of Maine’s Penobscot Bay, explained why, to his mind, Americans ultimately embraced the Voting Rights Act. “It was the idea that your race should not be something that is used to help you in life or used to harm you in life,” he said. And that was the problem now, Blum told me. That was the very reason he was putting so much energy into trying to unravel those laws. Over the years, he said, “just the opposite evolved; race becomes everything.”

Blum, slightly built and wearing khakis and a Polo fleece, was sitting in his home office, his golden retriever barking outside at a passing kayaker. The scene was almost as far removed from the voting battlegrounds of the American South as could be imagined. And yet it is from this bucolic Northeastern setting that Blum has mounted some of the fiercest attacks on civil rights legislation to date. In the days before we spoke, the Supreme Court agreed to hear his challenges to race-based college admissions and the inclusion of noncitizens in the population tallies used to determine local districting.

It all started in 1992, when Blum, then working in Houston as a stockbroker, decided to make a novice run for Congress, for the seat once held by the civil rights icon Barbara Jordan. To campaign in such a district as a white conservative marked Blum as “somewhat of a kook,” he conceded, but the incumbent Democratic congressman, Craig Washington, who is black, had considerable political vulnerabilities. While in office, he had filed for personal bankruptcy; admitted to breaking his marriage vows with two separate women; and confessed to having been involved in a domestic altercation with one of them. But whatever chance Blum — who peppers his speech with a “meshuga” here and a “bubbameister” there — had was undercut by his actual platform, which was centered on tax cuts and, as The Houston Chronicle described it, “ending welfare for able-bodied adults.” Blum lost.

The thing that bothered Blum most about losing, he said, was that the district adhered to no obvious geographical concept of what a community should look like. The crazy shape was a result of the obscure and often maddeningly complex art of redistricting. The Texas Legislature redraws its congressional districts every 10 years, based on the latest census population figures. In most states, the party in power controls the redistricting process and tends to do it in a way that configures as many of those districts as possible to have majorities of its own loyal voters. That might mean stretching a district line here or there to make a district where a majority of voters is reliably for your party, a process called gerrymandering. After 1965, though, partisan mapmakers also had to be mindful not to violate the Voting Rights Act. They could only rarely draw lines that reduced minority participation, and they had an affirmative duty under certain conditions to create “minority-majority” districts, where blacks or Latinos made up the majority. “You had these fingers and tributaries reaching out to pick up these little pockets of minority voters,” Blum told me, grimacing.

Not long after his defeat, Blum read an article in The New York Times, about a case in which the plaintiffs challenged a similarly complex system of drawing districts, that gave the practice a name: racial gerrymandering.

“That was sort of an ‘aha’ moment,” Blum said.

The case, as it happened, started in North Carolina. Robinson Everett, a Duke law professor, filed a suit, later joined by the wealthy libertarian-leaning former state representative Art Pope, that involved two new black-majority congressional districts. One district spanned 160 miles and, at one point, was no wider than the I-85 expressway. A Wall Street Journal editorial labeled this redistricting “political pornography,” but the new shape also led to the election of Melvin Watt, one of the first black congressmen from North Carolina since Reconstruction.

Everett, in the case, ultimately called Shaw v. Reno, made an argument that John Roberts Jr. would have cheered: In devising the district, the state had created “a racial quota system” for elections that segregated voters based on race. In his argument, he also proposed a more intriguing — and, for the Voting Rights Act, more threatening — premise: the principle of a “colorblind constitution.”

By that time, Rehnquist had been named chief justice. His court sided with Everett. From then on, considerations of race in redistricting, while required by the Voting Rights Act, could not be used to create districts that bore “an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid,” Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote in the majority opinion. While the logic of the decision was somewhat muddled — political geography had never been especially neat — it was the first serious limit on the expansive powers of Section 5. And it drew its authority not from any racist ideology but from the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

With Shaw v. Reno, Blum found inspiration. He filed a similar suit in Texas, and his case also went all the way up to the Supreme Court, which nullified the redistricting plan he challenged. Blum had a new career. “All I had to do was take that doctrine, and that legal team, and begin suing other congressional plans,” he said. “So we sued New York, took the team to other states: Virginia, South Carolina.” In short order, he became one of the Voting Rights Act’s most effective opponents. He hunted for plaintiffs the old-fashioned way, paging through a hard copy of the Almanac of American Politics and dead-tree phone books to find frustrated former candidates like himself. “The predicate behind all of this,” he said, was: “This can’t be right; this can’t be right.”

5. “A vast voter registration machine”

On the 25th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, in 1990, there were celebrations throughout the South and state-of-the-black-vote reports on television. In Washington, Congress unanimously passed a joint resolution declaring Aug. 6 “Voting Rights Celebration Day.” George Bush signed it three days later, saying, “We must never underestimate the importance of a single vote.”

But the movement against the trend of making voting easier that began with the original act’s signing was entering a new phase. Democrats were pushing for a new law to increase registration, known as the “motor-voter bill,” which would require states to provide registration forms at motor vehicle departments and other government agencies, such as public-assistance offices. Republicans resisted. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned that the bill would “turn every agency, bureau and office of state government into a vast voter registration machine,” resulting in “political couch potatoes” driven to polls on union buses. Bush vetoed the law when it arrived on his desk in the summer of 1992, the middle of the presidential campaign, declaring that it would “expose the election process to an unacceptable risk of fraud and corruption.”

Still, Clinton signed it quickly upon taking office the following year. It was an easy choice. “He stood to gain tremendously,” as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a longtime advocate for the law, told me. Indeed, following its passage, black registered voters increased 10 percent by 1998, and those new voters would go on to become a boon to Clinton and the Democrats, especially in the South. Nonetheless, a new front had been opened in the battle over voting rights, which combined old-school Jesse Helms attacks on the character of black voters with a new, high-minded concern about fraud.

In-person voter fraud — in which you impersonate someone or try to vote more than once, or at all if you are ineligible — is almost entirely nonexistent in the United States. (An exhaustive Loyola Law School study could find only 31 “credible allegations of fraud” in a one-billion-vote sample.) But election fraud — ballot stuffing, vote buying, machine rigging — is not unheard-of, and in that shade of distinction lay an important new development.

In 1997, the year after Clinton was re-elected, Miami was confronted with a spectacular case of genuine election fraud, when it was revealed that Xavier Suárez had clinched the mayoralty with the help of hundreds of absentee ballots bearing the names of dead people, felons and other ineligible voters. Suárez himself was never charged, but eventually more than 50 people were arrested, and an appellate court threw out the absentee ballots, forcing Suárez to step down from office.

The case set Florida legislators on an aggressive and hasty effort to reform the state’s voting system. One proposed law made it harder to certify an absentee ballot. (The Justice Department blocked much of the law under the Voting Rights Act, determining that some restrictions would fall more heavily on blacks and Hispanics than whites.) The state also hired a data firm called DBT to scrub the names of any dead people or felons from its voter rolls.

Conservative lawmakers nationwide, sometimes citing the motor-voter bill, were increasingly vocal about fraud, and the distinction between in-person voter fraud and actual election fraud was often lost in the heat. Contributing to that confusion was a group formed in 1996 in Virginia, the Voting Integrity Project, known as V.I.P. One member of the group’s advisory board was an obscure elections official out of Georgia named Hans von Spakovsky, who would become a central figure in the campaign against fraud.

Von Spakovsky first became active in politics as a particularly assertive chairman of his local homeowners’ association. After a stint as a poll watcher, he became obsessed with the specter of voter fraud and the idea that every voter should have to show photographic identification at polls. He began writing in small conservative journals on the need for states and counties to scrub felons and dead people from their voter rolls, which led to a seat on the board of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections in Georgia — and also caught the eye of V.I.P.

V.I.P. ostensibly offered its services to all comers, but it tended to investigate Democrats. Its first big case came in Louisiana. When the Democrat Mary Landrieu defeated the Republican Woody Jenkins by a narrow margin in the 1996 Senate race, Republicans called in V.I.P., which reported that Landrieu’s election was a result of a complex fraud scheme. A Senate committee investigated and instead found evidence that a Jenkins operative may have coached the witnesses, four of whom recanted. The Senate inquiry determined that there was “no evidence of an organized, widespread effort to secure fraudulent votes.”

Many election fraud scandals involved absentee ballots, and V.I.P. often criticized lax absentee ballot rules, but it was particularly concerned, like Von Spakovsky, with persuading states and counties to purge their voter rolls of dead people and felons. (According to N.Y.U.’s Brennan Center, in the United States, various state voting laws have disenfranchised nearly six million felons.) V.I.P. determined that some municipalities didn’t have the resources to remove ineligible voters, so it formed a partnership with DBT — the same company Florida hired following the Miami mayoral debacle — and announced in a news release that the company would come to “small communities to scrub their voter rolls ‘free of charge.’ ”

The urge to clean up voter rolls is understandable, of course, but in practice it can have an undesirable effect, as the world would soon learn. DBT’s work for Florida entailed combing through the state rolls for possible felons and then forwarding the results to local election officials throughout the state. However, multiple investigations would later determine that DBT incorrectly flagged thousands of people on the lists, and that a disproportionate number of them were black voters, more than 90 percent of whom voted for Al Gore. Estimates for how many of those voters were wrongly turned away from polls range from roughly 1,000 to many times that.

The mishandled felons purge was only one of many mishaps that plagued the presidential election in Florida that year, when some 180,000 votes were rejected because of either poorly designed ballots or challenges from lawyers during the recount. A New York Times review that year found that of the ballots that were thrown out in the Florida election, three times as many came from black voting precincts as from white voting precincts.

III. 2000-13

6. “Right-thinking Americans”

The 2000 election fiasco drew nationwide bipartisan calls for election reform. Congress set out to draft a new law to avoid a repeat, and the Bush Justice Department turned to the conservative expert on elections to help guide its role in the legislative process — Hans von Spakovsky.

Von Spakovsky told me that he applied for the job when he heard that the new attorney general, John Ashcroft, was creating a unit to lead the Justice Department’s effort on the bill. “It was basically a blind application,” Von Spakovsky said. “When I got hired, there wasn’t anybody in Washington who knew who the hell I was.”

The final, bipartisan version of the law — the Help America Vote Act, passed in 2002 — mandated voting booth upgrades and provided protection for voters whose names were wrongly removed from registration rolls, as so many were in Florida. (It requires states to allow those who show up at polls and learn they do not appear on the voting rolls to cast provisional ballots.) But the act also raised the criminal penalties for the willful inclusion of false information on registration forms, like filing one on behalf of a nonexistent person, or claiming to live in a voting precinct where one does not, in fact, reside. Another provision required those who registered by mail to later prove their identities at polling stations or state election offices with photo identification, a utility bill or a bank statement.

By then, it was becoming clear that the Bush administration was picking up where the Reagan- and Bush-era Justice Department left off. One of Bush’s tactics was to pack the Commission on Civil Rights with a conservative majority. His administration was hardly the first to mold the commission to its ideology, but it did so in a new way: Avoiding rules barring a president from appointing more than four commissioners from his or her party, two Republican appointees re-registered as independents. The move cleared the way for Bush to add two new Republicans, effectively giving the commission a 6-2 split. Bush made Abigail Thernstrom, a respected conservative author who had been questioning the role of Section 5 since the 1980s, its vice chairwoman.

Von Spakovsky quickly moved up in the Justice Department, and by 2002 he was advising on cases and policy at the voting section of the civil rights division. There he found common cause with the Bush-appointed acting head of the division, Bradley Schlozman. What followed, Von Spakovsky said, was “a clash between folks like me who really believe that the Voting Rights Act needs to be applied in a race-neutral manner and the folks who had been there a long time who saw it, frankly, as a way of helping only minority voters, and in particular, helping one political party.”

In 2004, the new leadership assigned a case against the majority-black county of Noxubee, Miss., for “relentless voting-related racial discrimination” against white voters — the first case ever brought by the Justice Department on behalf of white voters. When some division lawyers chafed at the decision, Schlozman decided to try to quell the dissent by conducting an aggressive — and, an inspector general’s report later found, illegal — effort to hire like-minded attorneys and to marginalize or get rid of career attorneys the Bush team saw as too liberal. In emails, Schlozman boasted: “My tentative plan to is to gerrymander all of those crazy libs right out of the section” and to replace them with “right-thinking Americans.”

One of these was J. Christian Adams, who had endeared himself to conservatives by seeking the disbarment of Hillary Clinton’s brother Hugh Rodham for representing felons seeking pardons during his brother-in-law’s presidency. Another was John Tanner, a career Justice Department attorney who joked in an email with Schlozman that he liked his coffee “Mary Frances Berry-style — black and bitter,” referring to the Democrat who headed the United States Commission on Civil Rights under Bill Clinton. Still another was Chris Coates, a former A.C.L.U. lawyer who, Schlozman wrote, had become “a very different man” and was now “a true member of the team.” Not making the cut was a black lawyer who, Schlozman complained in an email, wrote in “ebonics” and, in his opinion, was hired as “an affirmative-action thing.”

It was in that toxic environment, in 2005, that Georgia submitted for approval a new type of strict voter-ID law. As it happened, the law comported with legislation Von Spakovsky described in a law-journal article he had recently published under a pen name, Publius. But a voting-division review team report — later leaked to The Washington Post — suggested that the department block the law. Black voters were considerably less likely to have any of the required IDs than whites were. According to the report, a prime sponsor of the bill, State Representative Sue Burmeister, told the review team that if the law diminished black voting, that was only because it shut down opportunities for fraud; black voters, the report paraphrased her as saying, were less likely to vote if they were not being paid to do so. A state judge ultimately invalidated the law, citing the plain language of the Georgia Constitution — “there is nothing equivocal about the words ‘shall be entitled to vote’ ” — and Georgia was forced to revise it. (The revised version provided free voter identification cards to those who needed them, and the Georgia Supreme Court upheld it.)

Still, when the Voting Rights Act went up for reauthorization in 2006, Von Spakovsky told me, he argued at the Justice Department that “the evidence very clearly showed it was no longer needed.” Blum, Clegg and Thernstrom made the same argument, on the Hill and with Karl Rove at the White House. But Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years, after it passed unanimously in the Senate and with only 33 “no” votes in the House. Signing the reauthorization that July, Bush declared, “My administration will vigorously enforce the provisions of this law, and we will defend it in court.”

7. “It worked on a whole bunch of levels.”

Eric Holder Jr.’s apartment in downtown Washington is a study in modern minimalism, with floor-to-ceiling windows, low-rise Italian furniture and zero clutter. Its sense of orderliness is at odds with the chaos of the last six years of his life, as the first black attorney general of the United States.

It was a few weeks after his final day as attorney general, and Holder was dressed down in a Washington-casual outfit of jeans and a perfectly pressed white button-down. Leaning back in his chair, he explained to me how he had come into the Justice Department with a mission to “restore” the civil rights division following the turbulent Bush years. “I knew things had gotten bad at the civil rights division,” he told me. “But I was really surprised,” he said, “at how bad things had become.”

Just two weeks before Obama’s inauguration, Chris Coates, the former A.C.L.U. attorney whom Schlozman had called “a true member of the team,” and J. Christian Adams, an ally, had rushed through a new case that involved an Election Day run-in at a Philadelphia polling station. According to a Department of Justice report, for about an hour, two members of the New Black Panther Party, a diffuse militant black group not affiliated with the original Black Panther Party, stood menacingly outside the station, predominantly used by blacks. Both were dressed in paramilitary apparel, one was carrying a billy club and, one witness said, they were calling whites “crackers” who would soon be “ruled by the black man.” A white poll watcher with a video camera confronted them, and the footage was played repeatedly on Fox News. Coates charged them and the New Black Panther Party under Section 11 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits polling place harassment.

Holder had rehired several attorneys and analysts who left the voting section during the Bush years, and the newly rejuvenated civil rights lawyers and other staff members advocated reducing the charges in the case. The reasons were straightforward. No witnesses had come forward to say they were dissuaded from voting; the New Black Panther Party publicly disavowed the men on its website; one of the men was a certified poll watcher. In addition, the Justice Department had not brought a case in a similar situation in Pima, Ariz., when four white members of an anti-illegal-immigration group, one of them with a holstered gun, showed up at a majority-Hispanic polling station wearing military gear. But dispensing with the case would not be easy.

Looking back on it now, Holder said he viewed the New Black Panther case as a poison pill left behind as a sort of test by the outgoing regime: “It was almost like, ‘We dare you to do something with this.’ ” He said he decided to back the career staff members who wanted to drop the charges. “I also thought in the back of my mind, All right, this is going to create a bit of a firestorm, a political firestorm, but hey, career people made a cogent argument — they were just briefing me — and I said, ‘That’s fine.’ ” The Justice Department moved ahead with reduced charges against only one of the men, the one with the billy club, winning an order that he not return to a polling station with a weapon through 2013.

Conservative media outrage ensued. The United States Commission on Civil Rights, then still overwhelmingly conservative, conducted its own investigation and declared, “There is considerable evidence of a culture of hostility to the race-neutral enforcement of the law.” Its star witnesses were Coates and Adams, who stepped forward on Fox News as a “whistle blower.” Later a Department of Justice inspector general’s report said the New Black Panther Party decision was handled properly. But all of that was lost in the conservative media coverage. The reports mixed with others about how several members of the community organizing group Acorn — which Obama helped to sue Illinois to implement the motor-voter law in the 1990s — were indicted on a charge of filing false voter registrations on behalf of nonexistent voters, in order to pad their work hours. The story line, combined with that of the New Black Panther Party, painted a picture in the conservative news media of a president who owed his election to nefarious black vote fraudsters.

How serious was this misconception? A year after Obama’s election, the Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling released a survey showing that 52 percent of Republicans believed “Acorn stole the presidential election for Barack Obama last year, with only 27 percent granting that he won it legitimately.” Republican legislators were increasingly calling for measures to prevent in-person voter fraud, though evidence that any existed in any substantial way remained nil. “It worked on a whole bunch of levels,” Holder said. “And I think that’s why they decided to do what they did.”

8. “A drastic departure”

In 2010, Republican legislators — propelled by Tea Party anger, new sources of outside conservative money and a precision plan devised by the strategists Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie — increased the number of statehouses they fully controlled to 25 from 14. In 2011, Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin passed new voter-ID laws. The North Carolina General Assembly passed one that year as well but could not overcome a veto by Gov. Bev Perdue, a Democrat. In 2012, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia followed with their own. The laws were strikingly similar. “It’s really, really unheard-of, or really rare, to have states move en masse all of the sudden to pass photocopied laws all at once without a national crisis,” said Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, which has kept careful track of the new laws. There had not been this many restrictive voting laws in the states, Waldman said, “since the Jim Crow era.”

But by Election Day of 2012, most of the laws had been temporarily suspended, and some were blocked outright. In Texas, a federal court, quoting an earlier case, ruled that the state’s harsh voter-ID law was likely to “lead to a ‘retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.’ ” Section 5, once again, had worked, and in 2012, for the first time in American history, the black turnout rate exceeded the white turnout rate, by two percentage points.

Three days after Obama’s re-election, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the constitutionality of Section 5, this time on behalf of Shelby County, Ala., one of whose hamlets the Department of Justice had blocked from eliminating the seat of its sole black lawmaker. The suit came from none other than Edward Blum.

Blum had moved on from challenging districts to challenging Section 5 itself. In 2006, he filed his first suit, on behalf of a small utility board in Austin that had no real effect on minority voting rights but, because it had a publicly elected board and was located in Texas, fell under Section 5 provisions. The suit failed to draw the Supreme Court into the question, though John Roberts Jr., now chief justice, had left the door open to doing so: “Whether conditions continue to justify such legislation is a difficult constitutional question we do not answer today,” he wrote.

Photo

His Shelby decision, rendered on June 25, 2013, answered that difficult constitutional question in the negative, striking down the formula for Section 5 coverage contained in Section 4. Echoing the language of his Reagan Justice Department memos from more than 30 years earlier, Roberts called Section 5 “a drastic departure from basic principles of federalism” that had since served its purpose. “History did not end in 1965,” Roberts wrote. “Largely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were abolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout due to race were erased and African-Americans attained political office in record numbers.”

When Blum heard about the decision, he was overjoyed. “I wept,” he said.

Roberts’s decision prompted an unusually fiery response from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In her dissent, she noted that in studying the law’s reauthorization in 2006, “Congress found there were more D.O.J. objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than there were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization (490).” She noted that in a majority of those objections, the Justice Department cited “calculated decisions to keep minority voters from fully participating in the political process.” She pointed to a study that found that covered states and counties accounted for 56 percent of all successful discrimination cases brought under Section 2 of the law — which applies equally in all states — though they contained 25 percent of the nation’s population. And she read from F.B.I. transcripts involving a case in Alabama regarding a possible ballot proposition on gambling that some Republican lawmakers worried would cause a spike in the turnout of blacks, whom they referred to as “aborigines” who would arrive at polls in “HUD-financed buses.”

“These conversations occurred not in the 1870s or even in the 1960s — they took place in 2010,” Ginsburg wrote. “ ‘Hubris’ is a fit word for today’s demolition of the V.R.A.”

IV. 2013-15

9. “History has a way of repeating itself.”

The effects of the Shelby decision were immediate. Late in the evening of July 22, 2013, the Democrats on the North Carolina General Assembly Rules Committee received their copies of a new version of House Bill 589, which was due for a vote the following day. Three months earlier, the House passed the original H.B. 589. It was a short voter-ID bill, allowing for a wider range of IDs — including state-college IDs — than other laws of its kind, and incorporated provisions that would help those who did not have an appropriate ID to get one free. The bill had been extensively vetted in hearings that took place over weeks but had curiously sat dormant after its passage by the House. Just after the Shelby decision, the senator in charge of the Rules Committee, Tom Apodaca, said, cryptically, “Now we can go with the full bill,” and expressed relief that the “headache” was out of the way.

State Senator Josh Stein was sitting in his kitchen in Raleigh when the email with the new legislation came through. “My jaw hit the table,” he recalled. He quickly understood what Apodaca had meant. The bill had grown to 57 pages from 14, with 48 additional sections that cut the state’s early-voting period nearly in half, taking away one of the two Sundays when black churches run highly effective “souls to the polls” voting drives. It ended same-day registration and invalidated student IDs for voting. In its one act designed to improve voter access, the bill made it easier to vote by absentee ballot. None of this could have been approved under Section 5. The email indicated that the Rules Committee would vote the following morning.

The bill alarmed North Carolina’s black legislators, some of whom had worked for decades to make the state a model for inclusive voting law. They saw in it a reflection of the failed Reconstruction years. “History has a way of repeating itself,” said Representative Henry Michaux Jr., who joined the North Carolina General Assembly in 1972, “and that’s exactly what’s happening here.”

A Brief History of the Black Vote (After the Voting Rights Act)











The new bill had many authors, literal and spiritual, among the generations of civil rights antagonists. There was Von Spakovsky, who testified during hearings for the earlier version of the bill that while he was not claiming North Carolina suffered from massive voter fraud, the potential for abuse existed. Tom Farr, a lawyer who spent many years working with the Helms organization, helped drafters of the bill in the House to sort through Department of Motor Vehicles data on distribution of driver’s licenses by race (blacks were more likely than whites not to have one, it showed). The Civitas Institute, which Pope co-founded, had been pushing for the provision ending same-day registration and shortening the early-voting period. (Pope told me he had no hand in the foundation’s work and hadn’t given the new law much thought.) The law’s provision removing student IDs, even those issued by state schools, from the list of acceptable identification had been championed by the newly formed Voter Integrity Project, a local group unaffiliated with Von Spakovsky’s Voting Integrity Project. “We are approaching it from a philosophical position,” Jay DeLancy, the group’s co-founder, told me. “There is fraud. How do you mitigate it?” Emails that would later emerge in court showed that in lobbying for another bill restricting student registration, DeLancy told lawmakers that, if successful, “it will shift the landscape of college-town voting all across the nation.”

Within two days, the law passed both chambers without a single Democratic vote. As he cast his “no” vote on the House floor, Michaux said, “You can take these 57 pages of abomination and confine them to the streets of hell for all eternity.”

The Justice Department, the N.A.A.C.P., the A.C.L.U., the League of Women Voters and a group of college students filed lawsuits, which were joined together in this summer’s trial, under the name of North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. v. McCrory.

To justify the bill’s necessity, supporters pointed to an audit the state conducted last year under a new provision of the law that requires it to crosscheck its voting rolls with those of other states. It had identified 35,000 potential double registrations. The state’s division of elections commissioner, Kim Strach — whose husband is on the state team defending the law — told lawmakers, “It could be voter fraud,” though she acknowledged the possible duplicates could also be related to common bureaucratic errors. The commentator Dick Morris, speaking on Fox, said it probably meant there were more than one million double votes nationwide in 2012. Von Spakovsky told The Tampa Bay Times it seemed as if North Carolina had found at least several hundred people who voted twice.

A few weeks before the case was to go to trial, I stopped into the Statehouse office of State Senator Bob Rucho, a prime supporter of the bill. “When the people start losing confidence in their government, and the electoral process, then something needs to be done to restore it,” he told me. But when I called the Board of Elections recently, a spokesman told me that the number of suspicious registrations was now 11; none had so far produced a criminal fraud charge.

10. “This is our Selma.”

On July 12, the Sunday before North Carolina N.A.A.C.P. v. McCrory was to open, the Rev. William Barber II, president of the statewide N.A.A.C.P. organization, gathered more than 1,200 supporters and allies in the center of Winston-Salem for an evening prayer service beneath the vaulted ceilings of the Union Baptist Church.

Barber, 51, has a striking presence. More than six feet tall, broad-chested and slightly hunched from a congenital spinal condition, he speaks with a booming and practiced moral indignation. For two years, since the Republicans took control of the state, he has been running regular “Moral Monday” protests at the Statehouse. He argues that the nation is in the throes of “a third Reconstruction,” and that new voting laws like the one in North Carolina are an attempt at a third deconstruction. The old-guard members of the state’s civil rights movement view him as their rightful heir. (“He’s doing a great job,” Michaux said.) Republicans view him as a “demagogue,” as Wrenn called him.

As the sun began a hazy descent that Sunday, four generations of civil rights activists filed into the church, led by the grande dame of the trial, Rosanell Eaton, 94, a black N.A.A.C.P. plaintiff who defiantly trumped the system as a young woman by memorizing the preamble of the Constitution and then acing the literacy test in which she was asked to recite it. Wearing a black-and-white church dress, a veiled black hat and full makeup, she told me the new law offended her deeply. “It’s disgusting,” she said, spitting out the word like stale gum.

Barber approached the lectern in a bright fuchsia shirt and red prayer shawl. He ticked through the dramatic, violent history of the 1950s and 1960s that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act with a religious-political rage. He then led his congregation through the fairly technical business of Capitol Hill lawmaking and Supreme Court law striking.

“After a black president had won two elections, five justices arrogantly said they knew more than the evidence considered by 98 senators,” he said. “Then on June 25 — a day that will go down in political infamy — they voted to gut Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, and thereby nullified preclearance under Section 5 — which meant, on June 26, 2013, we had less voting rights than they had on August 6, 1965.” The crowd still with him, hooting and clapping, he shouted with the full capacity of his abdomen his catchphrase for the trial: “Like those who answered Dr. King’s call 50 years ago, THIS … IS … OUR … SELMA … NOW!”

Selma, in this case, was a heavily fortified, wood-paneled federal courtroom in Winston-Salem. The next morning it was filled with the lawyers from the five legal teams, including that of the Justice Department. The plaintiff’s lead attorney was Penda Hair, co-director of the civil rights group Advancement Project. In her opening argument, she said the voting laws established in the many decades since the Voting Rights Act had helped blacks and Latinos to vote. Removing those laws would affect those same people disproportionately. Quoting Barber, she repeated, “This is our Selma.”

After all of the plaintiffs had their say, Tom Farr took the lectern. He is gray-haired and slightly stooped, projecting a courtroom aura of rumpled annoyance. “What is the dastardly thing that North Carolina has done that has been equated to the events in Selma?” he asked the judge.

He argued that the law had no disparate effect; that blacks were no less welcome to vote than whites were during a shortened early-voting period, were treated no worse for voting at the wrong precinct than whites — the idea being that the past was the past. This, in essence, is what many of the arguments against the Voting Rights Act have always come down to.

The sun was beating down hard when court broke that day. Outside, Barber had gathered a few thousand protesters, including some legends of the old movement, like Joseph McNeil, one of the four students who started the Woolworth’s sit-in, and Bob Zellner, the first white field secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. As the protest made its orderly way down Main Street, with the police directing traffic, I couldn’t help thinking about the words of Farr’s co-counsel, Butch Bowers. “The history of North Carolina,” he said, “is not on trial here.” These thousands of people certainly did not agree.

They most likely would have found more to agree with in an observation Henry Frye made to me, sitting on his porch two days before the trial started. “It’s not quite what it was a long time ago,” he said. Pondering for a minute, he laughed and added, “It’s more sophisticated now.”",REAL
Who Runs the Streets of New Orleans?,"A Polaris turned the corner within two minutes, or 26 minutes faster than the N.O.P.D.’s average response time for the district. At the sight of the flashing blue lights, the men put their guns away and scattered.

‘‘Crazy, right?’’ Torres later said. ‘‘I kind of felt like Bruce Wayne.’’

In the United States, private police officers currently outnumber their publicly funded counterparts by a ratio of roughly three to one. Whereas in past decades the distinction was often clear — the rent-a-cop vs. the real cop — today the boundary between the two has become ‘‘messy and complex,’’ according to a study last year by Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Torres’s task force is best understood in this context, one where the larger merging of private and public security has resulted in an extensive retooling of the nation’s policing as a whole. As municipal budgets have stagnated or plummeted, state and local governments have taken to outsourcing police work to the private sector, resulting in changes that have gone largely unnoticed by the public they’re tasked with protecting.

A recent report by the Justice Department, which has become one of the most prominent advocates of such collaborative efforts, identified 450 partnerships in the country between law enforcement and the private sector. Nationwide, there are now more than 1,200 ‘‘business improvement districts’’ in which businesses pay self-imposed taxes to fund improved services, including security. In many cases, officers covered by corporate entities have become indistinguishable from those paid for by taxpayers. Last year, Facebook entered into a three-year partnership with the Menlo Park, Calif., Police Department in which the social-media giant agreed to pay the $194,000 salary of a police officer whose job was going to be cut. One of the largest private security forces in the nation today is the University of Chicago Police, which has full jurisdiction over 65,000 residents, only 15,000 of whom are students. More than 100 public housing projects in Boston are patrolled by private security, including one company that has been authorized to arrest suspects under certain circumstances.

Torres’s security detail is unique not just in the prominence of its beat — a major American city’s most-visited neighborhood — but also in the fact that it was conceptualized and financed by a single individual, with government support. Staffed by off-duty N.O.P.D. officers in vehicles that bear the N.O.P.D.’s star-and-crescent logo, the force became part of a larger initiative for public-private policing that Mitch Landrieu, the city’s mayor since 2010, had been working to put in place since the shooting on Bourbon Street last summer. In addition to Torres’s force, set to run for a two-month pilot, Landrieu brought in as many as 60 new State Police troopers in the city, paying their salaries through the end of the year with a $2.5 million grant from the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. While critics argue that such plans undermine traditional police departments and heighten the fragile socioeconomic and racial tensions that already plague urban policing, Landrieu, a progressive Democrat, presented it as part of New Orleans’s newfound embrace of entrepreneurial innovation. ‘‘We all have skin in the game,’’ the mayor said at a news conference announcing the plan, ‘‘so I’m confident this will be successful.’’

Nevertheless, Landrieu’s path to working with Torres was contentious, to say the least. Back in January, following the robbery of his home and the neighboring bar, Torres produced a television ad squarely blaming the mayor for the recent crime wave. ‘‘The French Quarter is under siege by criminals,’’ it began, with Torres himself, who spent $100,000 to air the ad prominently statewide over the next month, providing the voice-over narration. ‘‘We should hold the administration accountable for the failures of not protecting the French Quarter.’’ It was a message that resonated with the neighborhood’s 4,000 residents, a predominantly white and wealthy subset of a city with a majority black population. The week his ads began airing, a hundred or so people gathered for an anti-crime rally in Jackson Square, the city’s historic center, where some waved placards printed with the words WELCOME TO LANDRIEUVILLE! HOME OF ROBBERS, STABBERS & RAPISTS! Dozens of homeowners in the neighborhood had taken to hanging signs from their wrought-iron balconies reading CAUTION. WALK IN LARGE GROUPS. WE ♥ NOPD. WE JUST NEED MORE. Because Torres had the means to express these collective frustrations on air, he quickly became something of a neighborhood folk hero, albeit one with a Gulfstream jet. ‘‘He was giving voice to what everyone had been saying for months,’’ said Meg Lousteau, the executive director of Vieux Carré Property Owners, Residents and Associates, a preservationist group. ‘‘The whole groundswell wasn’t about just one neighborhood, but an expression that something in the city was deeply, deeply wrong.’’

Crime has dropped to record lows in most major American cities, but New Orleans, where wealthy neighborhoods sit side by side with some of the nation’s poorest, continues to struggle. The persistence of crime today stands as the most dominant threat to the resurgent image the city has had since Katrina. Though the murder rate has been in decline, it is still second in the nation, just below Detroit. Nonfatal shootings rose 23 percent last year, leading criminologists to argue that any decline in murders had more to do with advances in emergency medicine, not law enforcement. And with 107 homicides recorded so far this year, the current rate is on pace to increase for the first time in three years, potentially by as much as 20 percent. Meanwhile, over the past few years, other types of violent crime — assault, rape, armed robbery — have risen, some by more than 30 percent, giving credence to Torres’s image of a French Quarter ‘‘under siege.’’ As Peter Scharf, a professor of criminology at the Louisiana State University School of Public Health, explained: ‘‘What happened is that the residents of the Quarter, who have always had great unease with their more impoverished and sometimes violent neighbors, have realized that there is no Green Zone that will protect them from the reality of the city. Whether he meant to or not, Sidney brought up some issues that a lot of people are uncomfortable thinking about. Is the French Quarter a present-day Brooklyn Heights, or is it Bedford-Stuyvesant in the ’70s?’’

Responding to Torres’s attack ads, Landrieu presented Torres with something of a schoolyard dare — one that would ultimately lead the mayor to grant a private citizen extraordinary influence over matters of public safety. ‘‘He made millions and millions and millions of dollars off garbage contracts in the French Quarter,’’ Landrieu remarked on a local news channel. ‘‘Maybe he should just take some of that money and do it himself, if he thinks it’s so easy.’’

Three months later, on an evening in early April, Torres, dressed in skinny jeans and a flowing linen shirt, sat grinning at an outdoor table of an Italian restaurant in the Quarter. ‘‘When the mayor said that thing about me putting my money were my mouth is, I didn’t plan on any of this,’’ he recalled. His decision to take Landrieu up on his challenge was, in Torres’s view, similar to the circumstances under which he founded his sanitation company. In 2005, after Katrina hit, Torres was housing emergency medical workers in the hotels he owned at the time; trash collection had yet to resume, so he rented a truck to haul his garbage to the dump. ‘‘Other businesses asked me to pick theirs up, and so I slapped my name on the truck. One of my first contracts was the Quarter, and within a few years we were picking up over 14,000 homes in the city and state.’’

As he spoke, one of the N.O.P.D. officers in his employ — making $50 an hour, a premium rate for off-duty details — drove past in a Polaris. The force had been on the streets for two weeks, and while small in numbers, the sudden ubiquity of their flashing blue lights, combined with the privately funded presence of the State Police, provided something the Quarter had been lacking: the sense that the police were always nearby. ‘‘What I’m doing now isn’t all that different from the trash thing,’’ Torres said. ‘‘It’s about seeing a need — an unfortunate need — and stepping up to fill it.’’

Torres made it clear, though, that he did not view himself as merely a generous patron. ‘‘I’m already getting calls from other places, like Arkansas, that are interested in the app,’’ he said, citing as an inspiration Michael Bloomberg, New York’s billionaire former mayor, who popularized the notion that governmental institutions are most efficient when run like businesses. Torres involved himself in everything from hiring the officers to coordinating which routes they patrolled, and he became a regular presence at the French Quarter police station, arriving during the shift changes and hanging out in the anteroom that was dedicated to his dispatch.

Although the city presented the task force as a complement to the N.O.P.D., Torres seemed at times to take a more competitive view. Rather than work directly with the N.O.P.D., he deputized a fellow resident named Bob Simms, a retired rocket scientist who had been trying to corral businesses into funding private security measures, to help manage the enterprise. (Of his role, Simms said, ‘‘I’m Robin to Sidney’s Batman.’’) When The Times-Picayune reported that ‘‘regular N.O.P.D.’,’ rather than one of his men, was first on the scene after an armed robbery occurred during the force’s first night patrolling the Quarter, Torres insisted on a correction.

‘‘All these different agencies and egos, they’ve never had anything like this in terms of accountability,’’ Torres went on. ‘‘If someone doesn’t show up, I can see it on my phone: Why’s the truck still at the station?’’ Torres rewarded the officers who did a good job — like the one who broke up the potential gunfight a week earlier — with $100 gift certificates to Ruth’s Chris Steak House, something his partners in City Hall worried would foster a divisive atmosphere. ‘‘The government loves its rules, so many pointless rules that just slow everything down,’’ said Torres, who was raised in neighboring St. Bernard Parish, where his family ran the political machine for decades. ‘‘Look, it’s cool that the city supplied me with cops who can arrest people and use their guns. But I pay their salaries, I own the app and the vehicles. They’ve got two months to make this work, or I’ll take it away.’’

Torres also became involved in setting policy. Earlier that week, his force had coordinated with the N.O.P.D. in two huge arrest sweeps of so-called transients, whose familiar panhandling presence in the neighborhood (ragged clothes, mangy dogs, rusted harmonicas) had not been the subject of recent outrage. But Torres believed them to be a nuisance. ‘‘It’s the whole ‘broken windows’ theory,’’ he said. ‘‘You go after the little things in order to send a message that nothing will be tolerated.’’ He prioritized the sweeps during a meeting with Jeff Walls, the N.O.P.D. commander who oversees the Quarter. ‘‘Commander Walls told me they’ve wanted to do something about the gutter punks but didn’t know how,’’ Torres explained. ‘‘He made it sound so complicated — because they had dogs; they needed diabetes medicine. So I coordinated with the A.S.P.C.A. to figure out the dogs and got on the phone with the sheriff to get the medicine in the jails. Easy.’’

The targets of the arrests had not been connected to any serious crimes, and some of the city’s residents saw the move as questionable. ‘‘I’m not O.K. with a rich businessman paying cops to do his bidding, and ridding the Quarter of the bohemians and salt of the earth that make it such an interesting place to begin with,’’ offered a commenter on the Times-Picayune website. But after months of being fearful of walking home from work, Torres’s neighbors seemed to welcome his eagerness to take action of any sort. Strangers began to greet Torres in the streets, offering their vote should he decide to run for mayor in the future.

Toward the end of the meal, Torres was approached by a middle-aged couple who had arrived at the restaurant in the back of a pedicab, sipping wine from plastic cups. The man, tall and fit with a military buzz cut, turned out to be Col. Michael Edmonson, head of the Louisiana State Police; he and his wife joined Torres at the table. Edmonson, who had visited Torres at a resort he once owned in the Bahamas, praised Torres’s efforts. ‘‘A safer French Quarter means a healthier Louisiana,’’ he said, describing Torres, half-seriously, as being ‘‘almost like a police chief.’’ A week later, the colonel invited Torres to sit in on an undercover sting targeting human traffickers being conducted by the State Police in a French Quarter hotel.

The windows of Mitch Landrieu’s office, in City Hall, provide a panoramic view of a city that has had to contend with more adversity than any in America over the past decade: Katrina and subsequent hurricanes, the BP oil spill, the national recession and, these days, a citizenry fed up with the persistence of crime while the cost of living rises sharply. ‘‘We have a pretty good feeling that we’re moving in the right direction,’’ the mayor said on a rainy afternoon in mid-May, reflecting on the public-private security initiatives that had now been in place in the Quarter for six weeks. While the Quarter’s crime wave had not been entirely stanched — a young African-American man in the neighborhood was shot just a week earlier — there were significant improvements. Assaults and armed robberies were down as much as 30 percent; Torres’s force alone had confiscated 10 guns over two months, and it was the first on the scene during the recent shooting, assisting the State Police in the subsequent arrest of the suspected gunman. Some 9,800 people had downloaded the app, or more than twice the population of the neighborhood. ‘‘We know that it works,’’ Landrieu said of the task force. ‘‘Now it’s about looking for ways to scale it and fund it on a permanent basis.’’ Landrieu had recently proposed a small sales-tax hike in the Quarter, to be voted on in October, which would bring in funding to make the task force and State Police neighborhood fixtures.

When the mayor came into office, in 2010, he put a hiring freeze on the N.O.P.D. in order to balance the budget; that same year, in a move similar to one recently adopted in Baltimore, Landrieu invited the Justice Department to overhaul a force tainted by corruption, inept management and a history of civil rights violations. While the mayor acknowledged that these measures contributed to an understaffed and shrinking N.O.P.D., he went to great lengths to convey that they were intended to create a more efficient and transparent force in the long term — a difficult enough task without being harassed by a garbage tycoon who appointed himself a public safety advocate only after a flat-screen television was stolen from his home. Landrieu conceded, though, that Torres was the ‘‘impetus’’ that led to many of the current measures falling into place. ‘‘We have a way here of reaching out to the private sector in everything that’s happening in the city,’’ explained Landrieu, who has accepted on his city’s behalf more private grants than any mayor in the nation, including $4.2 million from Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2011. Noting similar arrangements in areas like the city’s sewage department and its recreation programs, he said, ‘‘It’s a new government model that’s emblematic of what the rest of the country should be doing.’’

Yet the mayor added that the successful efforts in one neighborhood had the potential to raise turbulence in others — namely, the poorer, blacker, less prominent precincts where crime is far more endemic. ‘‘The French Quarter is numerically the safest in the city,’’ said Landrieu, the city’s first white mayor since his father, Moon, vacated the office in 1978. ‘‘That doesn’t mean that what happens down there from time to time is not bad. But in the world that we live in, it creates a little bit of anxiety for the people who live out in Algiers and the Seventh Ward’’ — two far more violent neighborhoods — ‘‘where a number of murders are taking place between African-American men.’’

He paused for a moment, as if weighed down by the pressures of having to manage two vastly different cities that happen to occupy the same 170 square miles: the white, affluent one that has dominated the city’s resilient portrayal in the national media, and the other, more tenuous place, where 52 percent of African-American men are currently out of work and nearly 40 percent of all children are born into poverty.

‘‘And people are complaining about panhandlers in the Quarter?’’ the mayor continued. ‘‘You can see the juxtaposition that adds to unrest like you see in Baltimore.’’ Landrieu’s police chief, Michael Harrison, offered a similar sentiment in a conversation a few days earlier: ‘‘ ‘Hey, why didn’t you put the State Police in my neighborhood? How come there are no Polarises riding around my neighborhood?’ I’m getting asked these questions now every day.’’ Such tensions echoed those expressed last year by Ray Lewis, a retired captain of the Philadelphia Police Department. Lewis joined the protests in Ferguson, Mo., following the shooting death of Michael Brown to bring attention to what he believed was a dangerous precedent being set nationwide by the rise in public-private policing — one that was transforming law-enforcement protection into a privilege of the few rather than a basic right of all. ‘‘Corporate America is using police forces as their mercenaries,’’ Lewis declared.

Landrieu, for his part, acknowledged that allowing a private individual such significant participation in policing had not been without its growing pains. Torres’s hunger for credit, his disregard of regulations, his habit of leaking sensitive information that could make it harder to prosecute suspects — all this had resulted in more than a few heated arguments. ‘‘Sometimes, and I say this respectfully, but sometimes people get excited about their roles,’’ the mayor said. ‘‘I don’t want to diminish Sidney’s excitement, but I’m very clear in saying, ‘Listen, you don’t run the Police Department.’ ’’

By June, Torres’s vigilante enthusiasm was clearly waning. Though he had agreed to fund the force for a third month, he began spending time outside of New Orleans — traveling to New York, to his Miami condominium — and was overseeing a $5 million renovation on a new home he purchased across the street from his current residence. He now spoke with irritation about the reluctance of other businesses and wealthy individuals to contribute funding to the patrol. ‘‘People say, ‘Hey, I already pay taxes,’ ’’ Torres said. ‘‘Well, I pay taxes, too, but the fact is that people were still getting beat up for no reason, and I’ve built something that works. It’s time for someone else to step up.’’

Stephen Perry, president of the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau, which was paying for the State Police, ended up doing exactly that at the end of the month, putting together a plan to keep Torres’s force financed, at $900,000 a year, for at least the next five years. The package includes a larger sum earmarked to maintain around 45 State Police troopers for the same period, transforming the policing model for the French Quarter into one in which most city and state entities will be paid for by the private sector. ‘‘Frankly, it’s a gigantic paradigm shift in terms of how this city has approached public safety,’’ Perry said. A more diplomatic businessman than Torres, he described the new partnership as a means for allowing the N.O.P.D. to both rebuild slowly and deploy officers to more vulnerable neighborhoods immediately: a win-win situation for the entire city, and one he credited Torres with helping to realize. ‘‘The private sector rose up and took the bull by the horns,’’ Perry said.

A few days after Torres handed over control of the force, he took a walk through the Quarter. It was a sultry, humid night, but he walked quickly, buoyed by an undercurrent of vindication. A resident passing him in the street whispered, ‘‘Thank you,’’ and Torres thanked her back. ‘‘I don’t even know her,’’ he said once she had passed. He continued on to the neighborhood’s police station, where inside the room dedicated to his task force — no longer technically his, having been officially adopted into something resembling government policy — Torres ran into an officer named Patrick Guidry, who had just finished his shift.

‘‘How’s everything going?’’ Torres asked.

‘‘We hardly have any work these days,’’ said Guidry, the officer who had interrupted the potential gunfight during the force’s first week on the streets. ‘‘That block has been transformed,’’ Guidry added. ‘‘Sometimes the old players come out and test the waters, but they know we’re there and don’t hang around too long.’’

‘‘That’s awesome,’’ Torres said.

The boundary between order and chaos, however, remained precariously thin. A few weeks later, two blocks away from the one the officer had praised, a shootout broke out at 2 p.m. just outside the Quarter, in front of a shop that rents small electric cars to tourists. The shop’s owner counted between 12 and 20 shots fired. Five days later, a more violent incident occurred on the neighborhood’s periphery, in which a midday gunfight among multiple men left two with nonfatal gunshot wounds. Witnesses reported hearing at least 20 shots and seeing one man running down Canal Street, Downtown’s main commercial thoroughfare, carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. Another suspect crashed his car into a sedan, injuring its driver, a doctor at Tulane University.

‘‘Crazy, but that’s not the French Quarter,’’ Torres said the day after the shootings. ‘‘I’m just saying — ’’ He suddenly cut himself off, aware that his competitive drive at times fostered a myopic view of the larger challenges facing New Orleans. ‘‘What’s going on in this city right now,’’ he continued, ‘‘will take way more than just me to fix.’’",REAL
Can the Weeknd Turn Himself Into the Biggest Pop Star in the World?,"Tesfaye slowly began revealing himself in 2011 with a handful of live performances. By last year, he was a fringe superstar, selling out shows at huge venues like the Barclays Center, the Hollywood Bowl and the O2 Arena in London. Still, he began to feel that he had hit a ceiling — a high one, and maybe even a sustainable one, but a ceiling nonetheless.

The old Weeknd was comfortably, even enthusiastically, numb — the poet laureate of ruinous nights ending in bleary sunrises. His approach to songwriting, both in subject matter and production choices, was characterized by obscurity and darkness. But he began to wonder if there was another way. ‘‘I felt I had to change who I was,’’ he says. His new album, ‘‘Beauty Behind the Madness,’’ is the end result of a year’s worth of molting old habits, a creative upheaval that has begun to teleport him from the margins right to pop’s center.

By taking his old, gloomy gestures and repackaging them in ­ec­static, radio-­friendly arrangements, he has made one of the most sonically ambitious pop albums of the year, full of swaggeringly confident music indebted to the arena-­size ambition of the 1980s, from Guns N’ Roses to Phil Collins to Michael Jackson.

Above all, it is Jackson in Tesfaye’s cross hairs. ‘‘These kids, you know, they don’t have a Michael Jackson,’’ he says. ‘‘They don’t have a Prince. They don’t have a Whitney. Who else is there? Who else can really do it at this point?’’

Tesfaye was slumped in the back of his Mercedes S.U.V. one evening last December while being driven through Scarborough, a dreary suburban district of Toronto just a short ride from his luxury apartment downtown. The vehicle pulled into a parking lot behind a low-slung apartment complex, and he pointed at an upstairs window, to the flat he used to share with his mother and grandmother. ‘‘It’s a small apartment,’’ he said, ‘‘about the size of this car.’’

His parents emigrated from Ethiopia in the 1980s, when the country was reeling from civil war and drought, and came to Toronto. They never married, and after they split up, Tesfaye’s mother moved with him to this dull expanse northeast of the city center. His father wasn’t in the picture, and the two haven’t spoken since he was a boy. Tesfaye found the stillness in Scarborough to be, by turns, bucolic and sinister. ‘‘Like a Coen brothers movie,’’ he said, staring out the window.

Scarborough was stifling, and he constantly plotted ways to leave. He dropped out of high school when he was 17 and persuaded his best friend, La Mar Taylor, to join him. They met the first day of high school — Tesfaye noticed Taylor’s pink polo shirt — and the two quickly became partners in creative endeavors and, eventually, self-­destruction. One day they pulled up in a van at Tesfaye’s home. Tesfaye went to his room, grabbed his mattress, dragged it out of the house and threw it in. His mother watched him grimly. ‘‘The worst look anyone could ever have,’’ he recalls. ‘‘She looked at me like she had failed.’’

Tesfaye and Taylor and their friend Hyghly Alleyne moved into a one-­bedroom apartment in an old Victorian in Parkdale, an about-­to-­be-­gentrified neighborhood that was populated at the time, Taylor says, by ‘‘students and crackheads.’’ They paid the $850 monthly rent with money from welfare checks. They were still teenagers, and they lived like it. During the days, they would shoplift food at a nearby supermarket. Some nights they would walk to the Social, a neighborhood bar. Occasionally, they would get into fights. Most nights, they would get high on whatever was around — MDMA, Xanax, cocaine, mushrooms, ketamine. ‘‘ ‘Kids,’ without the AIDS,’’ Tesfaye said. ‘‘No rules.’’

Tesfaye sold a little weed, but for the most part he was broke. Eventually the three were evicted, so Tesfaye bed-­hopped. When he needed a place to stay, he would tell a girl he loved her. ‘‘There was, like, three girls that thought legit that I was their boyfriend,’’ he says. He found a square job, folding shirts in an American Apparel downtown. Around that time, he began writing and recording songs — at first for others, but when there were no takers, for himself.

When Tesfaye wasn’t high, he wasn’t happy, so he did his best to avoid coming down. And when he began writing songs, he found inspiration in that haze, penning lyrics about the dystopian, bacchanalian nights that he and his crew were having. He worked with a young musician, Jeremy Rose, on moody, sinister beats. The combined result was something like ‘‘American Psycho’’ with a soundtrack by Prince, sonically gauzy and verbally blunt, with Tesfaye cast as both villain and victim.

Taylor uploaded Tesfaye’s first three songs — ‘‘The Morning,’’ ‘‘What You Need’’ and ‘‘Loft Music’’ — to YouTube in the fall of 2010, posting the links to their friends’ Facebook walls and hoping for the best. The clips were audio only, accompanied by black-and-white photographs of not-quite-dressed women. Tesfaye’s likeness was nowhere to be found; you had to dig to find his name. He had wanted to call himself the Weekend, but there was already a rock band in Ontario called that, so he dropped a letter. His anonymity was so complete, he says, that his co-workers at American Apparel would listen to his music while he was working without realizing it was his.

At the end of that year, Oliver El-­Khatib, now the rapper Drake’s co-­manager, posted that first batch of Weeknd songs on the blog of Drake’s label, October’s Very Own, and Tesfaye instantly became the subject of international fascination. Soon after, he retreated to the studio to finish ‘‘House of Balloons,’’ the first of three planned mixtapes, which he released free online the following March. Meanwhile, Drake recruited Tesfaye to work on his 2011 album, ‘‘Take Care,’’ which included versions of three songs Tesfaye says he had initially written for ‘‘House of Balloons.’’ Over the next nine months, Tesfaye released the second and third free Weeknd mixtapes, ‘‘Thursday’’ and ‘‘Echoes of Silence.’’

A&R representatives and label heads had been flying to Toronto to woo him since those first songs were posted, and Tesfaye’s reluctance proved advantageous again. In May 2012, still unsigned, he played the Fonda Theater in Los Angeles. Monte Lipman, the chief executive of Republic Records, a division of Universal Music Group, took Rick Rubin for added ammunition. ‘‘I look to my left, it’s the Interscope crew, the Atlantic crew, the Columbia crew,’’ Lipman says. ‘‘It was like the Five Families all in one room.’’

Three months later, Tesfaye entered into a partnership with Republic, and for his first act he remastered the three mixtapes and sold them in a small box set called ‘‘Trilogy.’’ This collection of music — already available free online — went platinum.

At the time, R.&B. — the genre to which the Weeknd notionally belongs — had atrophied. Years of hybridization had left it a submissive sibling to hip-hop, a bland side dish. But as Tesfaye was emerging, so were similarly heretical soul singers like Frank Ocean and Miguel. They made R.&B. laden with references to indie rock and psychedelia for a younger generation accustomed to unexpected juxtapositions. The Internet had made novelty stars, and it had made mash-ups. But with this class of singers, it began to make auteurs.

Tesfaye’s music was a miasma of sensual, slithering rock and soul, cut with melancholic samples of Siouxsie & the Banshees and Cocteau Twins. He also imported hip-hop’s low rumble and vulgar mind-set, molding them to his sound. He moved at a crawl, his sound a dark vortex. In part, this left-field approach was strategic — he has a beautifully rogue voice far from the full-­bodied, gospel-­influenced traditional soul bellow. Instead, it suggests curdled anxiety, savage recrimination, the strain of pleasure and collapse. There are flashes of Michael Jackson, Smokey Robinson, even Robert Plant. Tesfaye attributes some of his signature vocal gestures to the Ethiopian influences of his childhood. (He still speaks Amharic, which he learned from his mother and grandmother.) The way he softly reaches for a high note, then falls back, then buzzes around it for a bit — that’s an inheritance from Aster Aweke, a veteran Ethiopian pop star.

This avant-­R.&B. was a hit with critics, but it didn’t always translate into commercial appeal. Tesfaye’s first major-­label album of original material, ‘‘Kiss Land,’’ came out in 2013. It was a Technicolor version of his mixtapes, full of long, fluid, semistructured, absorptive songs about desire and suspicion, but it sold only 268,000 copies, and none of the several singles the label pushed to radio took hold. His fervent fan base remained steady — when he toured, they filled arenas for him — but the Weeknd was a superstar act only inside his own universe.

Stymied, he turned to Wendy Goldstein, the head of urban A&R at Republic, for advice. ‘‘The underperforming of that record in his own expectations of what it was supposed to do shook him to his core,’’ she says. ‘‘I said, ‘You wanna be the biggest in the world?’ He said, ‘I absolutely wanna be the biggest in the world.’ ’’ She and the newly malleable Tesfaye got to work. First, she arranged for him to record the duet he would perform with Ariana Grande at the A.M.A.s, ‘‘Love Me Harder.’’

That track came from the studio of Max Martin, the Swedish producer whose influence on 2000s pop is matchless — his guiding hand firmly behind the careers of Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson and Katy Perry. He works with a large team of writers and producers out of a sprawling residential compound in West Hollywood that was once home to Frank Sinatra. Martin’s hit-­factory typically solicits little creative input from the talent, who show up when it’s time to sing. This process was alien to Tesfaye, who had always written his own lyrics and was unsure that he would be a good match for Grande’s good-girl gleam. When he saw the lyrics that were sent to him, he found them to be tepid. He rewrote his verse, recorded it and sent it back.

What could have been a contentious exchange was actually edifying for both parties: Martin liked Tesfaye’s changes and kept them; Tesfaye realized he could make sleek, accessible pop on his own terms. He asked Goldstein to secure Martin’s services for his next album. ‘‘If I’m gonna be the biggest in the world,’’ he told her, ‘‘I need a handful of songs like that.’’

When Tesfaye went to Martin’s complex last fall to begin work, he set up in a wing where Marilyn Monroe used to live. Martin’s team presented Tesfaye with a selection of prewritten material, and he rejected it all. They worked from scratch instead, and the first song they wrote was ‘‘In the Night,’’ the new album’s most electric moment, a homage to and an updating of peak-era Michael Jackson. Before going into the studio, Tesfaye was listening to ‘‘Copacabana,’’ the 1978 Barry Manilow disco jaunt about the showgirl Lola, the bartender Tony and the murder that took his life — and, in a sense, hers too. Its exuberant arrangement is a wide grin masking unspeakable pain.

‘‘In the Night’’ moves in similar horror-­story fashion. ‘‘She was numb, and she was so codependent,’’ he sings, pulling back from the notes with a splash of Jackson’s vocal agility. The music suggests celestial escape. Later, Tesfaye reveals the wound: ‘‘She was young, and she was forced to be a woman.’’ Underneath its sunbeam-­bright euphoria hides a tale of childhood sexual abuse. For Tesfaye, ‘‘In the Night’’ was the sort of compromise he was excited to make, a glistening surface salving the wounds that are his stock in trade. When he first played the song for Ron Perry, the president of Songs Music Publishing, which handles Tesfaye’s publishing, Perry couldn’t contain himself: ‘‘It’s ‘Billie Jean’! It’s ‘Billie [expletive] Jean’!’’

In his dressing room before concerts, Tesfaye plays Jackson’s ‘‘Off the Wall’’ for energy. Musically, though, Tesfaye’s fixation with Jackson has often been obscured by foggy production and his reluctance to conform to conventional song structure. On his early recordings, he says, his producers ‘‘would always try to structure it, make it more into a song, and I was always a punk: ‘I hate major chords. I hate structure. I want this song to be eight minutes long.’ It would kill them.’’ Jackson’s lessons seeped in, though. ‘‘My head-space now is, I love choruses,’’ Tesfaye says. ‘‘A chorus is not easy.’’

Jason Quenneville, who is known as DaHeala and is Tesfaye’s engineer and longtime musical collaborator, calls this album Tesfaye’s ‘‘O.K., fine, I’ll play ball’’ moment. ‘‘ ‘Kiss Land’ was, ‘O.K., let’s play baseball,’ but you’re swinging a plate of spaghetti,’’ he says. ‘‘Now it’s like, ‘Fine, I will apply myself, play ball with a ball and stick.’ ’’ Tesfaye has embraced pop’s soothing strictures. He speaks of songs in terms of major and minor keys, prehooks and hooks and bridges. ‘‘In that area, he’s even stronger than I thought,’’ says Jimmy Iovine, who tried to sign Tesfaye before leaving Interscope Records for Apple Music. ‘‘You would think he’d be breathing his own exhaust and shutting the world out, and he’s not doing that.’’

Instead, over the last six months, the Weeknd has become one of the most reliable hitmakers in pop. ‘‘Earned It,’’ a soothing ballad he wrote for the ‘‘50 Shades of Grey’’ soundtrack with, among others, Stephan Moccio, a songwriter who has worked with Celine Dion, went to No.3 on the Billboard Hot 100. By mid-July, Tesfaye had three songs in the Top 20 — ‘‘Earned It,’’ as well as the first two singles from the new album, ‘‘The Hills’’ and ‘‘Can’t Feel My Face.’’ Radio, so long hostile to his voice, had fully embraced him, yanking Tesfaye from the dark into the light.

But success means having fewer places to hide. One sticky night in early June, as Tesfaye left the Trump SoHo New York hotel, a couple of paparazzi lurked outside, braving spurts of rain. They asked him to stop for a picture — they certainly knew his name by now — but he didn’t, instead heading for one of four black S.U.V.s idling curbside, waiting to drive him and his crew uptown for a performance at the Museum of Modern Art. Moments later, the 18-year-old model Bella Hadid stepped out of the building, her black jacket draped over a sheer black top. She was asked to stop for one, too. She demurred, wordlessly ducking into one of the other trucks.

Tesfaye and Hadid have been the subject of tabloid attention and online speculation for most of the spring. There is at least one Instagram account dedicated to documenting every instance the two have shared space, be it physical or virtual. (If one of them liked the other’s Instagram photo, it’s captured here.) For an artist who thrived on emotional detachment, love poses a threat. ‘‘Probably my and my manager’s biggest fear is if this kid falls in love, we’re done, we’re finished,’’ Tesfaye had said in December.

Once the caravan arrived at MoMA, everyone spilled out of the S.U.V.s and surveyed the room. Hangers-on began clustering around Tesfaye, so he scurried to an elevator and the safety of his green room. Hadid gave him a quick kiss, then went with her friends to stand at the side of the stage.

A couple of weeks later, Tesfaye refused to talk about Hadid. Asked if he was in love, he replied: ‘‘I don’t know, to be honest with you. I don’t think so. Maybe. It’s no, it’s yes, it’s maybe.’’ He is telling a more complete story on the album: ‘‘It’s about me being who I am and stepping out of my comfort zone to try to feel something else besides what I’ve been feeling the past four years,’’ Tesfaye said last month in Los Angeles. ‘‘Ups and downs,’’ he said. ‘‘In my past albums, there were never ups.’’

The closest recent analogue to ‘‘Beauty Behind the Madness’’ is probably ‘‘1989,’’ Taylor Swift’s pop coming-­out party from last year, which also pulses with 1980s pomp, and which Martin had a heavy hand in, too. Like Tesfaye, Swift spent the early part of her career cultivating a finicky audience and then cut bait and re-­established herself at the very center. But Swift had, in essence, been making pop music all along, in terms of subject matter and structural approach. Tesfaye’s transformation is a more precarious balancing act, reframing his past without abandoning it, teaching his hard-core fans not to mind when the new ones show up to cheerily sing along. So far, it seems to be working; when Swift played at MetLife Stadium in July, she invited Tesfaye out to duet with him on ‘‘Can’t Feel My Face.’’

As he sees it, he is walking in the footsteps of artists of previous eras who, from an R.&B. foothold, rocketed into the stratosphere. So it didn’t come as a surprise when Tesfaye was visibly (and uncharacteristically) thrilled to relate the story of how he first met the legendary producer Quincy Jones. The two were at a club called Drai’s in Las Vegas, where Tesfaye performs frequently. The owner introduced him to Jones, 82 years old but still spry enough for the club. The two sat down next to each other. ‘‘He knew about me,’’ Tesfaye said, beaming. ‘‘You couldn’t wipe the smile off my face.’’

Tesfaye says that when he was working in the studio with Martin, he often thought of how Jones and Michael Jackson had pushed each other to greatness. Jones was there for the three seminal Jackson solo albums — ‘‘Off the Wall,’’ ‘‘Thriller’’ and ‘‘Bad’’ — and when Jones and Jackson first worked together, each was already well established. But in Jones’s hands, Jackson transcended race and style and spun pop gold out of the darkest subject matter.

Sitting next to Jones, Tesfaye said, he resisted the urge to badger him for old stories. Instead, he recalled, it was Jones who had a question for him: ‘‘What’s that one song, that more up-tempo song?’’ He was asking about ‘‘Can’t Feel My Face,’’ which Tesfaye had performed earlier in the night.

Should We Fear the Political ‘Crazies’?,"Black helicopters have become a proxy for dismissing as delusional anyone, usually on the right, who is hostile to any kind of government action. In 2013, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said that a suggestion that guns need to be registered ‘‘raises all the black-helicopter-crowd notion that what this is all about is identifying who has a gun so that one day the government can get up and go to the house and arrest everyone who has a gun.’’ For good measure, Biden tacked on that ‘‘they’ll cite Nazi Germany and all that.’’ And all that.

Where to begin with the ‘‘all thats’’? My favorite corner of the black-helicopter universe is the so-called ‘‘tin-foil-hat crowd,’’ a term that plays on historical paranoia about electromagnetic radiation and the dubious belief that metal headwear might offer some protection. Sometimes, there is an occasion in American politics to use the phrase almost literally: In May, after the former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee warned of ‘‘threats from an electromagnetic pulse from an exploded device that could fry the entire electrical grid and take the country back to the Stone Age,’’ you could hardly blame Salon for hailing him in a headline as ‘‘A President for the Tinfoil Hat Crowd.’’ (As a point of style, getting the term ‘‘crowd’’ into a put-down always lends an extra beat of dismissiveness.)

But the word is usually far more metaphorical and can be applied to each side. After a debate in 2012, liberal bloggers were accusing Mitt Romney of gaining an unfair advantage over Barack Obama by sneaking a cheat sheet onto his lectern. Romney supporters accused the other side of planting the story, and the Obama campaign wanted no part of this conspiracy. ‘‘We’ve never casted our lot with the tinfoil-hat crowd,’’ Ben Labolt, a spokesman for Obama, said.

Each party has always had passionate elements whom its leaders and candidates have decried as loony tunes. But as times change, so do notions of mainstream and loony tunes. Establishment candidates can wind up absorbing people into their coalitions that they might privately consider to be ‘‘crazies’’ or adapting their views to suit their campaigns. Hillary Rodham Clinton has run a far more liberal campaign to this point than she did in 2008, in part to tap into (or placate) an energized progressive base that helped sink her candidacy seven years ago. Could an actual socialist, Bernie Sanders, be a threat to her? How crazy would that be?

You could argue that these are crazy times and there are thus worse things to be called than a ‘‘crazy.’’ The affiliation suggests an admirable passion and less risk-aversion, a willingness to disrupt. In fact, many of the same Republicans that make up McCain’s ‘‘very extreme element’’ were part of the same movement — known as the Tea Party — that helped the G.O.P. win a congressional majority in 2010. They also might throw a primary scare into McCain when he seeks re-election in Arizona next year.

Trump is embracing it all. There is a thrilling quality to watching him. We tune in for the same reasons that pro-wrestling fans always watched Piper’s Pit. What will happen today? What will Rowdy Roddy say next? Crazy can make great box office. And as Trump is proving, there are clear benefits to being aligned with the crazies, especially in a Republican field so crowded that it can be difficult to get separation.

While party leaders have criticized Trump for his ‘‘tone,’’ he flouts this very criticism as emblematic of a political status quo. Not only is he correct about that, it’s arguable that the political status quo is itself a big bag of calcified crazy. The same ‘‘tone’’ — cautious and hyperdeferential — has dominated politics for a long time and yet our politics haven’t improved. Politicians are so fond of invoking that clichéd definition of insanity that has been variously attributed to Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Mark Twain: ‘‘doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.’’ And yet those same politicians keep coming back year after year, repeating the same old talking points and following the same unspoken rules.

Lindsey Graham recently referred to Trump as a ‘‘wrecking ball,’’ a term he borrowed, if not from Miley Cyrus, then from his friend McCain, who once derided John Kerry with the same metaphor in criticizing Kerry’s diplomatic forays as secretary of state. McCain was once viewed as a kind of wrecking ball, too, back in 2000, when he first ran for president and was driving his party establishment nuts. He nearly knocked off the overwhelming front-runner, George W. Bush. He spearheaded a bill, McCain-Feingold, in 2002, that overhauled the nation’s campaign-finance system (at least until the Supreme Court took a wrecking ball to that). His tone was blunt, he appeared to be making it up as he went along and he took contrarian positions. He was derided as dangerous and disruptive, even crazy, though he preferred a different term: ‘‘maverick.’’",REAL
Why Greece’s Lenders Need to Suffer,"On that day in 2009 when GR0133004177 was issued, investors had every reason to assume that this was an especially risky loan. The Greek government wanted 7 billion euros, or $10.5 billion, which would not be paid back in full until 2026. These were all sophisticated investors, who were expected to think very carefully about the number they typed, because that number had to reflect their belief in the Greek government’s ability to continually pay its debts for the next 17 years. I was shocked, looking back, to see the winning number: 5.3 percent. That is a very low interest rate, only a couple of percentage points above the rate at which Germany, Europe’s most creditworthy nation, was borrowing money. This was a rate that expressed a near certainty that Greece would never miss a payment.

Photo

In hindsight, of course, we know that the investors should not have lent Greece anything at all, or, if they did, should have demanded something like 100 percent interest. But this is not a case of retrospective genius. At the time, investors had all the information they needed to make a smarter decision. Greece, then as now, was a small, poor, largely agrarian economy, with a spotty track record for adhering to globally recognized financial controls. Just three weeks earlier, a newly elected Greek prime minister revealed that the previous government had scrupulously hidden billions of dollars in debt from the rest of the world. In fact, the new leader revealed, Greece owed considerably more money than the size of its entire annual economy. Within a month of the bond sale, faced with essentially the same information the investors had, Moody’s and the other ratings agencies downgraded the country’s credit rating. In less than six months, Greece was negotiating a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.

The original sin of the Greek crisis did not happen in Athens. It happened on those computer terminals, in Frankfurt and London and Shanghai and New York. Yes, the Greeks took the money. But if I offered you €7 billion at 5.3 percent interest, you would probably take the money, too. I would be the one who looked nuts. And if I didn’t even own that money — if I was just watching over it for someone else, as most large investors do — I might even go to jail.

Today, the global bond market is twice the size of the stock market. And while bonds barely move in price compared with stocks, bonds’ slight twitches give far more important information. A slight increase in a bond’s interest rate can serve as a warning that investors no longer trust a company or a government quite so much; a drop in rates can be a reward for hard work accomplished, allowing an institution to raise future funds at a lower long-term cost. But a world of bonds works only when the investors who buy the bonds are extremely nervous and wildly cautious. Bonds, that is, are designed to be safe and boring investments, bought by extremely conservative institutions, like pension funds, insurance companies and central banks. When they are bought by (or on behalf of) private investors, they are supposed to represent the more stable portion of the overall mix. The very nature of stock markets inclines them to collapse every decade or so, and when they do, it can be painful. But a stock-market collapse is not debilitating. If the world bond market were to collapse, our way of life would be over.

On Sept. 17, 2008, in the late afternoon, this almost happened. For a few dramatic days, prominent economists and other financial experts — serious, unemotional people who had never before said anything shocking in their lives — talked privately, if not publicly, about the real possibility of the end of the United States, the end of electricity and industry and democracy. When the bailout money flowed to save the banks, that was just the fastest way to accomplish the real goal: to save the bond market.

And in that moment, the essential nature of the bond market shifted. Previously, the stability of bonds was reinforced by the cautiousness of people who owned and managed them, and vice versa. But the bailout broke this virtuous circle, signaling that the bond market would stay safe even when bond buyers were wildly reckless, pouring billions of dollars, for example, into risky subprime-mortgage bonds. The bailout represented a transfer of wealth from the rest of the economy into the bond market — precisely the opposite of what is supposed to happen. Now, in the moral hand-wringing over Greece and its failure to pay, we see that bondholders expect to be bailed out constantly, even when they were obviously culpable in failing to manage their own risk. The various European Union plans for Greece involve what is essentially a transfer of wealth from poor Greek people to wealthy German bondholding institutions.

The institutions that bought that €7 billion in Greek debt in 2009 made a very bad judgment. Even at the time, it was clearly a foolish gamble — so foolish, in fact, that it can be explained in only one way. They believed that in the event of default, the Germans would bail the Greeks out. And just to be clear: This doesn’t mean they believed that the Germans would be kind to the Greeks. It means they believed that the Germans would be kind to the people who owned Greek bonds, a significant percentage of whom were certain to be German themselves. In lending money to Greece at 5.3 percent interest, they weren’t calculating Greece’s ability to pay. They were calculating the German government’s willingness to help out German banks.

To be fair, the people who owned GR0133004177 did see its value fall by nearly half in 2012, when the Greek government negotiated its second bailout package with the European Union and the I.M.F. But by most estimates, those bondholders should have lost far more, even the full amount of their investment. Instead, the bailout effectively transferred billions of euros from Greek citizens to unwise bond investors.

There is an unsentimental logic to markets. If you make a bad investment, you are supposed to pay the full price — because if you don’t pay the full price, you will keep making bad investments. The only way to get the bond market back to its historic role is to make bondholders feel real fear that they might lose money if they make bad decisions. We need the market to reward bets that are economically wise, instead of those that are politically savvy.",REAL
What Can I Do About a Neighbor’s Partying Child?,"Photo

I live in a neighborhood of predominately single-family homes in Southern California. On our block, most homes have garages that lead to an alleyway shared by homes on the other side. One neighbor is a single parent with three children, one of them a junior in high school. When they first moved in last summer, this adolescent was using the converted garage as an area for social gatherings. Multiple teenagers parked their cars in the alley, which is expressly forbidden by posted signs, and engaged in underage drinking. The mother was approached and essentially told us that we should talk to her child because she has been ineffective. This summer, although the cars are no longer in the alleyway, the partying has resumed: Our trash can was filled with beer cans this morning so that the parent would not be aware. I think this is an accident waiting to happen. The police have taken reports, but the behavior is unchanged. What would you do? I was so angry this morning, I wanted to dump the evidence on her front porch. NAME WITHHELD

Kenji Yoshino: The writer is caught, as we all are, in a time of shifting norms. Some decades ago, the norm was more ‘‘it takes a village’’ — a neighbor could discipline another neighbor’s child directly. Now we’re all supposed to say we can’t discipline anyone else’s child. But ‘‘it takes a village’’ should be the model here. First, the parent has effectively enlisted your help. Second, the problem is such that no individual can really address it alone. For me, the most noble and elevated goal here is to prevent drinking and driving. I would really encourage the letter writer to enlist the help of other neighbors and go as a cadre or a group of parents to the single-parent home and to offer assistance.

Amy Bloom: It’s nice to offer the assistance. But this is a case in which the mother has said, ‘‘I’m not getting anywhere with this kid, feel free to talk to the kid,’’ which is not the same as saying, ‘‘I’d really like your help in managing this situation.’’

There’s the elevated concern, which is drinking and driving. Then there are legal concerns — these kids are underage, and they’re parking where they shouldn’t. The letter writer is entitled to be really annoyed by this and to ask the cops if they could do a slow roll late at night to clear out the partyers. I would ask the mother to meet with you and a couple of the neighbors and also ask the kid to join you as well. You have to tell the kid that you’re not going to tolerate this behavior; that regardless of whether his or her mother is resigned to being ineffective, the neighbors are not; and that the police will be called regularly about the partying and the mess and the underage drinking.",REAL
The Miracle of Preserves,"Photo

For as long as I can remember, I have had an unfathomably strong affection for pickles and potted meats and jellies and jams. I was thrown into the preserving pond early. I sat as a toddler, I am told, several summers running, in the cool shade of a tidy old trailer in Canaan, Me., playing with snails as the mobile home’s fleshy mistress, Louise, taught my mother to select cucumbers and beets and pole beans from a dense trailer-­side garden — packing them into heavy glass jars and then gently heating them in a worn tin pot.

I don’t think I ever tasted any of Louise’s many preserves. (‘‘Oh, they were terrible!’’ my mother tells me. ‘‘Horribly sweet.’’) The omission might help account for my obdurately romantic view of what the British writer Hugh Fearnley-­Whittingstall refers to as the ‘‘extended family we call by the rather austere name preserves.’’ All preserves strike me as good. They reach me at such childish, religious depths that I have wondered if, even before Louise’s trailer and my rapturous secondhand consumption of jarred delicacies in books, some supernatural pickle pot or jelly didn’t offer me a miraculous taste of itself in a dream.

I have felt lucky, as a grown person, to discover that this thing I loved in innocent abstraction had real importance. Salting and drying meat and fish helped human beings to last through long winters, sea voyages and treacherous overland trails. If cultivating soil was what let us settle, it was harnessing bacterial cultures and sugar, salt, acid, fat, sun and wind to paralyze microorganisms and save food from decay that let us unmoor, discovering all the world that was not visible from our cabbage patches. Basque cider allowed seamen to cross oceans. Dutch pickled herring fueled the exploration of the New World. Vikings spread cod in the riggings of their ships to dry and stiffen in the cold wind, then traded on it as they battled through Scandinavia, the Mediterranean and Central Asia. Cheese was first a way of preserving milk; wine, of grape juice; sauerkraut, of cabbage; prosciutto, of pork. In this sense, all preserved things are additionally miraculous, in that they all are also ways of storing other things: part vessel, part content.

Superior instructions for preserving staples abound, inventions of every population at every moment in time. The laws of the physical world haven’t changed since Egyptian fishermen dried their catches in the sun around 12,000 B.C.; even ancient formulas for drying and pickling and potting, invulnerable as the tides, work today.

Recipes for preserving the usual suspects — ripe tomatoes, beans, corn, strawberries — are so many and so intuitive that my own practical interest has alighted elsewhere, on strange preserves. Here are a few that have jumped out at me over the years, for possessing just the sort of otherworldly magic I first noticed as a child.

Grapefruit marmalade is a profoundly satisfying thing to make, whether your interest is poetical or practical. I can’t provide a perfect recipe, because mine is always a farrago. If you do more or less this, though — Remove the peel from four grapefruits with a knife. Slice three thinly. Segment the fruit itself from its membrane into a bowl, with all attendant juices. Boil the sliced peel with 2 cups of water for 20 minutes. Add grapefruit, juice and three cups of sugar, and boil until it lightly jells — the result is bitterer than orange marmalade, a perfect expression of grapefruit’s oddities and opposites.",REAL

Exit Strategy,"The next kachakbar was an elected official, believe it or not. When we went to see him at his office near Ghazi Stadium, he had bodyguards protecting him. He said he could take us to England for $18,000. He took our passports, and then told us we owed a thousand dollars each. We said we didn’t have the money, at which point he threatened to kill us. But I never heard from him again and never got my passport back. (I had to pay about $100 and wait many weeks to get a new one.)

The kachakbar after that told us that he would send us to Brazil; from there, he said, we could get into Canada or the U.S. And so I gave him my passport. But that night I found out that it’s just as difficult to get into Canada from Brazil as it is from Afghanistan. Next morning, I called the kachakbar and I asked for my passport back. He said no, so I had to replace it for the second time.

It was all pretty frustrating. It had taken me a couple of years to get nowhere. Last December, I decided to apply for a special immigrant visa to the U.S. for Afghans who worked on behalf the American government. I collected all the documents, and sent it off. But it still hasn’t come through. And meanwhile there is no life for me here. There is no freedom, no security, no future, no economy, no jobs. So last month my friend and I met yet another smuggler in a restaurant.

He kept saying, ‘‘I am not a kachakbar, I am a good man.’’ I said, ‘‘Hey, man, you don’t want to call yourself a kachakbar, that’s fine by me.’’ He said he helped people make their dreams come true. I said, ‘‘Sure, whatever.’’ But he seems to know what he is doing. We’d fly to Tehran, where someone would greet us and take us across the border to Turkey. From Turkey, we’d go to Bulgaria, and then on from there. He asked for $10,000 each, which I can’t afford, but my friends and family said they would help me.

But a couple of weeks ago, I talked­ to some people who finally got their special visas, and they advised me to wait at least another month. If I go with the kachakbar, I will be an illegal immigrant in Europe. If I get the visa, I can enter the U.S. on a completely legal basis. So I am back to waiting.

Yesterday was like the day before, which was like the day before that. The first thing I did was check my email from my laptop in bed for word on the visa. The second thing I did was go back to sleep; because I am jobless, there is nothing to do. I had breakfast at home with my mom, dad and sister. We don’t talk when we eat, but I know that they hope I will be able to go.

After that, I went to see my friend where he works as a guard. He is planning to leave soon, and he is angry that I am not going, but what can I do? ‘‘I really need you to come with me,’’ he started saying. ‘‘Come with me please. I will be alone. I don’t want to leave by myself.’’ He told me not to worry about the money, that he would pay for it.

Letter of Recommendation: Egg Shakers,"Photo

We give babies rattles because babies understand abandon, because they’re not too proud or complicated yet to shake those rattles hard and feel free. I’m no baby; I’m a man, with two small children of my own. But last fall, I got an egg shaker, and I’ve enjoyed putting on records and playing egg shaker along with them ever since. It’s an outlet, a release — like air guitar, but with one key difference. I am making noise.

You’ve seen egg shakers before. They’re small, hand-held percussion instruments: ovules of hard plastic or wood filled with mysterious pellets (‘‘nontoxic steel shot,’’ says the manufacturer of mine) that clatter around inside. As a designed object, I think, the egg shaker is underappreciated. In your hand, it has the sleek, inevitable feel of an Apple product; it’s like an analog, Paleolithic iPod with unlimited music inside.

There don’t appear to be any obvious, landmark egg-shaker performances in the annals of rock ’n’ roll — nothing like that ‘‘Sunshine of Your Love’’ riff, which all teenage guitarists learn, or even ‘‘(Don’t Fear) The Reaper,’’ which I imagine is the go-to track for beginning cowbellers. One drummer I asked could not think of a single record with a standout egg-shaker performance, even after several days of mulling it over; all that came to mind, he confessed, was some locally famous figure in the Eugene, Ore., music scene during the ’90s, who would turn up at shows with glitter all over his face, playing an egg shaker loudly in the crowd. Others mentioned Santana’s ‘‘Oye Como Va.’’ Surely there’s an egg shaker in there, they said. But it’s hard to pick out from all the other percussion, like a handful of sand blowing around a beach. Another musician pointed me to Steely Dan’s ‘‘Do It Again,’’ but it turned out to be a pair of maracas, which I consider less refined: two ungainly red tubes of Oscar Mayer, compared with the egg shaker’s fine charcuterie.

My favorite album to play egg shaker to is the Band’s ‘‘Live at the Academy of Music, 1971.’’ It’s this particular style of underproduced, raggedy rock that seems to work best: music that feels as if it may tear away from the metronome at any minute — thus leaving me a nice, fat space in the rhythm to slide in with my egg shaker and really make a difference. That’s the whole joy of playing egg shaker, after all: being able to turn my head and imagine I’m onstage, giving one of those stink-faced, digging-it nods to the drummer. It’s a modest rock-star fantasy — not about glory, but about connectedness; the feeling of making a small but constant contribution to the machinery of a larger whole.

This hit home when, recently, I tried playing egg shaker to the latest Taylor Swift album. It was very unsatisfying. The tracks were all so perfectly textured and tightly fused together; all I could do was play on top of the music, instead of inside it. On the other hand, get a load of the Band, with their fury of twang and jangle and notes splattering out of a Wurlitzer like tracers of lard from a hot pan — all that noise careening precariously around the downbeat, like a pub full of drunks slurring half-remembered lines of iambic pentameter. Plenty of room for me and my egg shaker — not a chance to pilot the plane through that turbulence, or even co-pilot it, but just to be one whirring turbine blade in an engine somewhere on the wing.

The egg shaker

belongs to a subset of musical instruments known as idiophones, which produce sound using hard resonant materials. There are several subtypes: concussion idiophones (e.g., cymbals), friction idiophones (e.g., musical saw), percussion idiophones (e.g., triangle), plucked idiophones (e.g., jaw harp) and of course, shaken idiophones (e.g., egg shakers).

‘‘Live at the Academy of Music, 1971’’ is full of good egg-shaker opportunities: ‘‘The Shape I’m In,’’ ‘‘This Wheel’s on Fire,’’ ‘‘Stage Fright.’’ In fact, it was while playing egg shaker to ‘‘Stage Fright’’ in my kitchen one night last winter that something really clicked for me. It was the kind of ordinary evening that, in five or 10 years, when my kids are older and have less time for me, I expect to look back on warmly but that, at the time, was tinged with a kind of low-grade loneliness. As I remember it, my wife was working late and I’d just given my daughters their dinner. They were happily eating it, sort of, and I was standing by the stove, playing a little egg shaker.

I reached another level with the egg shaker that night — not in my technical proficiency but in terms of the intensity of my connection with the instrument. It was during the last half of the song, when everyone in the Band is playing as hard as they can, seemingly at the feverish edge of their abilities. All that sound was tumbling down on me, and my little egg shaker like a collapsing building, except, floating above it, the wholesome, perfectly enunciated and occasionally close-to-breaking voice of the bassist, Rick Danko — an Ontario farm boy turned rock star, I later read, who was only allowed to sing lead occasionally and wasn’t exactly up to the task (‘‘a nervous, tremulous voice’’ was how one critic described it). And here’s what he was singing: ‘‘See the man with the stage fright/Just standing up there to give it all his might/And he got caught in the spotlight/But when we get to the end/He wants to start all over again.’’",REAL
‘Air Mail’,"(Translated by Patty Crane from Swedish)



On a hunt for a mailbox

I carried the letter through town.

In the great forest of stone and concrete

this lost butterfly fluttered.



The stamp’s flying carpet

the address’s reeling letters

plus my sealed-in truth

now winging over the ocean.



The Atlantic’s crawling silver.

The cloudbanks. The fishing boat

like a spat-out olive pit.

And the wakes’ pale scars.



Down here work goes slowly.

I often sneak peeks at the clock.

The tree-shadows are black figures

in the greedy silence.



The truth is there on the ground

but no one dares to take it.

The truth is out on the street.

No one makes it their own.",REAL
How to Cure a Cat’s Anxiety,"Photo

Impulse-control problems, phobias, anxiety, violent outbursts and compulsive disorders are not uncommon in pets. ‘‘Unfortunately, you cannot put a cat on a couch and say, ‘Tell me about your mother,’ ” says E’Lise Christensen, a veterinary behaviorist with practices in Manhattan and Denver. (‘‘Think of us as animal psychiatrists,’’ she says.) Still, you can treat the kind of underlying feline psychological distress that leads to biting, scratching, moping and urinating outside the litter box. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Prozac can help, but Christensen advises clients to examine a pet’s environment before turning to pharmacology. ‘‘Ask yourself, Are you coming close to meeting this animal’s natural needs? The answer is almost always no.’’

To treat a mentally unstable cat, start by making its indoor environment richer and more reminiscent of the outdoors. Install a fish tank; hang a bird feeder outside a window; get a small, preylike robotic toy (Christensen suggests Hexbugs); make a lofted perch; introduce novelties like an empty paper bag or a wand toy. Cats are predators, preferring to hunt 10 to 20 cricket-to-mouse-size meals a day. Even in a studio apartment, you can help satisfy that instinct by switching the food bowl for a so-called puzzle feeder, a ball or tube-shaped toy that dispenses bits of kibble when batted about.

Sometimes the root of the problem is you: Overpetting can induce aggression in cats. So cool it with the groping. Don’t presume your cat is anything like a dog. ‘‘That’s like expecting a giraffe to behave like a deer,’’ says Christensen, whose practice tends to focus on severe cases (some of the most common emergency calls come from people locked inside their bathrooms hiding from combative cats).

Cats are enigmatic creatures. Just because Shadow urinated on your favorite cashmere sweater or defecated in your slippers while you were on vacation, don’t assume she’s vindictive or angry. Beware of anthropomorphizing pets, especially cats, Christensen says. ‘‘It is dangerous to ascribe human emotions to an animal that break down your bond with that animal.’’",REAL
The 7.19.15 Issue,"Leibovich argues that the drip-drip release of emails from Clinton’s time as secretary of state has inadvert­ently helped the campaign achieve that dream goal of every candidate: presenting the real Hillary Clinton. ... What’s really being said, of course, is usually that the candidates are too candidate-y — that they seem as if they’re trying to leverage their communications sophistication to hide who they really are. ... Sure, they’re all nice and easygoing sometimes, but who isn’t? Sometimes, like when they’re campaigning, they aren’t.

Or, look at it another way: Is the you that you offer on Facebook ‘‘the real you’’? Of course not. The ‘‘real’’ us is never really knowable by another person. What candidates who want you to know the ‘‘real’’ them are really saying is, ‘‘I know you don’t like me, but trust me that you would.’’ Philip Bump, in a post on The Fix, a blog by The Washington Post

I’m going through re-entry with my boyfriend right now and losing all hope. He is a 39-year-old black man just released from prison. We are having such a hard time getting him acclimated. I’m going to read him your story and pray it gives him some hope. Like one man mentioned in your piece, he is also having a hard time obtaining his birth certificate — something that should be so easy, but it’s so out of reach.

My boyfriend served five years in New York for a felony and, as he was an illegal immigrant, was released at the border with no money, except for what his family had deposited into an account for him. He made his way back to his hometown in Mexico and tried to put his life back together. This article helped me understand him a little more and the struggles he encountered.

I greatly appreciate your giving the story of released prisoners a heart and soul that is not normally portrayed in the media and our culture in the United States. Yes, these men and women may have committed crimes, but they have served their time. And in many cases, more than a reasonable amount of time was served. However, it seems that as a society, we continue to punish them by ostracizing them. I hope that through articles like yours, we can collectively change our minds and our treatment of these men and women. Name Withheld

In a nation that purports to be the land of the free, how the draconian three-strikes law could be so casually implemented without considering that a man arrested for shoplifting white socks could be doomed to spend the rest of his life locked up is stupefying.

Is This the End of Christianity in the Middle East?,"Piling 10 family members into a Toyota pickup, Rana’s brothers ran, too. From the road, they called Diyaa repeatedly, pleading with him to escape with Rana. ‘‘She can’t go,’’ Diyaa told one of Rana’s brothers, as the brother later recounted to me. ‘‘ISIS isn’t coming. This is all a lie.’’

The next morning Diyaa and Rana woke to a nearly empty town. Only 100 or so people remained in Qaraqosh, mostly those too poor, old or ill to travel. A few, like Diyaa, hadn’t taken the threat seriously. One man passed out drunk in his backyard and woke the next morning to ISIS taking the town.

As Diyaa and Rana hid in their basement, ISIS broke into stores and looted them. Over the next two weeks, militants rooted out most of the residents cowering in their homes, searching house to house. The armed men roamed Qaraqosh on foot and in pickups. They marked the walls of farms and businesses ‘‘Property of the Islamic State.’’ ISIS now held not just Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, but also Ramadi and Fallujah. (During the Iraq War, the fighting in these three places accounted for 30 percent of U.S. casualties.) In Qaraqosh, as in Mosul, ISIS offered residents a choice: They could either convert or pay the jizya, the head tax levied against all ‘‘People of the Book’’: Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews. If they refused, they would be killed, raped or enslaved, their wealth taken as spoils of war.

No one came for Diyaa and Rana. ISIS hadn’t bothered to search inside their ramshackle house. Then, on the evening of Aug. 21, word spread that ISIS was willing to offer what they call ‘‘exile and hardship’’ to the last people in Qaraqosh. They would be cast out of their homes with nothing, but at least they would survive. A kindly local mullah was going door to door with the good news. Hoping to save Diyaa and Rana, their neighbors told him where they were hiding.

Diyaa and Rana readied themselves to leave. The last residents of Qaraqosh were to report the next morning to the local medical center, to receive ‘‘checkups’’ before being deported from the Islamic State. Everyone knew the checkups were really body searches to prevent residents from taking valuables out of Qaraqosh. Before ISIS let residents go — if they let them go — it was very likely they would steal everything they had, as residents heard they had done elsewhere.

Diyaa and Rana called their families to let them know what was happening. ‘‘Take nothing with you,’’ her brothers told Diyaa. But Diyaa, as usual, didn’t listen. He stuffed Rana’s clothes with money, gold, passports and their identity papers. Although she was terrified of being caught — she could be beheaded for taking goods from the Islamic State — Rana didn’t protest; she didn’t dare. According to her brothers, Diyaa could be violent. (Diyaa’s brother Nimrod disputed this, just as he does Diyaa’s alleged cheapness.)

At 7 the next morning, Diyaa and Rana made the five-minute walk from their home to Qaraqosh Medical Center Branch No. 2, a yellow building with red-and-green trim next to the city’s only mosque. As the crowd gathered, Diyaa phoned both his family and hers. ‘‘We’re standing in front of the medical center right now,’’ he said, as his brother-in-law recalled it. ‘‘There are buses and cars here. Thank God, they’re going to let us go.’’

It was a searing day. Temperatures reach as high as 110 degrees on the Nineveh Plain in summer. By 9 a.m., ISIS had separated men from women. Seated in the crowd, the local ISIS emir, Saeed Abbas, surveyed the female prisoners. His eyes lit on Aida Hana Noah, 43, who was holding her 3-year-old daughter, Christina. Noah said she felt his gaze and gripped Christina closer. For two weeks, she’d been at home with her daughter and her husband, Khadr Azzou Abada, 65. He was blind, and Aida decided that the journey north would be too hard for him. So she sent her 25-year-old son with her three other children, who ranged in age from 10 to 13, to safety. She thought Christina too young to be without her mother.

ISIS scanned the separate groups of men and women. ‘‘You’’ and ‘‘you,’’ they pointed. Some of the captives realized what ISIS was doing, survivors told me later, dividing the young and healthy from the older and weak. One, Talal Abdul Ghani, placed a final call to his family before the fighters confiscated his phone. He had been publicly whipped for refusing to convert to Islam, as his sisters, who fled from other towns, later recounted. ‘‘Let me talk to everybody,’’ he wept. ‘‘I don’t think they’re letting me go.’’ It was the last time they heard from him.

No one was sure where either bus was going. As the jihadists directed the weaker and older to the first of two buses, one 49-year-old woman, Sahar, protested that she’d been separated from her husband, Adel. Although he was 61, he was healthy and strong and had been held back. One fighter reassured her, saying, ‘‘These others will follow.’’ Sahar, Aida and her blind husband, Khadr, boarded the first bus. The driver, a man they didn’t know, walked down the aisle. Without a word, he took Christina from her mother’s arms. ‘‘Please, in the name of God, give her back,’’ Aida pleaded. The driver carried Christina into the medical center. Then he returned without the child. As the people in the bus prayed to leave town, Aida kept begging for Christina. Finally, the driver went inside again. He came back empty-handed.

Aida has told this story before with slight variations. As she, her husband and another witness recounted it to me, she was pleading for her daughter when the emir himself appeared, flanked by two fighters. He was holding Christina against his chest. Aida fought her way off the bus.

‘‘Please give me my daughter,’’ she said.

The emir cocked his head at his bodyguards.

‘‘Get on the bus before we kill you,’’ one said.

Christina reached for her mother.

‘‘Get on the bus before we slaughter your family,’’ he repeated.

Slide Show

As the bus rumbled north out of town, Aida sat crumpled in a seat next to her husband. Many of the 40-odd people on it began to weep. ‘‘We cried for Christina and ourselves,’’ Sahar said. The bus took a sharp right toward the Khazir River that marked an edge of the land ISIS had seized. Several minutes later, the driver stopped and ordered everyone off.

Led by a shepherd who had traveled this path with his flock, the sick and elderly descended and began to walk to the Khazir River. The journey took 12 hours.

The second bus — the one filled with the young and healthy — headed north, too. But instead of turning east, it turned west, toward Mosul. Among its captives was Diyaa. Rana wasn’t with him. She had been bundled into a third vehicle, a new four-wheel drive, along with an 18-year-old girl named Rita, who’d come to Qaraqosh to help her elderly father flee.

The women were driven to Mosul, where, the next day, Rana’s captor called her brothers. ‘‘If you come near her, I’ll blow the house up. I’m wearing a suicide vest,’’ he said. Then he passed the phone to Rana, who whispered, in Syriac, the story of what happened to her. Her brothers were afraid to ask any questions lest her answers make trouble for her. She said, ‘‘I’m taking care of a 3-year-old named Christina.’’

Most of Iraq’s Christians call themselves Assyrians, Chaldeans or Syriac, different names for a common ethnicity rooted in the Mesopotamian kingdoms that flourished between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers thousands of years before Jesus. Christianity arrived during the first century, according to Eusebius, an early church historian who claimed to have translated letters between Jesus and a Mesopotamian king. Tradition holds that Thomas, one of the Twelve Apostles, sent Thaddeus, an early Jewish convert, to Mesopotamia to preach the Gospel.

As Christianity grew, it coexisted alongside older traditions — Judaism, Zoroastrianism and the monotheism of the Druze, Yazidis and Mandeans, among others — all of which survive in the region, though in vastly diminished form. From Greece to Egypt, this was the eastern half of Christendom, a fractious community divided by doctrinal differences that persist today: various Catholic churches (those who look to Rome for guidance, and those who don’t); the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox (those who believe Jesus has two natures, human and divine, and those who believe he was solely divine); and the Assyrian Church of the East, which is neither Catholic nor Orthodox.

When the first Islamic armies arrived from the Arabian Peninsula during the seventh century, the Assyrian Church of the East was sending missionaries to China, India and Mongolia. The shift from Christianity to Islam happened gradually. Much as the worship of Eastern cults largely gave way to Christianity, Christianity gave way to Islam. Under Islamic rule, Eastern Christians lived as protected people, dhimmi: They were subservient and had to pay the jizya, but were often allowed to observe practices forbidden by Islam, including eating pork and drinking alcohol. Muslim rulers tended to be more tolerant of minorities than their Christian counterparts, and for 1,500 years, different religions thrived side by side.

One hundred years ago, the fall of the Ottoman Empire and World War I ushered in the greatest period of violence against Christians in the region. The genocide waged by the Young Turks in the name of nationalism, not religion, left at least two million Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks dead. Nearly all were Christian. Among those who survived, many of the better educated left for the West. Others settled in Iraq and Syria, where they were protected by the military dictators who courted these often economically powerful minorities.

From 1910 to 2010, the percentage of the Middle Eastern population that was Christian — in countries like Egypt, Israel, Palestine and Jordan — continued to decline; once 14 percent of the population, Christians now make up roughly 4 percent. (In Iran and Turkey, they’re all but gone.) In Lebanon, the only country in the region where Christians hold significant political power, their numbers have shrunk over the past century, to 34 percent from 78 percent of the population. Low birthrates have contributed to this decline, as well as hostile political environments and economic crisis. Fear is also a driver. The rise of extremist groups, as well as the perception that their communities are vanishing, causes people to leave.

For more than a decade, extremists have targeted Christians and other minorities, who often serve as stand-ins for the West. This was especially true in Iraq after the U.S. invasion, which caused hundreds of thousands to flee. ‘‘Since 2003, we’ve lost priests, bishops and more than 60 churches were bombed,’’ Bashar Warda, the Chaldean Catholic archbishop of Erbil, said. With the fall of Saddam Hussein, Christians began to leave Iraq in large numbers, and the population shrank to less than 500,000 today from as many as 1.5 million in 2003.

The Arab Spring only made things worse. As dictators like Mubarak in Egypt and Qaddafi in Libya were toppled, their longstanding protection of minorities also ended. Now, ISIS is looking to eradicate Christians and other minorities altogether. The group twists the early history of Christians in the region — their subjugation by the sword — to legitimize its millenarian enterprise. Recently, ISIS posted videos delineating the second-class status of Christians in the caliphate. Those unwilling to pay the jizya tax or to convert would be destroyed, the narrator warned, as the videos culminated in the now-­infamous scenes of Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians in Libya being marched onto the beach and beheaded, their blood running into the surf.

The future of Christianity in the region of its birth is now uncertain. ‘‘How much longer can we flee before we and other minorities become a story in a history book?’’ says Nuri Kino, a journalist and founder of the advocacy group Demand for Action. According to a Pew study, Christians face religious persecution in more countries than any other religious group. ‘‘ISIL has put a spotlight on the issue,’’ says Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, whose parents are from the region and who advocates on behalf of Eastern Christians. ‘‘Christianity is under an existential threat.’’

One of the main pipelines for Christians fleeing the Middle East runs through Lebanon. This spring, thousands of Christians from villages in northeastern Syria along the Khabur River found shelter in Lebanon as they fled an ISIS assault in which 230 people were seized for ransom. This wasn’t the first time that members of this tight-knit community had been driven from their homes. Many of these villagers were descendants of those who, in 1933, fled Iraq after a massacre of Assyrian Christians left 3,000 dead in one day.

On a recent Saturday, 50 of these refugees gathered for a funeral at the Assyrian Church of the East in Beirut, which sits on the steep slope of Mount Lebanon, not far from a BMW-Mini Cooper dealership and a Miss Virgin Jeans shop. The priest, the Rev. Sargon Zoumaya, buttoned his black cassock over a blue clerical shirt as he prepared to officiate over the burial of Benjamin Ishaya, who arrived just months before, displaced from one of the villages ISIS attacked. (He had died of complications following a head wound inflicted by a jihadist.)

‘‘We’re afraid our whole society will vanish,’’ said Zoumaya, who left his Khabur River village more than a decade ago to study in Lebanon. He picked up his prayer book and headed downstairs to the parish house. The church was helping to care for 1,500 Syrian families. ‘‘It’s too much pressure on us, more than we can handle,’’ he said. The families didn’t want to live in the notoriously overcrowded Lebanese refugee camps that had filled with one-and-a-half million Syrians fleeing the civil war. They no longer wanted to live among Muslims. Instead they crammed into apartments with exorbitant rents that the church subsidized as best it could.

Inside the church, men and women sat in two separate circles. A young woman passed out Turkish coffee in paper cups. Waves of keening rose from the ring of women, led by Ishaya’s widow. Wearing an olive green suit, she sat at the head of the open coffin, weeping, as women touched her husband’s body. Nearby, her son, Bassam Ishaya, nursed two broken feet. He’d been trying to support his family by repairing couches until one dropped on him. The Ishaya family left Syria with nothing. ISIS, Bassam said, told them they ‘‘either had to pay the jizya, convert or be killed.’’ He pointed to a blue crucifix tattoo on his right arm. ‘‘Because of this, I had to wear long sleeves,’’ he said.

To escape, the Ishayas were airlifted from Al-Hasakah, a town in northeastern Syria, which had been under the joint control of the Assad government and the Kurds but has since largely fallen to ISIS, and flown 400 miles to Damascus. From there, they drove to the Lebanese border. Syrian Air charged $180 for the flights; Assad’s government charged $50 a person, the refugees at the funeral said.

Since the civil war broke out in Syria in 2011, Assad has allowed Christians to leave the country. Nearly a third of Syria’s Christians, about 600,000, have found themselves with no choice but to flee the country, driven out by extremist groups like the Nusra Front and now ISIS. ‘‘As president, he made the sheep and the wolf walk together,’’ Bassam said. ‘‘We don’t care if he stays or goes, we just want security.’’ Assad has used the rise of ISIS to solidify his own support among those who remain, sowing the same fear among them that he tries to spread in the West: that he is the only thing standing in the way of an ISIS takeover. This argument has been largely effective. As Samy Gemayel, leader of the Kataeb party in Lebanon, said: ‘‘When Christians saw Christians being beheaded, those who saw Assad as the enemy chose the lesser of two evils. Assad was the diet version of ISIS.’’

Like most of the refugees in the parish house, Bassam wasn’t planning on returning to Syria. He was searching for a way to the West. His brother Yussef moved to Chicago two years earlier. He didn’t have a job yet, but his wife worked at Walmart. Maybe they would help. He wanted to leave like everyone else, although it would hasten the end of Christianity in Syria. No one would go home after what ISIS had done. ‘‘Christians will all leave,’’ he said. ‘‘What can I do? I have four kids, I can’t leave them here to die.’’

After his father’s coffin was sealed, Bassam and the rest of the male mourners filed out. As the women looked on, the men filled waiting cars and drove, past a cement factory, to a nearby graveyard. Zoumaya swung a censer of frankincense along the narrow pathway. But neither the smoke nor the wilting rose bushes could mask the reek of corpses. Behind the priest, Bassam hobbled on crutches. The mourners lifted the coffin into a wall of doors, which resembled the shelving units in a morgue. This was a pauper’s grave. Since the family couldn’t afford the fee, the church paid $500 to place the coffin here. In a few months, the body would be quietly burned, although cremation is anathema to Eastern Christian doctrine. The ashes would take up less space in this overcrowded city of the dead.

‘‘We ran from the war only to die in the street,’’ one mourner said.

Later, Zoumaya talked of his family members, who were among the 230 captured by ISIS. At noon, on the day ISIS arrived in his wife’s village, Zoumaya called his father-in-law to check in.

‘‘This is ISIS,’’ said the man who answered.

‘‘Please let my family go,’’ the priest begged. ‘‘They’ve done nothing to you. They’re not fighting.’’

‘‘These people belong to us now,’’ the man said. ‘‘Who is this calling?’’

Zoumaya hung up. He feared what ISIS might do if they knew who he was. But this was not the end of his communication with them; they sent him photographs via WhatsApp. He pulled out his phone to show them. Here was a jihadi on a motorcycle, grinning in front of the charred grocery store that belonged to his father. Here was a photo, before ISIS arrived, of a 3-month-old’s baptism. Here was a snapshot of the family dressed up for Somikka, Assyrian Halloween, during which adults don frightening costumes to scare children into fasting for Lent.

‘‘All these people are missing,’’ he said.

ISIS wants $23 million for these captives, $100,000 each, a sum no one can pay.

This spring the U.N. Security Council met to discuss the plight of Iraq’s religious minorities. ‘‘If we attend to minority rights only after slaughter has begun, then we have already failed,’’ Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the high commissioner for Human Rights, said. After the conference ended, there was mounting anger at American inaction. Although the airstrikes were effective, since October 2013, the United States has given just $416 million in humanitarian aid, which falls far short of what is needed. ‘‘Americans and the West were telling us they came to bring democracy, freedom and prosperity,’’ Louis Sako, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch of Babylon who addressed the Security Council, wrote to me in a recent email. ‘‘What we are living is anarchy, war, death and the plight of three million refugees.’’

Of the 3.1 million displaced Iraqis, 85 percent are Sunnis. No one has suffered more at the hands of ISIS than fellow Muslims. Other religious minorities have been affected as well and in large numbers: the Yazidis, who were trapped on Mount Sinjar in Northern Iraq last summer, as ISIS threatened them with genocide; as well as Shia Turkmen; Shabak; Kaka’i; and the Mandeans, who follow John the Baptist. ‘‘Everyone has seen the forced conversions, crucifixions and beheadings,’’ David Saperstein, the United States ambassador at large for religious freedom, said. ‘‘To see these communities, primarily Christians, but also the Yazidis and others, persecuted in such large numbers is deeply alarming.’’

It has been nearly impossible for two U.S. presidents — Bush, a conservative evangelical; and Obama, a progressive liberal — to address the plight of Christians explicitly for fear of appearing to play into the crusader and ‘‘clash of civilizations’’ narratives the West is accused of embracing. In 2007, when Al Qaeda was kidnapping and killing priests in Mosul, Nina Shea, who was then a U.S. commissioner for religious freedom, says she approached the secretary of state at the time, Condoleezza Rice, who told her the United States didn’t intervene in ‘‘sectarian’’ issues. Rice now says that protecting religious freedom in Iraq was a priority both for her and for the Bush administration. But the targeted violence and mass Christian exodus remained unaddressed. ‘‘One of the blind spots of the Bush administration was the inability to grapple with this as a direct byproduct of the invasion,’’ says Timothy Shah, the associate director of Georgetown University’s Religious Freedom Project.

More recently, the White House has been criticized for eschewing the term ‘‘Christian’’ altogether. The issue of Christian persecution is politically charged; the Christian right has long used the idea that Christianity is imperiled to rally its base. When ISIS massacred Egyptian Copts in Libya this winter, the State Department came under fire for referring to the victims merely as ‘‘Egyptian citizens.’’ Daniel Philpott, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, says, ‘‘When ISIS is no longer said to have religious motivations nor the minorities it attacks to have religious identities, the Obama administration’s caution about religion becomes excessive.’’

Last fall, Obama did refer to Christians and other religious minorities by name in a speech, saying, ‘‘we cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands.’’ When ISIS threatened to eradicate the Yazidis, ‘‘it was the United States that stepped in to beat back the militants,’’ Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the National Security Council, says. In northeastern Syria, where ISIS is still launching attacks against Assyrian Christian villages, the U.S. military recently come to their aid, Baskey added. Refugees are a thornier issue. Of the more than 122,000 Iraqi refugees admitted to the United States, nearly 40 percent already belong to oppressed minorities. Admitting more would be difficult. ‘‘There are limits to what the international community can do,’’ Saperstein said.

Eshoo, the Democratic congresswoman, is working to establish priority refugee status for minorities who want to leave Iraq. ‘‘It’s a hair ball,’’ she says. ‘‘The average time for admittance to the United States is more than 16 months, and that’s too long. Many will die.’’ But it can be difficult to rally widespread support. The Middle East’s Christians often favor Palestine over Israel. And because support of Israel is central to the Christian Right — Israel must be occupied by the Jews before Jesus can return — this stance distances Eastern Christians from a powerful lobby that might otherwise champion their cause. Recently, Ted Cruz admonished an audience of Middle Eastern Christians at an In Defense of Christians event in Washington, telling them that Christians ‘‘have no better ally than the Jewish state.’’ Cruz was booed.

The fate of Christians in the Middle East isn’t simply a matter of religion; it is also integral to what kinds of societies will flourish as the region’s map fractures. In Lebanon, for example, where Christians have always played a powerful role in government, they increasingly serve as a buffer between Sunni and Shia. For nearly 70 years, Lebanon was a proxy battleground for the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Across the region, that conflict is now secondary to the shifting tectonic plates of the Sunni-Shia divide, which threatens terrible bloodshed.

Earlier this year, Lebanon closed its borders to almost everyone escaping the war in Syria but made an exception for Christians fleeing ISIS. When the extremists attacked the villages along the Khabur River, the interior minister, Nouhad Machnouk, ordered the official in charge of the border to allow Christians to enter the country. ‘‘I can’t put this in writing,’’ the border official said. Machnouk replied, ‘‘O.K., say it aloud, word by word.’’

Machnouk told me this story on a recent evening. ‘‘They’re paying much, much, much more than others,’’ in both Syria and Iraq, he said. ‘‘They’re not Sunni and not Shia, but they’re paying more than both.’’ We sat in his airy office, housed in a former art school from the Ottoman era. It was decorated with his private collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, including a carved basalt head with finely wrought curls. For the minister, a moderate Sunni, sheltering Christians is as much a sociopolitical imperative as a moral one.

In Lebanon, the tension between Sunni and Shia plays out in a system of political patronage, which has split the Christian community into two rival political parties, both born of the country’s 15-year-long civil war. The pro-Saudi Future movement, which consists of mainly Sunnis, supports the Christian leader Samir Geagea, who lives atop Mount Lebanon behind three check points, two X-ray machines and a set of steel doors. Hezbollah, which is Shia and backed by Iran, has been openly allied since 2006 with the Free Patriotic Movement (F.P.M.), a Christian Party headed by Michel Aoun. For Hezbollah, Christians offer an opportunity to forge an alliance with a fellow minority. (Of the world’s one and a half billion Muslims, only 10 to 20 percent are Shia.)

‘‘It’s a political game,’’ Alain Aoun, a member of Parliament for the F.P.M. and Michel Aoun’s nephew, told me. The emergence of ISIS has strengthened the alliance. ‘‘The Christians are happy to have anyone who can fight against I.S.’’ Hezbollah has paid young Christian men from Lebanon’s impoverished Bekaa Valley a one-time $500 to $2,000 fee to fight ISIS.

‘‘Christians here are making the same calculation that Obama does,’’ Hanin Ghaddar, the managing editor of NOW, a news website in Lebanon, said, referring to Obama’s willingness to support Iran as a bulwark against Sunni extremism. For many Christians in the Middle East, a Shia alliance offers a hope of survival, however slim. Ghaddar, an independent Shia, says that it is uncertain how these tenuous allegiances will play out. This spring, pro-Iranian forces of Hezbollah were battling Sunni extremists in Syria. No one knew who would prevail. ‘‘It’s like ‘Game of Thrones,’ ’’ she said. ‘‘We’re waiting for the snow to melt.’’

The front line against ISIS in Northern Iraq is marked by an earthen berm that runs for hundreds of miles over the Nineveh Plain. A string of Christian towns now stands empty, and the Kurdish forces occupy what, for thousands of years, was Assyrian, Chaldean and Syriac land. In one, Telskuf, seized by ISIS last year, the main square is overgrown with brambles and thistles. It was once a thriving market town. Every Thursday, hundreds came to buy clothes, honey and vegetables. Telskuf was home to 7,000 people; now only three remain.

The Nineveh Plain Forces, a 500-member Assyrian Christian militia, patrols the town. The N.P.F. is one of five Assyrian militias formed during the past year after the rout of ISIS. It shares a double aim with two other militias, Dwekh Nawsha, an all-volunteer force of around 100, and the Nineveh Plains Protection Units, a battalion of more than 300: to help liberate Christian lands from ISIS and to protect their people, possibly as part of a nascent national guard, when they return home. The two other militias are the Syriac Military Council, which is fighting alongside the Kurds in northeastern Syria, and the Babylonian Brigades, which operate under Iraq’s Shia-dominated militias.

A few of these militias are aided by a handful of American, Canadian and British citizens, who, frustrated with their governments’ lack of response to ISIS, have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight on their own. Some come in the name of fellow Christians. Some come to relive their roles in the United States invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan — or to make amends for them. One American named Matthew VanDyke, the founder of Sons of Liberty International, a security company, has provided free training for the N.P.U. and is now about to work with a second militia, Dwekh Nawsha. VanDyke, who is 36, traveled to Libya in 2011 to fight against Muammar el-Qaddafi’s forces; he was captured and spent 166 days in solitary confinement before escaping and returning to combat. He has no formal military training, but since last fall, he has brought American veterans to Iraq to help the N.P.U., including James Halterman, a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, who found the group on the Internet after watching a segment about Westerners fighting ISIS on Fox News. The United States government does not support groups like VanDyke’s. ‘‘Americans who have traveled to Iraq to fight are not part of U.S. efforts in the region,’’ Joseph Pennington, the consul general in Erbil, says. ‘‘We wish they would not come here.’’

In Iraq, the militias operate at the front only with the approval of the Kurdish peshmerga, who are using the fight against ISIS to expand their territory into the Nineveh Plain, long a disputed territory between Arabs and Kurds. Even to travel 1,000 yards between bases and forward posts, the Christian militias must ask the Kurds for permission. The Kurds are looking to integrate all the Christian militias into their force; they have succeeded with the N.P.F. and two others. But the N.P.U. remains wary. They fear that the Kurds are using the Christian cause to seize territory for a greater Kurdistan. And because the Kurdish forces abandoned them as ISIS approached, the militias want the right to protect their own people. For now, they make do with the help they can find. Romeo Hakari, the head of the N.P.F., said, ‘‘We want U.S. trainers, but we can’t even afford to buy weapons.’’ After his militia purchased 20 AK-47s in an open market in Erbil, the Kurds gave them 100 more.

Other than a daily mortar or two launched by ISIS from a village a mile and a half away, the area the N.P.U. patrolled was a sleepy target. After coalition airstrikes pushed ISIS out of Telskuf last summer, the group retreated about a mile and a half to the southwest. Beyond a bulldozed trench and a line of burlap sandbags littered with sunflower-seed shells, 12 black flags fluttered over a village. Three weeks earlier, at 4:20 a.m., two suicide bombers carrying a ladder to place over the trench attacked this forward post. The suicide attack was foiled after the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS launched airstrikes, which killed 13 ISIS fighters, Manaf Yussef, a Kurdish security official in charge of this front, said. ‘‘Without airstrikes, we’d lose,’’ he said. Minutes later, a high whistle signaled an incoming ISIS shell, which set fire to a nearby wheat field. The land is sere due to a drought.

As a column of smoke from the daily ISIS shell billowed into the blue sky, five Assyrian fighters belonging to the Nineveh Plain Forces went from house to house to evacuate the last residents of Telskuf — three old women. When the N.P.F. commander, Safaa Khamro, pushed open the door of the first house, Christina Jibbo Kakhosh began to cry. She was 91.

‘‘I have no running water,’’ she said. Less than four feet tall, she peered up at Khamro through bottle-thick glasses.

‘‘I fixed it for you yesterday,’’ Khamro said.

‘‘I forgot,’’ she said. She shuffled back inside and beckoned him to follow. Her refrigerator was flung open; because there was no electricity, it served as a pantry. A half-eaten jar of tahini, a lighter and a pair of scissors sat on a table in front of the mattress on which she slept. When she heard her visitors were American, she said: ‘‘Three of my children are in America. Only one has called me.’’

Khamro tried to persuade her to come to a house near the base where she would be safer. ‘‘It has satellite TV,’’ he said. She packed a small satchel and left with the patrol. ‘‘That’s my uncle’s house,’’ one Assyrian fighter said as he passed a padlocked gate. ‘‘He’s in Australia now.’’ The patrol passed St. Jacob’s Church, where ISIS fighters had destroyed a porcelain statue of Jesus, which was now missing its face. An icon of a martyr having his fingers cut off by Tamerlane, who massacred tens of thousands of Assyrian Christians during the 14th century, hung on the wall.

Nearby, the N.P.F. had replaced the cross that ISIS fighters filmed themselves hurling down. Khamro was a politician in Telskuf before ISIS invaded. He owned one of the 480 now-shuttered shops, a boutique that sold women’s and children’s clothes. He’d sent his wife and children to Al Qosh, 10 miles to the north, a safer Christian city.

Khamro turned off the main drag and into a warren of overgrown pathways. He stopped before a chicken-wire awning, calling out ‘‘Auntie’’ to Kamala Karim Shaya, who sat on her front stoop, a kerchief tied over her thick white ponytail. When she learned that Khamro had come to move her out of her clay home, she began to scream: ‘‘Even if my father stands up in his grave, I will not leave this house. No, no, no, no, no, never, never, never,’’ she shouted. Khamro, who refused to move her by force, had no choice but to pass on.

Even if ISIS is defeated, the fate of religious minorities in Syria and Iraq remains bleak. Unless minorities are given some measure of security, those who can leave are likely to do so. Nina Shea of the Hudson Institute, a conservative policy center, says that the situation has grown so dire that Iraqi Christians must either be allowed full residency in Kurdistan, including the right to work, or helped to leave. Others argue that it is essential that minorities have their own autonomous region. Exile is a death knell for these communities, activists say. ‘‘We’ve been here as an ethnicity for 6,000 years and as Christians for 1,700 years,’’ says Dr. Srood Maqdasy, a member of the Kurdish Parliament. ‘‘We have our own culture, language and tradition. If we live within other communities, all of this will be dissolved within two generations.’’

The practical solution, according to many Assyrian Christians, is to establish a safe haven on the Nineveh Plain. ‘‘If the West could take in so many refugees and the U.N.H.C.R. handle an operation like that, then we wouldn’t ask for a permanent solution,’’ says Nuri Kino, of A Demand for Action. ‘‘But the most realistic option is returning home.’’

‘‘We don’t have time to wait for solutions,’’ said the Rev. Emanuel Youkhana, the head of Christian Aid Program Northern Iraq. ‘‘For the first time in 2,000 years, there are no church services in Mosul. The West comes up with one solution by granting visas to a few hundred people. What about a few hundred thousand?’’ If Iraq devolves into three regions — Sunnis, Shia and Kurds — there could be a fourth for minorities. ‘‘Iraq is a forced marriage between Sunni, Shia, Kurds and Christians, and it failed,’’ Youkhana said. ‘‘Even I, as a priest, favor divorce.’’

Proponents say a safe haven wouldn’t require an international force or a no-fly zone, neither of which is likely to find much support in the United States or among its allies. U.S. policy does play a role. When Congress was asked to approve $1.6 billion in aid for Iraqi forces fighting ISIS — the Iraqi Army, the Kurds and the Sunni tribes — it amended the bill to explicitly include local forces on the Nineveh Plain, but also passed legislation directing the State Department to implement a safe haven there. Ultimately, however, the responsibility lies with the Iraqis. Pennington, the consul general, said, ‘‘The creation of a safe haven in the Nineveh Province would be an idea for the Iraqi Parliament in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution.’’

Tarek Mitri, a former Lebanese minister and a former special representative to the U.N. secretary general for Libya, says that his impression in speaking to officials in the White House ‘‘is that Obama is in a withdrawal mood. He thinks that he was elected to withdraw from Afghanistan and Iraq and to make a deal with Iran. If this is the mood, then we shouldn’t expect much or ask much from the Americans.’’ Baskey, of the National Security Council, counters that ‘‘rather than withdrawing, the president and this administration have, in fact, remained deeply engaged, building and leading a coalition of some 60 nations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.’’

The last time Rana, one of the women taken by ISIS from Qaraqosh, was able to speak to her family by phone was in September. She told them what had befallen Rita and Christina. Rita had been given as a slave to a powerful member of ISIS; Christina was given to a family to be raised as a Muslim.

Rana said little about her own circumstances, and her family didn’t ask. To be honest, they weren’t sure they wanted to know what ISIS had done to her.

For months now, the phone Rana used has been switched off. ‘‘There’s word they’re still alive,’’ Rabee Mano, 36, a refugee from Qaraqosh who runs an underground railroad out of the Islamic State, told me one recent evening over beer and kebabs. ‘‘She’s been ‘married’ to a powerful guy in ISIS,’’ he added, as he sat in the garden at the Social Academic Center in Ankawa, a Christian suburb of Erbil. At the next table, three gleeful men poured straight vodka into plastic cups. Over the past year, Ankawa has swelled by 60,000 as refugees have poured in.

For nearly a year, Mano has been trying to buy freedom for Rana, Rita and Christina from ISIS. Through his network of contacts, a greedy ISIS member, friends in Arab villages and a brave taxi driver, Mano has paid to free 45 people. The haggling is made easier by the fact that ISIS members frequently trade women among themselves, so the buying and selling of people doesn’t raise suspicion. This work has cost him $10,000, which he raised by opening a carwash. He sent $800 to a member of ISIS, saying he would send more when the women and the child made it to safety. But the man had done nothing of what he promised.

Before Mano fled his hometown last August, he dealt in commercial real estate. ‘‘You can see my buildings from Google Earth,’’ he said. At the picnic table, he pulled an expired Arizona driver’s license from his wallet. It was a temporary license from 2011, the year he came to the United States and tried to buy 48 apartments. The deal fell through, so he went home; now his passport had expired. He lost about $1.5 million, he said.

He longed to return to the Nineveh Plain. ‘‘Even though all of my money is in the garbage, I’ll be O.K. if we get this safe haven,’’ he said. ‘‘If it takes too long, we’ll be annihilated.’’ It was all he thought about. ‘‘Are we going home or not?’’ he asked. ‘‘This safe haven is the last chance we have, or Christianity will be finished in Iraq.’’

Earlier, a text message came in from Mosul. One of his contacts was having trouble locating a woman named Nabila, who was ready to be smuggled to safety. Mano had instructed her to hang a black cloth in her window so that her rescuer could find the right house. But the wind had blown the cloth to the ground, and now her would-be rescuer couldn’t tell where she was being held. They would have to try again. ‘‘I’ll tell her to hang a blanket,’’ Mano said. They would find her, he hoped, if the blanket held its weight against the wind.",REAL
How Taye Diggs Is Transforming the Role of Hedwig,"Diggs, until now, has been the kind of sex symbol you could marry. He plays stable, intelligent, sane guys, like the good doctor Sam Bennett on ‘‘Grey’s Anatomy’’ and its spinoff, ‘‘Private Practice,’’ and the hapless novelist Harper Stewart in the highly popular and profitable black upscale comedy ‘‘The Best Man’’ (1999) and its sequels. Diggs’s roles aren’t irritatingly wholesome dweebs, or overly ambitious jerks, or capricious bad boys, but brothers who could wear Tommy Hilfiger while playing croquet and still look as if they were keeping it halfway real. If you start to salivate when you hear the phrase ‘‘black men with jobs,’’ then Diggs is your guy.

Though Diggs has seen ‘‘Hedwig’’ many times — he’s a Broadway boy, after all, who got one of his first breaks as part of the original cast of ‘‘Rent’’ — he admits that the first time, it freaked him out. ‘‘I was young, and back then, transgender scared me, and there was this man onstage with a crazy wig,’’ he said. Then he had a gradual, though radical, change of heart. ‘‘Since I was a kid, I’ve been trying to wean myself off of seeing things as right and wrong and black and white and good and bad. And Hedwig was a mixture of all that stuff.’’ It became a role he dreamed of doing. ‘‘But I didn’t think it would ever happen,’’ he said. ‘‘I assumed that nobody would ever have the open-mindedness to cast this character black.’’ Au contraire, mon hunk!

Trask sees hiring Diggs as an augmentation of the show’s original mission statement. ‘‘The whole point of many of the songs and much of the subject matter of the show,’’ he says, ‘‘was to break down the walls between different categories that we perceive as being opposites, like male and female or straight and gay.’’ With the demolition of the Berlin Wall as the musical’s central metaphor for the destruction of binary thinking, it makes sense that obliterating the line between black and white would follow.

That said, while watching Diggs in rehearsal, you immediately notice how his presence makes the show’s many European influences stand out. I think of the Zora Neale Hurston quote smeared across the artist Glenn Ligon’s canvases: ‘‘I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background.’’ ‘‘Hedwig’’ mines Greek myth for inspiration: You can’t get much whiter than drawing from the foundation of the Western liberal arts education, though some of the classical ideas the show borrows are queer. The song ‘‘The Origin of Love’’ updates Aristophanes’s speech about the nature of gender and sexuality from Plato’s ‘‘Symposium’’ — ‘‘There were three sexes then,’’ one verse begins. Sure. But his blackness is thrown into relief. I noticed this particularly at the start of the show, as Hedwig develops her gestalt and recounts her musical influences: They are soft-rock white ladies (Toni Tennille, Debby Boone) and hard-rock white dudes (Lou Reed, Iggy Pop). I feel a bit sad to think that a black European kid of the era might not have discovered the German black glitz-funk band Boney M. But that lament is esoteric enough to feel slightly unfair (and later in the show, Hedwig does mention Tina Turner and Aretha Franklin). It’s more exciting to assume that the creators simply chose Diggs and leapt in, knowing they would have to reshape the show around him, but not exactly how.

Slide Show

The dining room of the Lambs Club, a glitzy showbiz hangout right across the street from the theater, was mostly empty on the Tuesday night when I arrived to meet Diggs. The restaurant’s interior was all ribbed red and black neo-Art Deco — shiny leather banquettes, mirrors, crisp white tablecloths. Generic soul music played at a pleasant volume, creating the odd sensation of being on the set of a Taye Diggs film.

I found Diggs facing the back wall in the rear of the dining room, presumably so that no one would recognize him. He wore a black T-shirt that revealed the tattoos on his arms: One says RISE inside a black box, the other is a drawing by his son that resembles a cave painting, accompanied by the words I LOVE YOU DADDY in kid-scrawl. By his side, his trademark fedora sat on his duffel bag. He was a little bit slumped in his chair after an eight-hour rehearsal, and he seemed to be muttering to himself. When I tapped his arm to get his attention, I saw there was a script in his lap and he was memorizing his lines. ‘‘Tonight I’ll go over this with my mom,’’ he said, hiding the script in his bag. His mother, Marcia Berry-Diggs, was staying in Harlem, conveniently; an actor and a teacher, she frequently gives him expert advice.

‘‘This role is somewhat representative of my life right now,’’ he said, without acknowledging how strange that sounds, given who Hedwig is. He has not appeared on Broadway in more than a decade, and he spoke wistfully of his recent (reportedly amicable) divorce from his wife of 10 years, the ‘‘Frozen’’ snow queen and ‘‘Wicked’’ Tony-winner Idina Menzel. The two of them met when they both starred in ‘‘Rent’’; their son, Walker, was born in 2009. Perhaps taking this part falls into that category of crazy things newly divorced guys do to express their autonomy. Before the first course arrived, he blurted out: ‘‘I tip my hat to Idina. She’s been doing it’’ — this kind of Broadway work, he means — ‘‘and with Walker. I look at her with even more respect and a little bit of awe. TV is like a walk in the park,” he said, compared with this.

‘‘It’s not like you’ve never done it before,’’ I said.

‘‘Not like this.’’

He seemed almost dazed. Our fast-talking, decisive waiter, a brother with bolt-upright posture, expertly provided long descriptions of the dishes, involving tarragon jus and glazed lamb belly, and ended up choosing his entree for him (it wasn’t until the check arrived that the waiter let on that he recognized Diggs, wishing him luck with the show). Maybe it was his exhaustion, but Diggs appeared to think very hard about everything that crossed his mind. His movements all took place as if in slow-mo, whether he squinted, smiled or nodded. When he moved his jaw to speak or chew, his scalp undulated.

Diggs has built a bankable career largely by playing successful black men, with not a gang member or drug fiend among them. I admire him for finding gold in that small niche, but after representing so many role models, I can see why he wants to break out and be outrageous. It will be a reach: I can detect little difference between the solid, dependable men he usually plays and his actual demeanor. He does not seem uncomfortable with his image on any front. Asked if it bothers him that people constantly objectify him, he said: ‘‘I can’t really complain. I grew up skinny and nerdy, so there are worse things.’’ A tuna tartare arrived garnished with a caper-like vegetable neither of us could identify. Diggs poked at it and muttered, ‘‘Fancy,’’ as if most of his daily life did not already merit that word.

The man born Scott Berry — Taye was shortened from the nickname Scotty, which was pronounced “Scott-taye” — did not grow up particularly fancy. He was born in 1971 in Newark to Marcia Berry and a visual artist named Andre Young, and then moved, at age 3 or 4, to Rochester. ‘‘The family was me and my mother,’’ he explains. ‘‘She wanted to get away,” he continues, “so she moved to Rochester, New York.’’ He never knew his father.

In Rochester, his mother met and married Jeffries Diggs and had four more children with him. Taye adopted his last name. His stepfather took the family on a whirlwind tour of many religious denominations — Catholic, Pentecostal, Baptist, even Jews for Jesus, ‘‘or something of that nature,’’ Diggs says. In the ’70s, they also changed neighborhoods a lot, which may help explain Diggs’s open-mindedness; at many points in his life, it must have been a survival skill. This quality has clearly served him as a man of color navigating not one but three cutthroat worlds — Broadway, Hollywood and America.

His parents were strict and protective — ‘‘I was never out late, I was never hanging with the wrong crowd; that wasn’t even an option,’’ he told me — but they made the surprising choice to send him to high school at Rochester’s School of the Arts, a progressive public school in the city’s cultural district, where he had lessons in experimental theater and Afro-Caribbean dance. ‘‘I remember at the time I didn’t want to leave my friends at the other school,’’ Diggs recalls, ‘‘even though I wasn’t doing much. But then once I got there, I shone.’’

Ah, a rare moment in which Diggs directs a compliment toward himself. He’s so modest that he follows nearly 500,000 people on Twitter. That’s him following them. His gameness has become a running Internet joke. Humility and ambivalence pour so easily from him that everyone within range seems to want to help him. ‘‘I’m attracted to nice people, people that are kind, to a certain extent selfless,’’ he tells you. If ‘‘Hedwig’’ goes well, I think, perhaps his next role will be Blanche DuBois? But then I think: That’s me! I’m kind! I’m to a certain extent selfless! But my reverie is cut short when Diggs glances at his watch, picks up his bag and fedora and goes off to meet his mother. He’s got a role to inhabit, the strangest one of his life.

The creators of ‘‘Hedwig and the Angry Inch’’ must recognize that casting Diggs is a powerful, timely move. They’re celebrating both the ambiguity of gender and the beauty and skill of a black actor at a time when displays of black people’s bodies in peril have become daily news. But it wouldn’t be like them to say that they were trying to inject even more political complexity into the show. It would seem too obvious, or too much pressure to put on an effervescent musical.

Some people who see the show will probably raise the age-old objection to the spectacle of black male performers cross-dressing. The roster of comedy stars who have regularly done drag is almost a who’s who of top-grossing black comics: Flip Wilson, Tyler Perry, Martin Lawrence, Eddie Murphy. Black folks wary of mainstream — that is to say, predominantly white — tastes argue that white consumers are reveling in the degradation of black masculinity. In 2006, for example, Dave Chappelle insinuated, while speaking to Oprah Winfrey, that doing drag has negative effects on the black male image, and that white power brokers coerce these black stars into feminizing themselves all the way to the bank.

But seeing drag as fundamentally degrading is definitely close-minded, and possibly homophobic. Criticisms of this sort have never gotten any traction in the theater world, where eine kleine nachtemasculation might be just what the doctor ordered for macho cultures. If any misgivings about feminizing black men (or men of any color, really) were raised with Mitchell or Trask, they would voluptuously roll their eyes in response. These peacocks wouldn’t care if you put a sack of Idaho potatoes onstage in drag as long as it could sing.

A few days after our dinner, I caught up with Diggs at Soho House, a members-only club in the Meatpacking District to which he belongs. The dining room had the hushed elegance of a library, with windows overlooking the bustle of Ninth Avenue on a sunny Saturday late afternoon and an abundance of unfinished round wooden tables. Diggs is a regular here, and he seemed more relaxed, even though he had bitten his tongue during one of those eight-hour rehearsals. ‘‘It doesn’t hurt to talk,’’ he reassured me. Later I noticed a bright spot of blood in his mouth.

Upstairs, on the roof deck, dance music blasted and a crowd of half-naked sunbathers swarmed around a swimming pool like some MTV special on 30-somethings. People know Diggs here — a fit young woman with voluminous Beyoncé hair who used to date a friend came over to say hello; later, a pal with a bright gold grill covering his upper and lower front teeth sat down, describing himself as a ‘‘visual artist-slash-troublemaker.’’ Enthusiastic about the grill, Diggs said that he wanted one, too — ‘‘Some kind of a deal where it’s just one tooth.’’

Despite his image as a debonair race man, Diggs seems never to have gone through the requisite period of self-consciousness about macho posturing. Starring in “Rent” at 25 must have accelerated his evolution. He apparently doesn’t share any of Chappelle’s anxiety: For him, donning Hedwig’s wig seems to highlight a more personal transformation. Before divorcing, Diggs says, he clung to labels as keys to his identity — husband, father, actor, black, man. But afterward, everything changed — ‘‘aggressively, and in a fierce way.’’ Nevertheless, Diggs remains open to possibility. If you can credit Hedwig’s high-profile boundary-bashing with gaining more acceptance for L.G.B.T. people, surely the show can unbutton a heretofore strait-laced black actor’s image and open doors for everyone else.

The role of Hedwig is ‘‘everything I’ve ever wished for,’’ he said. Then he turned, in what seems unusual for him, ferocious: ‘‘This is me telling myself, ‘O.K., bitch, put your money where your mouth is. You’ve been telling agents and your best friends — I told Idina — ‘I want a chance to show everybody everything. I can dance and I can sing, and everybody knows I can act.’ ’’

‘‘Well,’’ I heard myself say, as if I were Diggs’ life coach, ‘‘Everybody wants you to do well, and nobody has a bad word to say about you.’’

He laughed heartily. ‘‘I hope that doesn’t change after they see me in this show! Oh, that would be awful.’’ But then he paused, his eyes narrow, his chin lowered slightly. ‘‘They’re going to end up saying something good. ’Cause I’m not gonna mess up all three.’’",REAL
Why Is It So Hard to Get a Great Bagel in California?,"Wise Sons deli now occupies a former taco joint on the corner of 24th and Shotwell Streets in San Francisco’s Mission District. They also have an outpost at the San Francisco Contemporary Jewish Museum. From the start, Beckerman says: ‘‘We knew making a bagel would open us up to so much criticism. There isn’t another product as personal as the bagel. It was already struggle enough.’’

Still, by mid-2014, Bloom, the more optimistic and heavily bearded of the Wise Sons pair, was lobbying his partner. ‘‘We need a great bagel,’’ Bloom said to Beckerman every day for a month. ‘‘How hard can it be?’’

The bagel, originally from Poland, has done poorly in the diaspora from New York. In the late 1920s in New Haven, a Polish immigrant named Harry Lender opened one of the first bagel shops outside New York City. Over the years, he grew tired of slow weekdays followed by hectic Saturday nights to meet the Sunday-morning rush. So in the early 1950s, without telling his customers, he started baking and freezing bagels through the week and selling them as fresh on Sunday. Nobody noticed for nearly two years. Lender then started selling them frozen and presliced in grocery stores. By 1984, when the Lender family sold the business to Kraft Foods, they were making more than two million bagels a day. To celebrate with their sales reps, Murray and Marvin Lender, two of Harry’s sons, walked Len, an eight-foot-tall Lender’s bagel, down the aisle to meet Phyl, his Kraft Philadelphia cream cheese bride.

Further bagel debasement followed. In 1995 Boston Chicken, which owned a string of restaurants, mostly in New England, saw an opening in the breakfast market, to compete with the doughnut. The company started buying mom-and-pop bagel bakeries, and the resulting Einstein Noah Restaurant Group now owns 852 bagel shops in 42 states. A very nice team of marketing and R. & D. people told me that the company, which uses steam ovens for its Noah’s bagels instead of boiling and baking separately, prides itself on its innovative flavors, like Cheddar jalapeño, as well as what it calls its ‘‘traditional’’ ones, like . . . blueberry.

The San Francisco bagel famine broke for a short time in 2011, when four former Dartmouth students started an outfit called Schmendricks. (The name means ‘‘stupid person’’ in Yiddish.) They decided to follow tech start-up protocol — ‘‘to A/B test our way to a perfect bagel,’’ says Dan Scholnick, one of the schmendricks who not at all stupidly kept his day job as a venture capitalist. By November 2011 they had a product ready to take to beta. So Schmendricks posted an announcement on Facebook and Twitter and placed a sign in front of Faye’s Video and Espresso Bar, across the street from Bi-Rite Market, a sort of Dean & DeLuca of San Francisco. Then, on the appointed morning, they showed up with four dozen bagels — and found a line stretching down the block. The bagel columnist for J., a Northern California Jewish weekly, described the product as ‘‘everything you could ever want.’’ But the glory didn’t last. Before Schmendricks opened a storefront, its bagel disappeared. ‘‘We were never going to grow the way a top-tier tech company is going to grow,’’ Scholnick told me, stating the obvious. Besides, after months of hand-rolling, Schmendricks’ primary baker discovered she had a gluten intolerance.

Other bagels emerged, none as beloved. After Dan Graf, 30, quit his job at Saul’s deli in Berkeley, he decided to take on the challenge. His boss at Saul’s, who trained under Alice Waters, encouraged Graf to go to New York and learn the bagel craft as most chefs learn technique — by apprenticing at a master’s knee. But instead, Graf, who majored in genetics, took a scientific approach, turning his apartment into a lab for isolating variables (proofing times, retarding times, baking times, ratio of malt to boiling water). He opened Baron Baking a few months later, when he achieved a dense midsize bagel he liked. He supplies Saul’s and does a brisk wholesale business, but when I presented one of his bagels to an East Coast transplant, he looked at it and said, ‘‘I don’t even want to taste it — I know it will make me sad.’’

Joe Wolf, of Marla, says his partner and wife, Amy Brown, did not refer back to any primary bagel source, either. ‘‘Amy never tasted a bagel and said, ‘I want to make a bagel like that!’ ’’ Wolf told me. What she makes now is a truly accomplished round bread product, with a tight crumb and a hint of sourness. Even Beauty’s Bagel Shop, which had been supplying Wise Sons, did not try to produce the New York bagel so many California Jews crave. Instead, the owners, Amy Remsen and Blake Joffe, veered toward the Montreal bagel, which is fine but more or less to a New York bagel what Chicago deep-dish pizza is to New York pizza. (A Montreal bagel, which is smaller and sweeter than a New York bagel, is baked in a wood oven and lacks salt.)

All of this makes you wonder if the problem is really cultural, if California bagel bakers are too hooked on innovation and culinary self-expression for the bagel’s good. Mitchell Davis of the Beard Foundation believes that the bagel, like ketchup, is a product ill served by current food trends. ‘‘The effect of artisanship does not always produce a better result,’’ he told me. What’s more, he says, an up-and-coming San Francisco baker may have a hard time realizing his fantasy of learning how to make a New York bagel from an authentic Jewish source. Not that it matters. Bagel baking remains the province of immigrants, even if it’s no longer particularly the province of Jews. Among the great bagel bakers right now is Samak Thongkrieng, who owns Absolute Bagel on Broadway near 107th Street. Thongkrieng came to New York from Thailand in 1980 and worked for three years at Ess-a-Bagel, considered by many to produce some of the best bagels in the city.

Late last year, Beckerman finally relented and agreed to make a bagel, much to the relief of Wise Sons’ fans. He continued, however, to worry about how those same customers would behave once they had an actual, not idealized, bagel in hand. Beckerman told me that his customers seem to feel entitled to express their disappointment, as if eating at Wise Sons were like eating at a family member’s home. About a year after the opening, a woman came in, ordered the matzo-ball soup, asked to speak to the chef and then proceeded to tell Beckerman that though his was O.K., it could be better. She returned a few days later with her own matzo-ball soup, as promised, as well as her specialty white-chocolate-and-cranberry mandelbrot. Beckerman sat down with her and ate.

This insistence on the part of customers to make the Wise Sons experience personal rather than transactional makes sense to Rabbi Michael Lezak, who lives in Marin County, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and leads Congregation Rodef Sholom. ‘‘San Francisco is a radically assimilated community,’’ Lezak explains. ‘‘So there’s something about being in an out, public Jewish space that’s rare here. We don’t have a Jewish neighborhood. Wise Sons serves a purpose for people who fled the East Coast.”

In New York, where he attended rabbinical school in the late 1990s, Lezak lived on First Avenue across the street from Ess-a-Bagel, which, he says, ‘‘lit me up in beautiful ways and left an imprint on my soul.’’ No California bagel, at present, affects Lezak in that way, but he is touched by Wise Sons. ‘‘Their challah is off the charts,’’ he says. ‘‘It’s a language for Shabbat.’’ Connecting to religion through food may be even more important for secular Jews. ‘‘Food is an easy vehicle; it’s a great first step,’’ Lezak says. ‘‘Religion needs to lead to something bigger, something outside yourself. But food can resuscitate your dead grandmother.’’ It evokes the past. ‘‘If we make a commitment to meet for lunch once a week at Wise Sons, you tell me about who is alive in your family and who is not, what your life is about,’’ he says. ‘‘That summons us toward something greater.’’ Many Jews, Lezak thinks, have arrested religious development — ‘‘their bar or bat mitzvah might be the last great religious experience they had,’’ he says. ‘‘They’re 13 years old, Jewishly.’’ Temple may be intimidating — not so a deli. As Beckerman notes, ‘‘We’re not asking about God here.’’

Beckerman destroyed two mixers in trying to perfect the bagel. But after just three test batches, Bloom said: ‘‘Go no further! That’s it!’’ So Beckerman started practicing the production of bagels at scale — first four dozen, then eight, up to his test run of 25 dozen, which he baked in Wise Sons’ commissary kitchen, on Mission and 22nd Street the morning of Jan. 28. The following day, Wise Sons planned to drop bags of bagels and cream cheese at its big San Francisco catering accounts, like Airbnb. The day after that, bagels for all.

That evening, Beckerman’s and Bloom’s phones started ringing. A text message arrived: ‘‘Bakery on fire. Not a joke.’’ Bloom set down the chopped liver he was serving to Warriors season-ticket holders at an event on the Embarcadero. By the time he’d raced up and over Potrero Hill to the three-story mixed-use building, he could smell the smoke. On Mission Street, along with a cluster of fire trucks, Bloom found Beckerman and their bakers, still in aprons, watching flames erupt from the building’s roof.

The fire, which started elsewhere in the building, was devastating; one of the building’s tenants died, and six others were hospitalized. The next day, Bloom and Beckerman came back to salvage a few things. Beckerman grabbed the rye starter and his brother’s bar mitzvah certificate. Bloom focused on the shorted-out machine that they had used to shape bagels.

This past spring, I drove with Bloom and Beckerman to look at a potential new space for both baking and selling bagels, near the corner of Geary and Fillmore Streets, a spot much closer to Congregations Sherith Israel and Emanu-El than their original deli. Rabbi Lezak believes a worthy bagel would make Jewish life in the Bay Area more complete. ‘‘My hope and prayer is that someday I’m schlepping into San Francisco on Sunday mornings for a bagel,’’ he told me.

The space turned out to be a rundown former sushi restaurant. Beckerman stared at the stained red walls and peeling linoleum floor. Ever optimistic, he said, ‘‘You gotta have vision to feed your dreams!’’

But not too much vision. After all, creativity is not the bagel’s friend. ‘‘The bagel is the Jewish madeleine,’’ says Niki Russ Federman, a fourth-generation owner of the New York appetizing store Russ & Daughters on the Lower East Side. ‘‘You bite into it, and you’re reminded of where you came from and who you are.’’",REAL
The Singular Mind of Terry Tao,"A few months later, halfway through the school year, Tao was moved up to 12th-grade math. Three years later, at age 10, Tao became the youngest person in history to win a medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad. He has since won many other prizes, including a MacArthur ‘‘genius’’ grant and the Fields Medal, considered the Nobel Prize for mathematicians. Today, many regard Tao as the finest mathematician of his generation.

That spring day in his office, reflecting on his career so far, Tao told me that his view of mathematics has utterly changed since childhood. ‘‘When I was growing up, I knew I wanted to be a mathematician, but I had no idea what that entailed,’’ he said in a lilting Australian accent. ‘‘I sort of imagined a committee would hand me problems to solve or something.’’ But it turned out that the work of real mathematicians bears little resemblance to the manipulations and memorization of the math student. Even those who experience great success through their college years may turn out not to have what it takes. The ancient art of mathematics, Tao has discovered, does not reward speed so much as patience, cunning and, perhaps most surprising of all, the sort of gift for collaboration and improvisation that characterizes the best jazz musicians. Tao now believes that his younger self, the prodigy who wowed the math world, wasn’t truly doing math at all. ‘‘It’s as if your only experience with music were practicing scales or learning music theory,’’ he said, looking into light pouring from his window. ‘‘I didn’t learn the deeper meaning of the subject until much later.’’

Possibly the greatest mathematician since antiquity was Carl Friedrich Gauss, a dour German born in the late 18th century. He did not get along with his own children and kept important results to himself, seeing them as unsuitable for public view. They were discovered among his papers after his death. Before and since, the annals of the field have teemed with variations on this misfit theme, from Isaac Newton, the loner with a savage temper; to John Nash, the ‘‘beautiful mind’’ whose work shaped economics and even political science, but who was racked by paranoid delusions; to, more recently, ­Grigory Perelman, the Russian who conquered the Poincaré conjecture alone, then refused the Fields Medal, and who also allowed his fingernails to grow until they curled.

Tao, by contrast, is, as one colleague put it, ‘‘super-normal.’’ He has a gentle, self-­deprecating manner. He eschews job offers from prestigious East Coast institutions in favor of a relaxed, no-drama department in a place where he can enjoy the weather. In class, he conveys a sense that mathematics is fun. One of his students told me that he had recently joked with another about the many ways Tao defies all the Hollywood mad-­genius tropes. ‘‘They will never make a movie about him,’’ he said. ‘‘He doesn’t have a troubled life. He has a family, and they seem happy, and he’s usually smiling.’’

This can be traced to his own childhood, which he experienced as super-normal, even if, to outside eyes, it was anything but. Tao’s family spent most of his early years living in the foothills south of Adelaide, in a brick split-­level with views of Gulf St. Vincent. The home was designed by his father, Billy, a pediatrician who immigrated with Tao’s mother, Grace, from Hong Kong in 1972, three years before Tao, the eldest of three, was born in 1975. The three boys — Nigel, Trevor and ‘‘Terry,’’ as everyone calls him — often played together, and a favorite pastime was inventing board games. They typically appropriated a Scrabble board for a basic grid, then brought in Scrabble tiles, chess pieces, Chinese checkers, mah-jongg tiles and Dungeons & Dragons dice, according to Nigel, who now works for Google. For story lines, they frequently drew from video games coming out at the time, like Super Mario Bros., then added layers of complex, whimsical rules. (Trevor, a junior chess champion, was too good to beat, so the boys created a variation on that game as well: Each turn began with a die roll to determine which piece could be moved.) Tao was a voracious consumer of fantasy books like Terry Pratchett’s Discworld series. When a class was boring, he doodled intricate maps of imaginary lands.

By the spring of 1985, with a 9-year-old Tao splitting time between high school and nearby Flinders University, Billy and Grace took him on a three-week American tour to seek advice from top mathematicians and education experts. On the Baltimore campus of Johns Hopkins, they met with Julian Stanley, a Georgia-­born psychologist who founded the Center for Talented Youth there. Tao was one of the most talented math students Stanley ever tested — at 8 years old, Tao scored a 760 on the math portion of the SAT — but Stanley urged the couple to keep taking things slow and give their son’s emotional and social skills time to develop.

Even at a relatively deliberate pace, by age 17, Tao had finished a master’s thesis (‘‘Convolution Operators Generated by Right-­Monogenic and Harmonic Kernels’’) and moved to Princeton University to start on his Ph.D. Tao’s application to the university included a letter from Paul Erdos, the revered Hungarian mathematician. ‘‘I am sure he will develop into a first-rate mathematician and perhaps into a really great one,’’ read Erdos’s brief, typewritten note. ‘‘I recommend him in the highest possible terms.’’ Yet on arrival, it was Tao, the teenage prodigy, who was intimidated. During Tao’s first year, Andrew Wiles, then a Princeton professor, announced that he proved Fermat’s Last Theorem, a legendary problem that had gone unsolved for more than three centuries. Tao’s fellow graduate students spoke eloquently about mathematical fields of which he had barely heard.

Tao became notorious for his nights haunting the graduate computer room to play the historical-­simulation game Civilization. (He now avoids computer games, he told me, because of what he calls a ‘‘completist streak’’ that makes it hard to stop playing.) At a local comic-book store, Tao met a circle of friends who played ‘‘Magic: The Gathering,’’ the intricate fantasy card game. This was Tao’s first real experience hanging out with people his age, but there was also an element, he admitted, of escaping the pressures of Princeton. Gifted children often avoid challenges at which they might not excel. Before Tao went to Princeton, his grades had flagged at Flinders. In a course on quantum physics, the instructor told the class that the final would include an essay on the history of the field. Tao, then 12, blew off studying, and when he sat down for the exam, he was stunned to discover that the essay would count for half the grade. ‘‘I remember crying,’’ Tao said, ‘‘and the proctor had to escort me out.’’ He failed.

At Princeton, crisis came in the form of the ‘‘generals,’’ a wide-­ranging, arduous oral examination administered by three professors. While other students spent months working through problem sets and giving one another mock exams, Tao settled on his usual test-prep strategy: last-­minute cramming. ‘‘I went in and very quickly got out of my depth,’’ he said. ‘‘They were asking questions which I had no ability to answer.’’ Immediately after, Tao sat with his adviser, Elias Stein, and felt that he had let him down. Tao wasn’t really trying, and the hardest part was yet to come.

The true work of the mathematician is not experienced until the later parts of graduate school, when the student is challenged to create knowledge in the form of a novel proof. It is common to fill page after page with an attempt, the seasons turning, only to arrive precisely where you began, empty-handed — or to realize that a subtle flaw of logic doomed the whole enterprise from its outset. The steady state of mathematical research is to be completely stuck. It is a process that Charles Fefferman of Princeton, himself a onetime math prodigy turned Fields medalist, likens to ‘‘playing chess with the devil.’’ The rules of the devil’s game are special, though: The devil is vastly superior at chess, but, Fefferman explained, you may take back as many moves as you like, and the devil may not. You play a first game, and, of course, ‘‘he crushes you.’’ So you take back moves and try something different, and he crushes you again, ‘‘in much the same way.’’ If you are sufficiently wily, you will eventually discover a move that forces the devil to shift strategy; you still lose, but — aha! — you have your first clue.

As a group, the people drawn to mathematics tend to value certainty and logic and a neatness of outcome, so this game becomes a special kind of torture. And yet this is what any ­would-be mathematician must summon the courage to face down: weeks, months, years on a problem that may or may not even be possible to unlock. You find yourself sitting in a room without doors or windows, and you can shout and carry on all you want, but no one is listening.

Within his field, Tao is best known for a proof about a remarkable set of numbers known as the primes. The primes are the whole numbers larger than 1 that can be divided evenly by only themselves and 1. Thus, the first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. The number 4 is not a prime because it divides evenly by 2; the number 9 fails because it can be divided by 3. Prime numbers are fundamental building blocks in mathematics. Like the chemical elements, they combine to form a universe. To a chemist, water is two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. Similarly, in mathematics, the number 12 is composed of two ‘‘atoms’’ of 2 and one ‘‘atom’’ of 3 (12 = 2 x 2 x 3).

The primes are elementary and, at the same time, mysterious. They are a result of simple logic, yet they seem to appear at random on the number line; you never know when the next one will occur. They are at once orderly and disorderly. They have been incorporated into mysticism and religious ritual and have inspired works of music and even an Italian novel, ‘‘The Solitude of Prime Numbers.’’ It is easy to see why mathematicians consider the primes to be one of the universe’s foundations. From counting, you can develop the concept of number, and then, quite naturally, the basic operations of arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. That is all you need to spot the primes — though, eerily, scientists have uncovered deep connections between primes and quantum mechanics that remain unexplained. Imagine that there is an advanced civilization of aliens around some distant star: They surely do not speak English, they may or may not have developed television, but we can be almost certain that their mathematicians have discovered the primes and puzzled over them.

Tao’s work is related to the twin-prime conjecture, which the French mathematician Alphonse de Polignac suggested in 1849. Go up the number line, circling the primes, and you may notice that sometimes a pair of primes is separated by just 2: 5 and 7, 11 and 13, 17 and 19. These are the ‘‘twin primes,’’ and as the journey along the number line continues, they occur less frequently: 2,237 and 2,239 are followed by 2,267 and 2,269; after 31,391 and 31,393, there isn’t another pair until you reach 31,511 and 31,513. Euclid devised a simple, beautiful proof showing that there is an infinite number of primes. But what of the twin primes? As far as you go on the number line, will there always be another set of twins? The conjecture has roundly defeated all attempts at proving it.

When mathematicians face a question they cannot answer, they sometimes devise a less stringent question, in the hope that solving it will provide insights. This is the path that Tao took in 2004, in collaboration with Ben Green of Oxford. Twins are two primes that are separated by exactly 2, but Green and Tao considered a looser definition, strings of primes separated by a constant, be it 2 or any other number. (For example, the primes 3, 7 and 11 are separated by the constant 4.) They sought to prove that no matter how long a string someone found, there would always be another longer string with a constant gap between its primes. That February, after some initial conversations, Green came to visit Tao at U.C.L.A., and in just two exhilarating months, they completed what is now known as the Green-Tao theorem. It could be a way point on the path to the twin-prime conjecture, and it forged deep connections between disparate areas of math, helping establish an interdisciplinary area called additive combinatorics. ‘‘It opened a lot of new directions in research,’’ says Izabella Laba, a University of British Columbia mathematician who has worked with Tao. ‘‘It gave a lot of people a lot of things to do.’’

This sort of collaboration has been a hallmark of Tao’s career. Most mathematicians tend to specialize, but Tao ranges widely, learning from others and then working with them to make discoveries. Markus Keel, a longtime collaborator and close friend, reaches to science fiction to explain Tao’s ability to rapidly digest and employ mathematical ideas: Seeing Tao in action, Keel told me, reminds him of the scene in ‘‘The Matrix’’ when Neo has martial arts downloaded into his brain and then, opening his eyes, declares, ‘‘I know kung fu.’’ The citation for Tao’s Fields Medal, awarded in 2006, is a litany of boundary hopping and notes particularly ‘‘beautiful work’’ on Horn’s conjecture, which Tao completed with a friend he had played foosball with in graduate school. It was a new area of mathematics for Tao, at a great remove from his known stamping grounds. ‘‘This is akin,’’ the citation read, ‘‘to a leading English-­language novelist suddenly producing the definitive Russian novel.’’

The Green-Tao theorem on primes was a similar collaboration. Green is a specialist in an area called number theory, and Tao originally trained in an area called harmonic analysis. Yet, as they told me, the proof depended on the insights of many other mathematicians. In the game of devil’s chess, players have no real hope if they haven’t studied the winning games of the masters. A proof establishes facts that can be used in subsequent proofs, but it also offers a set of moves and strategies that forced the devil to submit — a devious way to pin one of his pieces or shut down a counterattack, or an endgame move that sacrifices a bishop to gain a winning position. Just as a chess player might examine variations of the Ruy Lopez and King’s Indian Defense, a mathematician might study particularly clever applications of the Chinese remainder theorem or the sieve of Eratosthenes. The wise player has a vast repertoire to draw on, and the crafty player intuits the move that suits the moment.

For their work, Tao and Green salvaged a crucial bit from an earlier proof done by others, which had been discarded as incorrect, and aimed at a different goal. Other maneuvers came from masterful proofs by Timothy Gowers of England and Endre Szemeredi of Hungary. Their work, in turn, relied on contributions from Erdos, Klaus Roth and Frank Ramsey, an Englishman who died at age 26 in 1930, and on and on, into history. Ask mathematicians about their experience of the craft, and most will talk about an intense feeling of intellectual camaraderie. ‘‘A very central part of any mathematician’s life is this sense of connection to other minds, alive today and going back to Pythagoras,’’ said Steven Strogatz, a professor of mathematics at Cornell University. ‘‘We are having this conversation with each other going over the millennia.’’

The Green-Tao theorem caught the mathematical community by surprise, because that problem was thought to be many years from succumbing to proof. On the day I visited Tao, we ate lunch on the outdoor patio of the midcentury-­modern faculty center. Working on a modest plate of sushi, Tao told me that he and Green have continued to work around the margins of the twin-prime conjecture, as have others, with a lot of success recently. It is his sense, he said, that a proof is close at hand, more than a century and half after it was first articulated. ‘‘Maybe 10 years,’’ he said.

It was dinnertime when I headed to Tao’s home, a white-and-tan five-­bedroom on the western edge of campus. Tao was originally going to take his 12-year-old son, William, to a piano lesson, but William had received a callback for a Go-Gurt commercial. (He has already been in a Honda ad, in which he played the role of ‘‘boy who sleeps contentedly in the back seat.’’) While Tao’s wife, Laura, ferried William home, their daughter, Maddy, 4, finished her meal at an island in their spacious kitchen. She took a bite of her dessert — a cronut — and then clambered down her stool and began running from room to room, arms raised, squealing with delight.

Tao has emerged as one of the field’s great bridge-­builders. At the time of his Fields Medal, he had already made discoveries with more than 30 different collaborators. Since then, he has also become a prolific math blogger with a decidedly non-­Gaussian ebullience: He celebrates the work of others, shares favorite tricks, documents his progress and delights at any corrections that follow in the comments. He has organized cooperative online efforts to work on problems. ‘‘Terry is what a great 21st-­century mathematician looks like,’’ Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who has collaborated with Tao, told me. He is ‘‘part of a network, always communicating, always connecting what he is doing with what other people are doing.’’

In my visit with Tao, I noticed only one way in which he conforms to the math-­professor stereotype: an absent-mindedness that dates to his childhood. When he was a boy, he constantly lost books, even his book bag; he put clothes on backward or inside out, or he neglected to put on both socks. (This is why he wears Birkenstocks now. ‘‘One less step,’’ he explained.) As he showed me around the house, his gait was a bit awkward, as if, at some level, he was just not that interested in walking. I asked to see his office, and he pointed out an unremarkable chamber off a back hallway. He doesn’t get as much done there as he used to, he said; recently, he has been most productive on flights, when he has a block of hours away from email and all the people who hope for an audience with him.

After William arrived home, with Laura trailing behind, we sat down for dinner: pork chops in tomato sauce, a recipe taken from a handwritten collection, its notebook cover emblazoned with a teddy bear, that Laura received as a gift from Tao’s mother. William was gregarious. The Go-Gurt callback went well. (He eventually got the part.) William has some of his father’s natural facility for mathematics — as a sixth grader, he took an online course in precalculus — but his real passions at the moment are writing, particularly fantasy, and acting, particularly improv. He was also heavy into Minecraft, though he was annoyed because he was having trouble updating his hacks. Once, he said, he and a friend tried to hack math itself by proving that 1 equals 0, but then realized that it is forbidden to divide by 0. Tao rolled his eyes.

An effort to prove that 1 equals 0 is not likely to yield much fruit, it’s true, but the hacker’s mind-set can be extremely useful when doing math. Long ago, mathematicians invented a number that when multiplied by itself equals negative 1, an idea that seemed to break the basic rules of multiplication. It was so far outside what mathematicians were doing at the time that they called it ‘‘imaginary.’’ Yet imaginary numbers proved a powerful invention, and modern physics and engineering could not function without them.

Early encounters with math can be misleading. The subject seems to be about learning rules — how and when to apply ancient tricks to arrive at an answer. Four cookies remain in the cookie jar; the ball moves at 12.5 feet per second. Really, though, to be a mathematician is to experiment. Mathematical research is a fundamentally creative act. Lore has it that when David Hilbert, arguably the most influential mathematician of fin de siècle Europe, heard that a colleague had left to pursue fiction, he quipped: ‘‘He did not have enough imagination for mathematics.’’

Math traffics in abstractions — the idea, for example, that two apples and two oranges have something in common — but much of Tao’s work has a tangible aspect. He is drawn to waves of fluid or light, or things that can be counted, or geometries that you might hold in your mind. When a question does not initially appear in such a way, he strives to transform it. Early in his career, he struggled with a problem that involved waves rotating on top of one another. He wanted to come up with a moving coordinate system that would make things easier to see, something like a virtual Steadi­cam. So he lay down on the floor and rolled back and forth, trying to see it in his mind’s eye. ‘‘My aunt caught me doing this,’’ Tao told me, laughing, ‘‘and I couldn’t explain what I was doing.’’

Tao’s most recent work in exploding water began when a professor from Kazakhstan claimed to have completed a Navier-­Stokes proof. After looking at it, Tao felt sure that the proof was incorrect, but he decided to take this intuition a step further and show that any proof using the professor’s approach was sure to fail. While he was wading through the proof, asking colleagues for help in translating the explanatory text from the original Russian, he struck upon the notion of his imaginary, self-­replicating water contraption — drawing on ideas from engineering to make progress on a question in pure mathematics.

The feat is as much psychological as mathematical. Many people think that substantial progress on Navier-­Stokes may be impossible, and years ago, Tao told me, he wrote a blog post concurring with this view. Now he has some small bit of hope. The twin-prime conjecture had the same feel, a sense of breaking through the wall of intimidation that has scared off many aspirants. Outside the world of mathematics, both Navier-­Stokes and the twin-prime conjecture are described as problems. But for Tao and others in the field, they are more like opponents. Tao’s opponent has been known to taunt him, convincing him that he is overlooking the obvious, or to fight back, making quick escapes when none should be possible. Now the opponent appears to have revealed a weakness. But Tao said he has been here before, thinking he has found a way through the defenses, when in fact he was being led into an ambush. ‘‘You learn to get suspicious,’’ Tao said. ‘‘You learn to be on the lookout.’’

This is the thrill of it, and the dread. There is a shifting beneath the ground. The game is afoot.",REAL
When the Internet’s ‘Moderators’ Are Anything But,"Photo

Let us begin with a toast to the unsung hero of the social-media age: the moderator. Slayer of Internet trolls! Extinguisher of flame wars! Bulwark against race hatred and child pornography! The Internet as we know it could not exist without moderators, constantly pruning back the wild undergrowth of human nature that proliferates there. Nearly every major commercial site with user content is policed by human moderators. Some are unpaid volunteers who agree to enforce administrators’ rules; others are outsourced workers in the Philippines who flag dirty pictures posted to social media, or domestic employees who delete libelous comments. If you want to see what the Internet looks like without moderators … well, I’m not even going to tell you where to go, because we’d all be raided by the F.B.I. Let’s just say it’s immoderate.

Moderators are, by definition, forces for stability and civility in the raucous digital realm. Or that is, they’re supposed to be. Recently, the influential online message board Reddit was plunged into chaos by its army of volunteer moderators. It all started in early July, after Reddit abruptly fired an employee named Victoria Taylor. Taylor was well liked by Reddit’s moderators. She was the liaison between the company and its hugely popular Ask Me Anything section, where celebrities and other notable people answer questions from the Reddit community. Although unpaid, the moderators of Ask Me Anything approach their task more seriously than many people do their day jobs. Upset by Taylor’s disappearance, they shut down their entire forum, which gets millions of visits every day; this exploded into a sitewide protest, as dozens of other moderators locked down their forums as well. They wanted to give voice to their feeling, in one moderator’s words, that the company’s bosses ‘‘do not respect the work that is put in by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who maintain the communities of the 9,656 active subreddits,’’ as the individual forums are called.

The Reddit Revolt, as it came to be known, made headlines worldwide and made Reddit useless, at least temporarily. Much of the ire was aimed at Reddit’s interim chief executive, Ellen Pao. A petition demanding Pao’s resignation reached more than 200,000 signatures, and she was inundated with abuse on social media, some of it sexist and racist.

A week later, Pao resigned. Pao’s official reason was that Reddit’s board asked for a level of growth she felt she could not deliver. (Reddit recently raised $50 million in venture capital.) Nevertheless, the companywide disruption revealed the extreme power of the site’s moderators, and the unpredictability with which they wield it. At the height of the controversy, Reddit’s chairman and co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, pleaded with moderators to reactivate their subreddits. He sounded rather like a zookeeper, trying to coax back into its cage the angry lion who had just devoured a park guest. There is nothing moderate about holding the 10th-most-visited website in America hostage over a personnel change. How could a site’s moderators turn into its main source of volatility?

The answer springs straight from the dominant business model online, in which everyone is trying to capture enormous traffic while employing as few people as possible. At Reddit, which Condé Nast purchased in 2006, then spun off in 2011, more and more work has been outsourced to unpaid moderators as the site and its traffic have grown. Many of the most popular subreddits have been created by their moderators, who retain effective control over them. The idea of ‘‘moderating’’ presupposes an outside vision of what is and isn’t acceptable in a conversation. But when moderators set their own rules, with no incentive to conform to anyone else’s standard, they can look a lot less like custodians and a lot more like petty tyrants.

Today Reddit is governed, insofar as it’s governed at all, by a cabal of high-powered moderators who coordinate with administrators in private forums. The most influential of these forums, Modtalk, allows access only to moderators who oversee subreddits with a combined subscriber base of at least 25,000. A convoluted moderator culture has developed, full of intrigue and drama. Moderators are deposed after power struggles; the community is periodically wracked by allegations of payola and other schemes in which moderators game Reddit for personal gain.

Ted Cruz Is More of a Spider-Man Guy,"You are the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on space, and during a hearing, you asked NASA to focus on space exploration rather than climate change. Do you think there’s a big overlap between sci-fi nerds and people interested in policy? Well, I do think that readers of science fiction are interested and attracted to the future. And in many ways, politics is a battle for framing our future.

You’re also a fan of ‘‘Star Trek.’’ Do you prefer Captain Kirk or Captain Picard? Absolutely James Tiberius Kirk.

You seem to be good at anticipating what journalists are going to ask you. Do you think you would make a good journalist yourself? I don’t know. I certainly enjoy writing. Also, I spent many years as a Supreme Court litigator. There is a premium on brevity there because if you take even an extra sentence or two, the odds are high you’ll be cut off by a justice before you make your point.

Interesting, the man who is famous for filibustering claims that what he’s really good at is keeping his answers short. I’m just letting the irony of that comment flow right over my head.

If you were a journalist interviewing you, what would you ask? Who knows, I might well ask, ‘‘Kirk or Picard?’’ I’ve never been asked that before, and I actually have a strong opinion on it.

Well, that goes with being a Kirk person. It does indeed. Let me do a little psychoanalysis. If you look at ‘‘Star Trek: The Next Generation,’’ it basically split James T. Kirk into two people. Picard was Kirk’s rational side, and William Riker was his passionate side. I prefer a complete captain. To be effective, you need both heart and mind.

I thought your critique might go in a different direction, because ‘‘Next Generation’’ is more touchy-feely in its politics than the original. No doubt. The original ‘‘Star Trek’’ was grittier. Kirk is working class; Picard is an aristocrat. Kirk is a passionate fighter for justice; Picard is a cerebral philosopher. The original ‘‘Star Trek’’ pressed for racial equality, which was one of its best characteristics, but it did so without sermonizing.

Do you have a suspicion about whether Kirk would be a Democrat or a Republican? I think it is quite likely that Kirk is a Republican and Picard is a Democrat.

I think you and Kirk might have some personality traits in common. Well, thank you. I can affirmatively say that I have made out with far fewer space aliens.",REAL
The Unquiet Sky,"If aviation and militarism had a natural kinship at the beginning of the 20th century, they entered an uncanny union at the start of the 21st. Until 2004, unmanned aerial vehicles (U.A.V.s), or drones, as they’re popularly known, were eyes in the sky; like fantastic periscopes, they ushered in new forms of farsightedness. Then, in June of that year, an American U.A.V. fired a missile in South Waziristan. Two children were killed, as were several adults, one of them a mujahid called Nek Muhammad. More strikes followed the next year, and by 2008 the strikes were frequent and the death toll high, in the thousands. The results of the strikes followed the pattern established from the first one: Many of the people killed were innocent of wrongdoing.

In the public mind, drones had rightly come to be seen as ominous machines tracking their hapless victims, harbingers of sudden death. But drones are gaining other, no less accurate meanings. They can be any size, and they can resemble planes or helicopters, or both, or neither. Someday they could deliver our packages or even come to play a role in commuter transportation. But the key expansion in the public understanding of drones is in the realm of popular photography.

A view from a great height is irresistible. It is twinned with the ancient dream of flight. For millenniums, we have imaginatively soared above our material circumstances and dramatized this desire in tales from Icarus to Superman. Things look different from way up there. What was invisible before becomes visible: how one part of the landscape relates to another, how nature and infrastructure unfold. But with the acquisition of this panoptic view comes the loss of much that could be seen at close range. The face of the beloved is but one invisible detail among many.

When the French photographer Nadar leaned out of a hot-air balloon in 1858 and made a series of images of Paris, it was the beginning of a new age. Our eyes were carried aloft. Cities began to appear in photographic portraits that echoed maps, but with all the latest and truest information included. In 1860, James Wallace Black and Samuel Archer King made ‘‘Boston, as the Eagle and Wild Goose See It.’’ And in 1906, George R. Lawrence, deploying a complicated rig of kites, created enormous photographic panoramas of San Francisco right after the earthquake. Lawrence’s photographs gave the traumatized city a measure of its catastrophe. Three years later, Wilbur Wright piloted the plane from which the first moving picture was shot. In the century that followed, aerial photography was used in archaeology, advertising, surveillance and mapping. This precipitous rate of innovation also resulted in the technology that allows drones to fix their stares on those we deem enemies. And, higher up, satellites and geolocating devices have transformed our sense of the world itself.",REAL
The Sweetness of Mexico,"Photo

I don’t know that I’ve ever seen an Italian restaurant with an Aztec name, so I looked twice at Xochil Pizzeria, the O sporting a floppy chef’s hat, to make sure I’d read the sign correctly. I chuckled, turning to say something about it to Fany Gerson, but then realized that ‘‘Fany Gerson’’ might not be the most probable name for a Mexican woman, either.

Gerson, who grew up in Mexico City, a great-granddaughter of immigrants from Russia, was leading me down Fifth Avenue in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, which has the second-largest pocket of Mexican immigrants in New York. In 90-degree heat, we stepped syrupy-slow past some of her favorite tortas and the ruches of a quinceañera dress store. We were looking for paletas, Mexican fruit-ice pops. Gerson owns La Newyorkina, a tiny company that makes fantastic ones — gently sweet, with intense flavors and a biteable texture — and we were trawling the neighborhood to inspire a new flavor we could make together. We were distracted for a moment by two women on the street selling gorditas, fried masa cakes split and stuffed with cheese, but turned up little paleta action aside from a few frostbitten specimens buried in bodega freezers, colored in ways that were never nature’s plan.

‘‘Is it weird that we’re not having any luck?’’ I asked her. I’d always heard that Mexicans loved their paletas. (Do a search for ‘‘Tocumbo paleta monument,’’ and you’ll see what I mean.)

She replied, ‘‘Well, in Mexico City, you’d find a paleteria in pretty much any popular neighborhood.’’ She described them — the rows and rows of pops, their mango and chile and blackberry hues lighting up the stores in a patchwork rainbow, still mostly made with real, vibrantly flavored fruit. But here, I guess, paletas get a little lost in the shuffle of hardworking immigrant culture — the tough math of what counts as a necessity.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Although necessity was, in a sense, why Gerson opened her own paleta business. Seven years ago, while she was in Mexico researching a cookbook of the country’s pastry, Gerson opened her email to find a message from her husband: He wanted a divorce. She put her hands in flour and sugar and tried to work the pain out, avoiding the quiet hours of night. When she returned to New York City, where she has lived for 15 years, opening a business carried a sense of vital purpose. ‘‘I know it sounds cheesy,’’ she said, ‘‘But I needed to keep sharing the sweetness of Mexico.’’ And that meant sharing that part of the culture in every sense — not just paletas, but the friendliness, the sight of a shop with its multicolored awning and the high promise of sweet and cold on a hot day.

For now, that shop is still a bit of a dream; she mostly sells through street carts. So when I asked her if she could imagine her shop in this neighborhood, brightening the block, I expected her to light up.",REAL
Should I Ask My Secretary to Fix Her Teeth?,"Photo

I have a small law practice with several employees. My secretary, who is the face of the firm to every client or prospective client who walks through the door, fell last December and knocked out eight front teeth. Since then she has not had them replaced or had dentures made. She comes to work with no front teeth, which is not the face I want put forward. She has health and dental insurance through my office, but she says she’s too nervous about surgery and hates going to the dentist, so she’s not going to do anything. Can I require her to fix her teeth or get dentures as a condition of continued employment? NAME WITHHELD, NEW YORK

Kwame Anthony Appiah: One possibility is that when she says she’s nervous about surgery, what she means is she has a pathological fear, not just that she doesn’t want to do it. Or she might be thinking: There are deductibles on these things, they’re quite expensive, I don’t have the money right now. Medical and dental insurance doesn’t mean that she’s not going to have to pay anything. So the right way into this is to have a conversation with her in which you discuss fully what all the issues are. But in the end her job is, as you say, to be the face of your firm, and if you think after discussing it with her that she can’t do that job properly, that she’s going to either turn people away or lead people to have less respect for your legal capacity and so on, then this is something that you can reasonably ask her to do. But only after you’ve had these fuller discussions. It’s one thing to say that she’s the face of your business and it’s not the face you want to put forward; it’s another thing to say that she’s actually damaging your business.

Amy Bloom: We so often come to this point — start with a full and frank conversation with the other person. Find out what the circumstances are. A $500 deductible might still be very hard to afford. You should really think about how much surprise and discomfort she is causing your clients. Maybe you’re assuming she is, and maybe she isn’t. I will also say eight is a lot of missing teeth, and I don’t find it hard to imagine that that would make her more difficult to understand. If she refuses to do anything about it and there is no other position for her in the office, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to say this isn’t going to work out.

Kenji Yoshino: Legally, the letter writer could terminate the employee because this situation as described doesn’t touch on any protected classification, like disability. But we’re talking about ethics rather than the law. Would either of you say that it’s ethical to make it a condition of her employment that she lose weight? She’s not deprived of her capacity to interact with the public simply because she lacks front teeth.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Bloom: I disagree. If your job is to greet and speak to people, missing eight teeth does hamper your ability to be the face and also the voice. It’s harder to understand people. Being very overweight doesn’t affect the ability to greet people when they come in the door, to ask them what they’re there for and to engage them in conversation.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: New Balance 990s,"Photo

The first time I even considered buying a pair of New Balances, I was 27, bronzed and lean, standing in a frigid sporting-goods store in Biloxi, Miss., having walked there from New York. The year was 2007. Four months earlier, I had experienced that spiritual crisis stereotypical of young people — the one in which you can’t seem to square the scope of your ambitions with the limits of your daily life, which in my case was spent in a Midtown Manhattan cubicle. So I packed a bag and said goodbye to everyone I loved, including my wife, who was ecstatic to see me go.

My plan was simple, even if its motivations remain hard to articulate. I would walk 30 miles a day, every day, until I made it to New Orleans. One day, halfway down the Jersey Shore, I tried walking as far as I could, until the sky turned black and one of my toenails did, too. Another night, I made camp on an abandoned floating dock I found washed up on a small island. Later, as the surf heaved beneath me, I realized, much too late, that the dock was adrift. When the tide took me back in, I admired the sunrise, laced up my cheap shoes and walked the final miles to Cape May. From there, I boarded a ferry to Delaware. A few miles into Virginia, I felt the first of many blisters.

I suppose looks prevented me from buying New Balances before my walk. There’s something aggressively earnest about them. New Balance initially made only arch supports, and slowly moved into manufacturing entire shoes. In 1982, the company debuted a new model that would go on to become one of its most popular: the 990. An early advertisement featured a picture of a clunky gray sneaker alongside copy that declared, semimodestly, ‘‘On a scale of 1,000, this shoe is a 990.’’

It was the United States market’s first hundred-dollar athletic shoe and, perhaps owing to the company’s inside-out approach to shoemaking, was designed in a style you might call medical grade. Both the price and aesthetic seemed to say: ‘‘I find L.L. Bean very fashionable and have no need to rent out the beach house when I am not using it.’’ They became, arguably, the least memorable part of Steve Jobs’s uniform.

As a young urbanite, I rarely had any reason to think about shoes in utilitarian terms. But then, all of a sudden, I was a guy walking to Louisiana. That first inexpensive pair of running shoes gave out somewhere in the Carolinas. I bought a second pair, and with these I limped across the Florida panhandle. By that time I had pounded my feet so profoundly that my shoe size had actually increased. Weeks later, I found myself in that shopping mall in coastal Mississippi, ready for something better.",REAL
Charmed,"Why? Because the evil eye is serious business. If your husband went from adoring you to neglecting you, it was the evil eye that caused it. If your healthy child suddenly landed in the hospital, it was the evil eye. If you wore a white linen dress and ended up with an ugly green stain before lunch, it was the evil eye.

Of course it doesn’t make sense. But then again, how much about personal disaster makes any sense at all? In the face of unexpected calamity, we tend to say, it started out as just an ordinary day! Well, yes, it started out as just an ordinary day, until an envious neighbor evil-eyed you.

That, at least, is what my grandmother believed. She wore a khamsa all the time. Years ago, when I was about to sit for my ninth-grade examinations, she insisted that I wear one, too. These exams were important: They would determine not only whether I would graduate from middle school but also whether I would study science or literature in high school, and even whether I could apply to certain colleges later. When my grandmother handed me the necklace, I smiled, barely suppressing my condescension. I was 14; I knew everything. ‘‘It’s a silly superstition,’’ I said.

She fixed her milky eyes upon me. Her chin was marked with tattoos, and her hands were perpetually hennaed. She didn’t know how to read or write, but she knew which leaves to brew if I caught a cold, which seeds could restore my appetite, which concoction could clear my skin. It was knowledge passed on to her by her foremothers, women who had little to rely on in the world but themselves. ‘‘Laila,’’ she said. ‘‘Put it on.’’

No one worried more about me than she did. So I put the khamsa on to make her happy. I passed my exams and went on to high school and college and graduate school. Over the years, my head filled with other kinds of knowledge, handed down to me in the form of books, a wealth of logic and reason and certainties. They provided me with explanations for many things, though not for the mysteries of luck.

Once, rushing for an elevator, I called for the man inside to hold it. He did. Now he is my husband. Good luck, you might say. Some years ago, my younger brother was admitted to a hospital, complaining of back pain. Kidney failure. Bad luck.

I could not see a reason that fortune and misfortune struck with such randomness. Eventually, the distance between my grandmother’s world and mine, a distance I had thought unbridgeable, began to shrink. What once seemed a foolish superstition became something else: the expression of a human desire to somehow tilt the odds in your favor. I took to wearing a khamsa. The silver amulet rests close to my heart, as if my grandmother’s hand were reaching back across time to touch me.

My daughter uncoiled the necklace I had placed in her palm and held it aloft. ‘‘Protect me from what?’’ she asked.

‘‘The evil eye.’’

‘‘I don’t believe in that stuff.’’

‘‘Well, it looks great on you.’’

Then the moment I have dreaded since I gave birth to her arrived: She rolled her eyes. ‘‘O.K. Whatever.’’

We went to the school recital. I sat in the second row and watched as my daughter filed onto the stage with her classmates. The conductor came in, and the audience settled into a reverent silence. The first notes of Zach Wallmark’s ‘‘Rue de Royal’’ filled the auditorium. Then it was the first four movements of Grieg’s ‘‘Peer Gynt,’’ and for a finale a selection from ‘‘Phantom of the Opera.’’ Not a single misstep. A phenomenal success. See?",REAL
How to Tell a Joke,"Photo

‘‘People should not be able to telegraph where a joke’s going,’’ says Hari Konda­bolu, a stand-up comic from Queens. The only way to guarantee surprise is to create original material. Street jokes — the kind you read in a book or hear at summer camp and tell with the preface ‘‘Want to hear a joke?’’ — are almost never funny, Kondabolu says. They also often involve animals, inexplicably. (If you must go that route, ducks make for the funniest animal jokes, according to a global survey done by scientists at the University of Hertfordshire.) His routines playfully take on more serious topics like race and gender.

Being a professional funny man is hard, so treat every joke as ‘‘a work in progress,’’ says Kondabolu, who has a master’s degree from the London School of Economics and used to be a correspondent for ‘‘Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell,’’ the TV comedy produced by Chris Rock. Tell the same wisecrack over and over for weeks, tweaking it slightly as you go in order to figure out the right timing and phrasing. Even though a new joke might be a result of reams of notes on potentially funny things and months of reciting punch lines alone in front of the mirror, the delivery should feel spontaneous. ‘‘You want to make it sound like this is stuff you just made up on the spot,’’ Konda­bolu says. Slow down. Don’t get nervous and start talking faster just because people haven’t laughed for a minute or two. ‘‘Silence is the hardest part — try not to be afraid of it.’’

Some jokes are not salvageable and die along the way, while others emerge, finally, to laughter. Whether you’re performing for a few friends over drinks or in front of hundreds of strangers at a packed comedy club, when your punch line lands, Kondabolu says, your audience should simultaneously be laughing and asking themselves, ‘‘How did he do that?’’

You can be funny in virtual forums — say, on Twitter — and quantify a joke’s value in favorites, likes or retweets. But the only real metric that matters to a joke-teller ought to be laughter in his or her presence. ‘‘If people aren’t laughing, then it’s slam poetry,’’ Kondabolu says, ‘‘and that’s not what you’re trying to do.’’",REAL

soaring, pushing the sky to the horizon

terrified, clinging to his thigh, its deathspin

slowing as it coptered softly down and he snatched it

from the air. How you loved that rush of fear,



both wanting and not wanting him to feel how hard

you clung, just the same as when he’d float you

weightless across the pond while waves slapped



and shushed and bickered, his breath loud in your ear ...

and after he dried you off, he’d lift you onto his shoulders

and help you shove your head through a hole in the sky.",REAL

RE: BOGOTÁ TWINS

Susan Dominus’s article — all 11,000 words of it — about two sets of identical twins who were accidentally separated soon after birth, raised as two sets of fraternal twins, then reunited when they were in their 20s, intrigued readers. (In his rounds on morning news programs, the magazine’s editor in chief, Jake Silverstein, used visual aids — two lemons and two limes — to explain the story.)

Ethics dictates that we can’t do the kind of experiments on humans that we can on flies and cows: separating individuals at birth and seeing how much difference in behavior and appearance can be created by rearing siblings (identical or fraternal) in different environments. Data so far show that a surprisingly large amount of variation in human behavior rests on variation in genes, but these studies aren’t perfect. Still, they should give pause to those who believe (often based on political ideology) that genes don’t play much of a role in the diversity of behavior among individuals in the human population. Jerry A. Coyne, in a post on his blog, Why Evolution Is True

Beautifully written account of an arduous topic with a clash between human interest and scientific research at its best. I would, however, like to add a couple of observations as a Colombian who personally met all four twins, for the benefit of the readers who are feeling that William was wronged by being brought up in the rural countryside.

I wish I had the upbringing and the life lessons that William and Wilber experienced. I could then possibly have acquired values like humility, pride, honesty, solidarity and acceptance of the things that are really worthwhile in life. I would trade all my New York City prestige and my acute technical skills for an ounce of human values these fellows demonstrate. William and Wilber (and their family) have invited Jorge and Carlos to partake of the true essence of family, and likewise they have impacted the lives of everyone who has had the good fortune of meeting them! Guys, use your fame to show the world what a true Colombian is made of. Alberto Orjuela, Bogotá, Colombia

I probably wasn’t the only one who postulated that Hollywood would be champing at the bit to turn the captivating story of ‘‘The Mixed-­Up Brothers of Bogotá’’ into a blockbuster movie about the fantastical tale of two sets of twins unknowingly ripped apart and raised in thoroughly diametrical environments. The yarn would be overflowing with zany mishaps, unexpected twists, utter confusion and a decisive climatic reunion.

Then I remembered that such a movie has already been made. ‘‘Big Business’’ starred the comedic geniuses known as Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin, both playing two sets of identical twins. ‘‘Big Business’’ was released in 1988 — the same year William, Jorge, Wilber and Carlos were conceived and born. Mind blown. Twofold. Qraig de Groot, Jersey City

This moving story, with many implications for the brothers featured in the article, as well as for their families, has rightly made it onto the most emailed list. Nevertheless, more credit should have been given to the original narrative, ‘‘Vidas Cruzadas,’’ that ran on Oct. 26, 2014, on the Colombian TV program ‘‘Séptimo Día.’’ María-Inés Lagos, Charlottesville, Va., posted on nytimes.com

What’s not often considered in studies of identical twins reared apart is whether identical twins reared together actually grow up to have more differences from each other than they might have had if they had been reared apart but in very similar circumstances or as an only child. Twins raised together need to find some interests or achievements that are unique to them and that distinguish them from their twin. Twins raised apart or alone would have much less motivation to be different from ‘‘themselves’’ in order to be noticed and praised, and thus they would be less driven to pick interests or modes of expression that differ from their twin’s and perhaps from their own genetically driven inclinations. You could speculate that epigenetic effects may also influence or even develop from these differing behaviors and the natural desire of an identical twin to be somewhat less than completely identical in the eyes of the rest of the world. raflei00, posted on nytimes.com",REAL
Re-Re-Re-Reintroducing Hillary Clinton,"The starkness of this language jumped out at me — “stalks” and, especially, “dehumanized,” a term we associate with subjects of nefarious experiments or victims of unspeakable abuse. They betrayed an ambivalence toward the unnatural habitat that Clinton had chosen for her life and toward the onslaught that she would subject herself to as soon as she started running again.

Leading up to this campaign, Clinton made noises about maybe taking a less cautious approach. ‘‘It does seem to me that you’re pretty free to speak your mind these days,’’ her friend and former speechwriter Lissa Muscatine observed during a conversation onstage at George Washington University in June of last year, while Clinton was promoting her latest midcareer memoir, ‘‘Hard Choices.’’ Clinton told Muscatine: ‘‘Maybe it’s because I’m totally done with being really careful about what I’m going to say. It just gets too exhausting and frustrating.’’

She began her campaign in April by hopping into a decked-out campaign van, christened Scooby, and bolting for Iowa. Pretty much everyone I talked to on her campaign made a point of mentioning that this road trip was the candidate’s idea. It was important that I knew that. But there was a tentative feel to the self-conscious joy ride. At one point, Scooby stopped at a Chipotle in Ohio, which resulted in the most scrutinized fast-food order in history (a kind of Watergate for burrito bowls). The drop-by yielded a memorable still of the candidate, frozen on a security camera and ordering alone — a testimonial to public life in all its hyperdissected isolation.

From the outset of the campaign, any hope that Clinton might unveil a more freewheeling style in keeping with the more unplugged sensibilities of today’s political and media culture lasted for all of, well, never. Signs of apparent spontaneity and whimsy have been nonexistent — she has been largely steadfast in avoiding interviews, with a campaign team that can convey a heavy-handed preoccupation with control. Conversations I have had with officials tend to be vigilantly ground-ruled. In June, I visited Clinton’s Brooklyn Heights headquarters to interview Robby Mook, her 35-year-old campaign manager. The meeting had been arranged through Jesse Ferguson, a campaign press minder, who in advance of my arrival sent me an email that said the following: ‘‘The ground rules we’ve had with others in our office is that the office itself is OTR,’’ meaning off the record. ‘‘I don’t want to get into a contest of people tweeting pic from our office to show they were there.’’

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

I wrote back that I was not abiding by any ‘‘office is off the record’’ provisions and that it was not clear to me how you could declare a 40,000-square-foot space off the record. I did agree not to tweet.

Ferguson came back asking me if I would ‘‘embargo’’ anything that I saw in the office until the time my article was published. He made it sound as if I were gaining access to the Situation Room. ‘‘Regardless when the story runs,’’ he wrote, it ‘‘still means you’re the first reporter who can report anything from the office.’’

(Now I feel obligated to reveal something interesting from the office, which basically resembled a large insurance company in its expanse of cubicles. Here’s something: I spotted Reggie Love, President Obama’s semifamous ‘‘body man,’’ meeting with someone in a conference room. He says he was visiting a friend.)

Out on the trail, the tired stare-downs — Clinton versus press mobs — keep playing out in the same joyless collisions between solipsistic meteors in a contained galaxy. In late May, I went to watch Clinton speak at a microbrewery in Hampton, N.H. She arrived just before noon in Scooby, and the owners of the brewery led her on a tour. Clinton asked if she could hold some of the grain in her hands, and generally performed the practiced Kabuki of the candidate looking interested on a factory tour. ‘‘How long is the process?’’ she asked. ‘‘Where does the barley come from?’’

A Week in the Life of Hillary Seven days in the Clinton campaign consists of a few scheduled events (mainly fund-raisers) and a full slate of absurdity. By Gillian Brassil MONDAY, JUNE 29 Fund-raiser at the home of Martin Sosnoff, a New York money manager. Miniconcert with Jon Bon Jovi in Red Bank, N.J. Bon Jovi controversy! Politico reports that Chris Christie used his song ‘‘Who Says You Can’t Go Home’’ for his presidential announcement. The campaign puts a new ‘‘summer’’ section on its online store. Now on offer: ‘‘Chillary Clinton’’ beer cozies and ‘‘Grillary Clinton’’ aprons. TUESDAY, JUNE 30 DJ Cassidy and his 24-karat-gold mike perform at Terminal 5 in New York. Olivia Wilde and Zach Braff post to Instagram from the event. (Zach: “Finally started dating again. #ChillingWithBae”) State Department releases Clinton emails, including: Clinton complains of fax trouble to her assistant Huma Abedin: ‘‘I thought it was supposed to be off hook to work?’’ And also: ‘‘Can you contact your protocol friend in China and ask him if I could get photos of the carpets of the rooms I met in w POTUS during the recent trip? I love their designs.’’ Mother Jones: Clinton is basically Selina Meyer from ‘‘Veep.’’ SUBJECT LINE: Apples ‘‘Will we receive them this fall? How can I buy some for personal use?’’ Elle Magazine gets po­liti­cal and covers Clinton’s new Pinterest page: ‘‘Hillary Clinton is offering more than just principles and pantsuits.’’ WEDNESDAY, JULY 1 Fund-raiser at Kenneth Cole’s home in Purchase, N.Y. Fund-raising milestone: The campaign announces $45 million haul for first quarter — a record. Time magazine reports on Kim Kardashian’s support for Hillary as the first woman president.

The campaign was only weeks old at that point, but the press horde had already achieved midseason peevishness. A few days before the brewery visit in New Hampshire, Ed Henry of Fox News interrupted a round table that Clinton was hosting in Cedar Falls, Iowa, by yelling out, ‘‘Secretary Clinton, will you take questions from the media as well?’’ Henry is a cheerful, toothy-grinned character — armed with ‘‘tough questions’’ and killer pocket squares — who clearly relishes his role as a soldier for democracy on America’s highest-rated cable news network. He protested that Clinton had not answered anything from the press in a month. She was noncommittal in her response and not a bit sarcastic: ‘‘I will put it on my list for due consideration.’’ Finally, Clinton approached the hungry cluster. ‘‘Tell me something I don’t know,’’ she said in a greeting that I took as a somewhat passive-aggressive recognition that she had seen this dance so many times before: same as it ever was, only this time with Twitter.

‘‘What makes you so special,’’ a voice boomed out, ‘‘that you don’t have to answer the press’s questions every day?’’ In an almost serene voice, Clinton broke into dorm proctor mode and urged the overcaffeinated kids to ‘‘bring some order out of this, bring some order.’’ The whole spectacle yielded nothing of consequence, though it did provide Henry with a dubious bragging right. ‘‘The reason she had a news conference,’’ he said later in his report on Fox News, ‘‘is because I started shouting questions.’’

Here at the brewery a few days later, a similar scene transpired. A clutch of about 100 media types waited for Clinton next to boxes of beer stacked several feet high. She walked over and was promptly swallowed up into a familiar scrum of leaned-in torsos, outstretched tape recorders, jostling cameras and furry boom mikes.

‘‘SECRETARY CLINTON, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON’T THINK YOU’RE TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT BENGHAZI.’’

‘‘WHAT ABOUT THE EMAILS?’’

I was standing just behind Clinton for this display, which afforded me the same vantage point she had. It was a rare perspective, to look up into a mob of inquisitors staring and smirking back. She has been in the middle of so many thousands of these, for so many years now, that the layers of déjà vu — especially here in New Hampshire — probably don’t even register. This is abjectly normal for her. But you can understand how it could be terrifying to the uninitiated. It helps explain why people would ask Clinton, as they do all the time, how she has the stomach for another one of these. Where does the barley come from?

I couldn’t see Clinton’s face or make out anything she was saying. Every 30 seconds or so brought a new garble of desperate cross-screams. After a few minutes Clinton turned to go, walking toward a restricted area a few feet away. She ignored more shouts, thanked everyone and then, wearing a small and determined grin, slipped into a moving fortress of men with earpieces.

‘‘You know,’’ I heard her saying to the person she was walking with on the other side of a curtain, ‘‘these shoes are a little clunky.’’

Clinton’s ‘‘scars’’ and resiliency are clearly a point of defiant pride. Being someone who perseveres (in her campaigns, in her marriage, in her political fights) has always been central to her identity. She talked a lot about this late in the 2008 primaries, after it was clear that Obama would be the nominee and fellow Democrats were urging her to quit. Clinton seemed to settle at that point on a theme of toughness — the same ‘‘fighter’’ theme that the campaign keeps hammering home today.

A Week in the Life of Hillary THURSDAY, JULY 2 Three separate fund-raisers not at the homes of famous people. Breitbart.com reports that it has been two weeks since Clinton last answered a question from the press. The press grumbles. Jimmy Kimmel on Clinton’s ‘‘Apples’’ email: ‘‘This has to be code for pot, right? I hope Hillary got good premium-quality apples to bake with. Wouldn’t it be great if we found out Hillary Clinton was a stoner? It would explain the pantsuits.’’ FRIDAY, JULY 3 Fund-raiser at the New Hampshire home of the yogurt mogul Gary Hirshberg. Clinton answers to the press: Her favorite flavor of ice cream? ‘‘I like nearly everything.’’ Republicans grumble that Obama’s announcement of labor reform in Wisconsin is meant to improve Hillary’s chances against Scott Walker. The Clinton campaign does not engage. SATURDAY, JULY 4 Fourth of July Parade, Gorham, N.H. Clinton quoted: ‘‘I love parades. I love walking in parades.’’ Parade controversy! Aides use a rope to usher the press along the parade route. Drudge Report: ‘‘HUMALIATION: PRESS LASSOED BY CLINTON AIDES AT EVENT’’ Viral publicity coup: A comment from Clinton on a Humans of New York post about a young gay boy worried about his future gets 33,000 likes in 24 hours: ‘‘Prediction from a grown-up: Your future is going to be

amazing.’’ SUNDAY, JULY 5 A day of much-deserved fund-raising rest. Reports of Bernie Sanders’ gaining in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. Clinton isn’t worried: ‘‘I take a back seat to no one when you look at my record of standing up and fighting for progressive values.’’ Sunday paper: The New York Times runs article on selfies with candidates — lead image is Clinton.

That was the gist, stretched over 45 minutes, of her kickoff speech on Roosevelt Island in New York in June. The inaugural rally was supposed to take place in May, but the campaign put it off. The drafting of her address was described to me as a free-for-all, if not a fiasco. Numerous co-authors from inside and outside the campaign were called in from the various shadow governments of Hillarylands past and present. There were alums from the Bill Clinton White House and the Hillary Clinton State Department (Lissa Muscatine was enlisted) and veterans of Obama World (the president’s former speechwriter Jon Favreau was asked to pitch in), along with a far-flung network of friends and advisers and satellites. Clinton was deeply involved in collating the policies and issues she would touch on, but has never been known for soaring rhetoric — or, for that matter, inspirational slogans. ‘‘She tends to resist starting out with a message and working back to a program,’’ said John Podesta, a longtime friend and adviser who is serving as chairman of the campaign. Podesta told me that Clinton prefers to hone her policy positions and develop her program, and let the message flow from there.

No one would expect Clinton to meet her husband’s impossible standard as communicator, or Obama’s as speech-giver, but the kickoff address came off more as a hodgepodge than a call to action. It also had an oddly throwback feel, evoking New Deal liberalism (at Roosevelt Island) and traditional Democratic themes, and was delivered by someone who has been part of our political scenery for a quarter-century. ‘‘America can’t succeed unless you succeed,’’ Clinton said in the speech’s banner passage. ‘‘That’s why I’m running for president of the United States.’’ (About that line, The Atlantic’s Molly Ball wrote: ‘‘Clinton’s entire candidacy, it seemed, was built around a non sequitur.’’)

Some commentators remarked that the speech, with a workmanlike, laundry-list feel, was reminiscent of a State of the Union address. That comparison, when applied to a speech by a nonpresident, suggests a sense of inevitability that no campaign wants to project. But the Clinton team has a strong notion of its advantages — that the candidate, whose election would be historic, is an overwhelming front-runner. Her top challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, has been drawing impressive crowds and cash, but his eventual support probably has the ceiling you would expect from a 73-year-old avowed socialist. Republicans, for their part, are in the throes of a primary battle royale (14 candidates and counting) that is laying bare the many ideological fissures within the party; whoever prevails will confront a continuing demographic shift in favor of voters likely to opt for Democratic nominees (as they have, in terms of the popular vote, in five of the last six national elections).

Clinton’s enterprise has a grind-it-out quality reminiscent of Obama’s re-election strategy of 2012: cover your base, attack often. Her team will emphasize data, targeting and field operations — all specialties Mook sharpened as a wunderkind state director for Clinton in 2008 and in subsequent statewide and congressional races. Ground troops will identify supporters and make sure they vote, without giving much thought to persuading swing voters. In nearly every campaign event, the candidate catalogs all the fights she has waged on their ‘‘everyday American’’ behalf. That’s as close as there comes to a big idea in this expedition. To fight is a skill, and it creates a spectacle, but it hardly constitutes a vision. Nor is it a particularly fresh theme for Democratic presidential candidates, who have been trumpeting their ‘‘I’ll fight for you’’ credentials for decades (the future lobbyist Richard Gephardt used to punctuate his labor-heavy rallies with an impassioned ‘‘It’s your fight too!’’).

Clinton often says at her events that her campaign is ‘‘not about me.’’ All politicians say that (even though, of course, it is about them). But she is right in that she stands for bigger things, not least among them the goal of electing a woman as president. Her sex gives the campaign a built-in point of connection, and compared with what she did in 2008, Clinton has not hesitated to emphasize the factor known euphemistically as ‘‘the historic nature of her candidacy.’’

‘‘I love that she is a woman — that’s a huge deal for me,’’ Mary Lee Sargent, a retired community-college professor from Bow, N.H., told me. I met Sargent at a rally Clinton held a few days after her kickoff event, at an orchard near Concord. Sargent said she was no great Hillary fan. ‘‘I have no illusion that she would change Washington,’’ she told me, adding that she would vote for Sanders in the primary but Clinton in the general election. It would be great, she reiterated, ‘‘to have a woman in there.’’

There are plainly concerns within the Hillary camp about an ‘‘enthusiasm gap,’’ especially given the recent crowds, money and attention Sanders has been drawing. When I asked Mook about the challenge of keeping Clinton supporters excited, given how familiar the candidate is and the glide path she appears to have to the nomination, he became defensive. ‘‘I take issue with the excitement question,’’ he told me, noting that they have ‘‘more social media activity than any other candidate.’’ He added, again, ‘‘I take issue with the premise of your question.’’

Mook projects a confidence belying his age and the stresses of his job. As the campaign manager, he sits in the bull’s-eye within the many circles of insanity that ring Planet Clintonia. (Actually, Mook does not sit, as his office is equipped with a standing desk.) What impressed me was how he dispatched my question about reconciling the divide between the candidate’s cautious persona and the private ‘‘Hillary I know’’ that her disciples swear by. ‘‘What I worry about is us getting up in our heads too much and trying to manufacture one thing or another,’’ he told me. ‘‘My priority is letting her take her time to get out there, let the voters see who she is, rather than some Wizard of Oz.’’",REAL
You Just Got Out of Prison. Now What?,"Eventually, Dale Hammock appeared. Hammock was 65, white, his head shaved completely bald, both arms wrapped in black tattoos. He wore sweat shorts, a white T-shirt, canvas slip-ons and white socks pulled up near his knees. All his clothes were bright and brand-new. As he approached Carlos and Roby, he thrust his chest toward them as far as it would go. Inside, this might have signaled strength and authority, but out here, it looked bizarre, as if he had some kind of back deformity.

Carlos shouted, ‘‘Welcome home, Mr. Hammock!’’ Roby shouted, ‘‘How are you feeling, Mr. Hammock?’’ They introduced themselves and hurried to collect his few possessions — a brown paper bag and a pair of work boots — moving as if they’d done this exchange dozens of times, which they had, while Hammock stood between them, looking stunned.

Carlos handed Hammock the key and asked if he wanted to pop the trunk. But the key wasn’t a key; it was a button. After squinting at it for a second, Hammock handed it back and said, ‘‘I wouldn’t know what to do with that.’’

He’d been in prison for 21 years.

Hammock was sent away in 1994, at a time when stiff sentencing reforms around the country were piling more people into prison for longer amounts of time. These included California’s ‘‘three-strikes law,’’ which took effect just months before Hammock was arrested. The law imposed life sentences for almost any crime if the offender had two previous ‘‘serious’’ or ‘‘violent’’ convictions. (The definitions of ‘‘serious’’ and ‘‘violent’’ in California’s penal code are broad; attempting to steal a bicycle from someone’s garage is ‘‘serious.’’) Similar laws proliferated in other states and in the 1994 federal crime bill, becoming signatures of that decade’s tough-on-crime policies and helping to catapult the country into the modern era of mass incarceration. But as the criminologist Jeremy Travis, then head of the Justice Department’s research agency, later pointed out, America had failed to recognize the ‘‘iron law of imprisonment’’: Each of the 2.4 million people we’ve locked up, if he or she doesn’t die in prison, will one day come out.

It wasn’t until the mid-2000s that this looming ‘‘prisoner re-entry crisis’’ became a fixation of sociologists and policy makers, generating a torrent of research, government programs, task forces, nonprofit initiatives and conferences now known as the ‘‘re-entry movement.’’ The movement tends to focus on solving structural problems, like providing housing, job training or drug treatment, but easily loses sight of the profound disorientation of the actual people being released. Often, the psychological turbulence of those first days or weeks is so debilitating that recently incarcerated people can’t even navigate public transportation; they’re too frightened of crowds, too intimidated or mystified by the transit cards that have replaced cash and tokens. In a recent study, the Harvard sociologist Bruce Western describes a woman who ‘‘frequently forgot to eat breakfast or lunch for several months because she was used to being called to meals in prison.’’ I met one man who explained that, after serving 15 years, he found himself convinced that parked cars would somehow switch on and run him over. So many years inside can leave people vulnerable in almost incomprehensibly idiosyncratic ways, sometimes bordering on helplessness: ‘‘Like that little bird, getting his wings’’ is how one man described himself on Day 1. Many spill out of prison in no condition to take advantage of the helpful bureaucracies the re-entry movement has been busily putting in place.

This became clear in 2012, after California voted to overhaul its three-strikes law and a criminal-justice group at Stanford Law School, the Stanford Three Strikes Project, started filing petitions to have roughly 3,000 prisoners serving life sentences set free with time served. (So far, close to 2,300 have been released.) Many were serial offenders who were sent away for life after one last witless screwup, like Lester Wallace, who was caught trying to steal a car radio on the first morning the law went into effect, or Curtis Wilkerson, who did 16 years of his life sentence after shoplifting a pair of socks from a department store called Mervyn’s. When Wilkerson got out, he sounded as if he couldn’t believe the whole thing: ‘‘Ordinary white socks,’’ he told Rolling Stone. ‘‘Didn’t even have any stripes.’’

Unlike typical parolees, third-strikers are often notified of their release just before it happens, sometimes only a day in advance. (It can take months for a judge to rule after papers are filed.) They’re usually sent out the door with $200, a not-insubstantial share of which they often pay back to the prison for a lift to the nearest Greyhound station: An inmate might be released from a prison outside Sacramento and expected to find his way to a parole officer in San Diego, 500 miles away, within 48 hours. Stanford’s Three Strikes Project was setting up transitional housing for its clients, but initially, a lot of the third-strikers weren’t making it there — they were just blowing away in the wind. Then, Carlos and Roby started driving around the state and waiting outside to catch them.

The job started as a simple delivery service, to carry some of these discombobulated bodies from one place to another. In late 2013, the director of the Three Strikes Project, Michael Romano, contacted a nonprofit called the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, which has built up a close community of formerly incarcerated people in Los Angeles. (Romano, who is also an A.R.C. board member, is a friend of mine.) Romano asked if A.R.C. could dispatch one of its members to pick up third-strikers and drive them to their housing near the Staples Center in Los Angeles. A.R.C. recommended Carlos, a dependable young man just three years out of prison himself, who — most important — also had his own car and a credit card to front money for gas. Carlos was hired, for $12 an hour, to fetch an old man named Terry Critton from a prison in Chino. On the way back, Critton asked if Carlos wouldn’t mind stopping at Amoeba Records, so he could look at jazz LPs — he’d been a big collector. They wound up spending almost two hours in the store, just looking. Then, Critton wanted a patty melt, so Carlos found a place called Flooky’s, where they ordered two and caught the end of a Dodgers game. It was extraordinary: All day, Carlos could see this man coming back to life. He wanted to do more pickups, and he wanted to get his friend Roby involved. He told his bosses he needed a partner.

By now, Carlos and Roby — officially, A.R.C.’s Ride Home Program — have done about three dozen pickups, either together or individually, waking up long before dawn and driving for hours toward prison towns deep in the desert or up the coast. Then they spend all day with the guy (so far they’ve picked up only men), taking him to eat, buying him some clothes, advising him, swapping stories, dialing his family on their cellphones or astonishing him by magically calling up Facebook pictures of nieces and nephews he’s never met — or just sitting quietly, to let him depressurize. The conversation with those shellshocked total strangers doesn’t always flow, Roby told me. It helps to have a wingman.

‘‘The first day is everything,’’ Carlos says — a barrage of insignificant-seeming experiences with potentially big consequences. Consider, for example, a friend of his and Roby’s: Julio Acosta, who was paroled in 2013 after 23 years inside. Acosta describes stopping for breakfast near the prison that first morning as if it were a horrifying fever dream: He kept looking around the restaurant for a sniper, as in the chow hall in prison, and couldn’t stop gawking at the metal knives and forks, ‘‘like an Aztec looking at Cortez’s helmet,’’ he says. It wasn’t until he got up from the booth and walked to the men’s room, and a man came out the door and said, ‘‘How you doin’?’’ and Acosta said, ‘‘Fine,’’ that Acosta began to feel, even slightly, like a legitimate part of the environment around him. He’d accomplished something. He’d made a treacherous trip across an International House of Pancakes. He’d peed.

But what if Acosta had accidentally bumped into a waitress, knocking over her tray and shattering dishes? What if that man had glared at him, instead of greeting him, or snapped at him to get the hell out of the way? Ann Jacobs, director of the Prisoner Re-entry Institute at New York’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told me that even the smallest bungled interactions on the outside leave recently incarcerated people feeling ‘‘like they’re being exposed, like they’re incompetent. It’s feeding into their worst fear, their perception of themselves as an impostor who’s incapable of living a normal life.’’ Carlos and Roby have learned to steer their guys through that perilous newness — and to be nonchalant about it, to make the sudden enormity of life feel unthreatening, even fun. On one ride home earlier this year, I watched a third-striker venture inside a convenience store, alone, to buy a candy bar while Roby pumped gas. The man seemed emboldened after a few hours of freedom, actually hopping a bit as he walked. But then he tripped over the curb and tumbled forward, arms thrashing, nearly face-planting in front of the door. Roby just shrugged and said, ‘‘Well, you’ve got to get that one out of the way.’’

‘‘Been a long time since I looked at a menu,’’ Dale Hammock said. He was sheltered in a corner of a booth at a Denny’s near the prison. The restaurant was overcrowded, loud and full of the kind of hyperdifferentiated nonsense that ordinary Americans swim through every day, never assuming it can or should be fully understood. But Hammock was having trouble sorting the breakfast menu from the lunch menu, and the regular Denny’s menu from the Denny’s Skillets Across America limited-time menu. There were two kinds of hot sauce and four different sweeteners on the table. On the Heinz ketchup bottle, it said: ‘‘Up for a Game? Trivial Pursuit Tomato Ketchup.’’

The first meal after a long prison sentence is an ostensible celebration laced with stress. The food tastes incredible. (Roby gained 60 pounds after his release, desperate to try the Outback Steakhouse Bloomin’ Onion and other fast-casual delicacies he’d seen commercials for on TV.) But ordering — making any choice — can be unnerving. Waiters are intimidating; waitresses, especially pretty ones, can be petrifying. So at Denny’s, Roby started things off, ordering a chocolate milk. Hammock ordered a chocolate milk, too. Then he reconsidered and said: ‘‘I want a milkshake! I’ll just have that!’’ He ordered a Grand Slam. Then he changed it to a Lumberjack Slam. And when the waiter shot back with ‘‘Toast: white, wheat or sourdough?’’ Hammock went stiff momentarily, then answered: ‘‘Toast, I guess.’’

One morning 21 years ago, Hammock was pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt, and the cop found a half-pound of methamphetamine under the passenger seat. (Hammock was driving a friend’s car and claims he didn’t know the drugs were there, but the police report also notes that he had a small amount of meth in his pocket and was carrying close to $1,000.) He’d been an addict most of his life, flying in and out of prison with some 30 arrests and a dozen other drug or drug-related charges behind him. In 1973, he shot and injured a man while trying to rob him, and in 1978 he snatched a 19-year-old woman’s purse. (There was $2 inside.) Those two charges both counted as ‘‘strikes.’’ The meth in the car was Hammock’s third. He was given a sentence of 31 years to life.

He moved through 10 different prisons and watched firsthand as the age of mass incarceration took hold. In the 42 years between his first strike and his release, the state’s prison population quintupled. Facilities started running at 135 percent capacity, gyms were converted into dorms, all kinds of privileges were discontinued (some prisons even outlawed fresh fruit, to crack down on homemade alcohol) and everyone, Hammock said — the inmates and the guards — started walking around with more abrasive attitudes. Hammock, meanwhile, had mellowed somewhat, become an old man. For the last five or six years, he’d been the prison barber, which required him to shuttle among the different housing units and stay on good terms with everyone; a supervisor’s report praised him as an ‘‘asset’’ who mentored younger, more volatile inmates. He was too worn out to be menacing anymore. Gabbing with Carlos and Roby while they waited for their table, he explained wearily that, years ago, ‘‘I stabbed two guys in Soledad. But you know how that goes, those situations arise sometimes’’ — either them or you.

Freedom hadn’t instantly re-energized him. From the moment he hopped into Carlos and Roby’s car that morning, he’d seemed less gung-ho than accepting — a good sport. ‘‘Oh, boy, it’s going to be different,’’ he kept saying, or, ‘‘It’s going to be an experience, brother, I swear to God.’’ Several times, he told them: ‘‘I was thinking about trying to get into barber college,’’ latching onto that phrase like a handrail on a shaky train. This was the one thing Dale Hammock knew right now: ‘‘I’ve been thinking about barber college, if I could get enrolled in barber college.’’

His milkshake came. He took a tentative sip, then removed the straw and started gulping. Roby took a picture on his phone, showed it to Hammock, then zapped it off to the team at Stanford. Hammock was amazed. ‘‘Everything now, you just touch it, and it shows you things?’’ he asked. It was like having breakfast with a time traveler. Was he correct in noticing that men didn’t wear their hair long anymore? Was it true that everyone had stopped using cash? Later, in the restroom, he wrenched the front of the automatic soap dispenser off its base instead of waving his hand under it.

Carlos and Roby had been careful so far not to overwhelm Hammock, but with his milkshake in place, they eased into discussing some practicalities. They talked about cellphone plans and how to get two forms of ID, so Hammock could register for welfare and other assistance. This was the beginning of Carlos and Roby’s signature re-entry crash course, rooted in their own experiences coming home, which they casually threaded through the duration of every ride. Hammock seemed determined to figure it all out. He didn’t see an alternative. ‘‘I’m too tired of prison,’’ he told them. ‘‘I know that.’’

If he was serious about cutting hair, Carlos said, there was a government rehabilitation program that might pay for his licensure classes. Roby offered to buy him a set of clippers so he could get a little business going right away, giving haircuts to the other third-strikers at the housing facility where they were heading. In fact, Carlos added, he commuted past there every day. ‘‘I was thinking you could hook me up, and I’ll pay you to cut my hair.’’

‘‘No problem, no problem at all,’’ Hammock said, tilting his head to size up Carlos’s fade. ‘‘You keep it short like that?’’ He sounded just like a barber.

Carlos encouraged him: He’d have to hustle and find a niche, just as prisoners are accustomed to doing inside. ‘‘You already have the tools,’’ Carlos explained. ‘‘It’s just about applying them now to a different environment. You know how to dictate how people treat you. You know how to tell who’s going to scam you and who’s not. Using that same psychology, you’re going to be all right.’’

Hammock nodded. This seemed to make sense to him in a way that nothing else had so far. ‘‘I’ll be all right — it’s just going to take a minute, that’s all,’’ he said. ‘‘Looks like it’s time to eat.’’

His breakfast took up three separate plates. He ate inelegantly and quickly, working the food over with his half-set of dentures and toothless lower gums. When he was done, he bellowed, ‘‘Well, I’m not hungry no more!’’ Then, with that out of the way, he looked across the table at Carlos and asked, ‘‘How long you been out?’’

The first ride home Carlos and Roby did together was in February 2014. They were dispatched for an early-morning pickup at San Quentin, seven hours from Los Angeles in Marin County, and Michael Romano, the director of the Three Strikes Project, suggested they drive up the day before and stay at his house in San Francisco. He expected to take them out to dinner — get to know them, spoil them a bit. Instead, Carlos and Roby rolled in after midnight and unceremoniously bedded down on a couple of couches.

Lying there, it hit them how unusual this was: They were both still on parole at the time, but here they were, welcomed into this white lawyer’s home in the middle of the night, while his wife and two little children slept upstairs. ‘‘That really changed everything,’’ Carlos remembers. ‘‘It changed our perspective of how people actually viewed us.’’ He and Roby had been locked up so young that they’d never lived as regular, trustworthy adults. This, they told each other before falling asleep, must be what it feels like.

Carlos grew up in the San Gabriel Valley, east of downtown L.A. His father walked out on his mother while she was still pregnant with him, and Carlos had the misfortune of reminding her of his dad, he says, which made her resentful and abusive. Soon she remarried, but while her new husband bought his own two sons new clothes and Super Nintendos, Carlos and his older brother got none of that. Once, when Carlos was 11, his father mailed him $50 — $100 actually, but his mother took a cut — and Carlos immediately picked up the phone and ordered a medium pizza. When the doorbell rang, he paid the delivery guy, took the pizza inside and ate it out of the box, very methodically, in front of his family. He remembers the scene clearly — how shocked everyone was that he had something of his own and wasn’t giving any of it to them. ‘‘And I was like: ‘Yeah, but it’s my pizza. I’m going to sit here and enjoy this pizza.’ ’’ He liked the feeling of satisfaction money brought. So he started stealing bikes and breaking into houses. ‘‘After that, my life was thieving,’’ Carlos says. ‘‘I was a thief, for sure.’’

His childhood turned even more formless and reckless. He had started smoking pot at 9, and by 15 he was a heavy meth user who spent all day in the street. His mother warned him he would end up in jail — sort of. ‘‘She said, ‘I hope you [expletive] end up in jail,’ ’’ Carlos remembers. ‘‘And in Spanish, trust me, it sounds even worse. Two weeks later, I was arrested.’’

One afternoon, some older gang members jumped Carlos, knocking him off his bike and beating him, and Carlos enlisted two friends to drive around with him, looking to retaliate. One of them wound up shooting at a young man from the car, Carlos explained, injuring him; Carlos was the only one arrested. After waiting in a county jail for nearly two years, he says, he was finally offered a deal: He could plead guilty to attempted murder and be sentenced as an adult to 12 years, or he could fight the charge and get 35 to life if he lost. Carlos took the deal. He was 16.

Carlos floundered in prison but found a mentor after a few years — an older cellmate, also named Carlos. Under the older Carlos’s influence, he began willing his way into adulthood: studying, reading, examining his anger. A girl from his neighborhood started driving out to see him, and they eventually married. After a few conjugal visits, they had a baby, a daughter Carlos met one Saturday morning in the prison visiting room. Over the years, Carlos saw inmates go home and then wind up back inside; the system seemed to offer little preparation for release, setting them up for failure. He started mailing away for details about advocacy groups, housing, Social Security, driver’s licenses — not just in Los Angeles, where he’d be living when he got out, but in counties around California, so he could share what he learned with other inmates. He made packets of information and put a notice on the prison bulletin board, next to the day’s menu: If you’re getting out and need any ‘‘resources,’’ as he called them, come talk to Carlos in Bunk 28 Low. The prison’s chaplain told me, ‘‘He was basically a social worker behind bars.’’

By that point, Carlos was housed at the California Rehabilitation Center, not far outside L.A. He was part of a small circle of more mature inmates who, having done time at high-security prisons, were taking college classes, looking for calm in the last years of their sentences. Among them was a wisecracking Asian guy whom everyone knew as Big Head. His real name was Roby So.

Roby’s story was less gothic than Carlos’s, but it had led him to the same dismal place. His parents escaped the killing fields in Cambodia and opened a Laundromat and a bargain store in Los Angeles. He grew up in Echo Park, near Dodger Stadium, a dangerous neighborhood in the 1980s, where he fell in with a gang of other Cambodian kids called the Oriental Boys. Roby was seven years into a 13-year sentence when he met Carlos, having pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted murder in 1998. (Roby says he drove four friends to a party in San Diego, and one fired a handgun at a rival there and missed; the gun was still in Roby’s trunk when they were all arrested at a gas station the next day.)

Prison society is usually strictly segregated, so it was no small thing when Carlos, a Mexican, and Roby, an Asian guy, struck up a friendship. Roby would walk across the dorm to Carlos’s bunk and sit down on the other bed — oblivious to, or uninterested in, whether he was welcome on it — and they’d fall into long conversations about books and life. Breaking bread with another race is especially taboo, but Carlos and Roby frequently cooked meals for each other anyway, improvising with ingredients pocketed in the dining hall or bought from the commissary. Roby made the first one for Carlos on the floor of his bunk, cooking rice, canned mackerel and rehydrated bean soup in a bucket of water, which he heated with a ‘‘stinger’’ — a metal rod resembling a curling iron. Then he puréed all of it, piled it in an egg-roll wrapper and topped it with sriracha. (In retrospect, the dish was symbolic: an Asian-fusion burrito.) On Saturdays, Carlos and Roby would sit side by side watching a block of cooking shows on PBS: ‘‘Yan Can Cook,’’ ‘‘Simply Ming,’’ ‘‘Mexico — One Plate at a Time With Rick Bayless.’’ They picked up techniques and gathered ideas. ‘‘Like, instead of onions, let’s try a little more ginger,’’ Roby explains.

‘‘Once we started talking, it was like I knew this guy already,’’ Carlos remembers. ‘‘He had the same energy, the same mentality.’’ They discovered they were scheduled to be paroled one day apart, and plotted their re-entry into Los Angeles together. Then, once they were out, they started executing the plans they’d assembled on Carlos’s bunk. They went to file for government relief payments together. They waited at the D.M.V. together, wondering why everyone else there seemed so impatient and aggravated. And they held each other accountable to their respective to-do lists. Eventually, Carlos found a job as a contractor, and he now works for a nonprofit that guides kids through the juvenile justice system. Roby started fiddling with a GoPro and taught himself video editing. Last year, he lucked into a job on a show that streams on Yahoo.

Waiting outside the prison for Hammock that morning, Roby got an email on his phone that The New York Times had just published the first review of the show, ‘‘Sin City Saints,’’ online. He started reading it out loud to Carlos. But the knocks came pretty quickly — ‘‘a disjointed and not particularly funny series’’ — and his excitement curdled. ‘‘Blah, blah, blah. You’re just giving your opinion,’’ Roby finally said to his phone. ‘‘Let’s let the viewers decide.’’ Then he put the thing away and started digging idly through the glove box.

The opening riff of ‘‘Good Times, Bad Times’’ kicked in on the stereo as they hit Los Angeles County, just before 2 p.m. Carlos bobbed his head in the back seat. The mood in the car was up — for a minute or two. Then, construction work narrowed Route 101, and Roby grumbled as they slowed nearly to a stop. ‘‘See that, Dale?’’ he asked Hammock. ‘‘I’m complaining about traffic. You know what that’s called?’’

‘‘No,’’ Hammock said.

‘‘That’s called ‘free-man problems,’ ’’ Roby said.

They fought through the congestion to their next stop, a Target in downtown L.A., where Roby put Hammock in charge of the big red shopping cart. ‘‘There you go, pushing a cart!’’ he shouted as they set off into the aisles. ‘‘Who would’ve thunk it!’’

Every ride home includes a stop to get the third-striker out of his sweats and buy him some real clothes and basic toiletries. It’s typically the last thing Carlos and Roby do; walking into a crowded big-box store asks a lot of these guys. Roby was released on Presidents’ Day weekend, and his father and cousins took him straight to an outlet mall. The swarm of bargain-seeking humanity overwhelmed him. In prison, people move slowly, drag their feet and keep their distance; all of a sudden, Roby was being jostled and bumped. And after 12 years in the same state-issued clothing, he had no idea what to buy. When his father asked him what size he was, Roby told him: ‘‘I don’t have a size.’’

Now, Roby tends to take the lead at Target, working as a kind of unflappable personal shopper for the third-strikers, like a kid eager to do tricks on a piece of playground equipment that once scared him. ‘‘You look like a 34,’’ he told Hammock. He led him to a dismayingly large wall of jeans: several different brands; slim, boot cut, carpenter. When Hammock finally reached for a pair, Roby told him to gauge the waistline by stretching it around his neck.

‘‘Around my neck?’’ Hammock asked.

‘‘Yeah,’’ Roby told him. ‘‘I learned it from Oprah.’’

Soon, they moved on to shirts. Then underwear. Then socks. It was like marching Hammock through the stations of some consumerist cross. He peered into the racks of razors with names like military fighter jets: Schick Xtreme, BIC Hybrid Advance 3. He confronted the toothbrushes: Colgate 2X Whitening Action, Colgate 360 Degree Whole Mouth Clean, Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean. In the deodorant aisle, there was an entire section of Old Spices named after wild animals. Carlos always likes to recommend AXE — he believes in the company’s products — and this time, he gasped slightly when he noticed the apparently rare AXE White Label antiperspirant on a high shelf. He took off the cap to smell it — Forest Scent — then extended it to Hammock. ‘‘Are you an AXE man?’’ Carlos asked. When Hammock decided to go another way, Carlos seemed hurt.

They got toothpaste. They got soap. Roby upsold Hammock on a reversible belt. Often, as they arrived in front of the next expanse of products, Roby and Carlos would shoot each other side-eyed glances, eager to see what Hammock would do. Their policy was to throw the third-strikers into these challenges, rather than coddle them. This was ordinary life. It was safe; it was fun. ‘‘Take this and slide it,’’ Roby now told Hammock, handing him his credit card at the register. Hammock dragged the card through the slot methodically, formally, turning to face Roby’s camera, as though at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. But it didn’t catch. ‘‘I think you gotta go faster,’’ Roby said. And so Hammock slid it again. The machine gave off a satisfying beep: success.

There was one more thing, though. Carlos was already in line at the Starbucks kiosk near the entrance, ordering Hammock what he described to him as a ‘‘Cadillac’’ — prison slang for sweet, milky coffee. Soon came the announcement: ‘‘Grande caramel macchiato for Dale!’’

Hammock took a sip. He looked nearly as stunned as he had the moment they met him that morning, when he was driven out of prison backward after 21 years. ‘‘Wow,’’ he said. Carlos and Roby burst out laughing. But Hammock was not laughing. He was very serious. ‘‘Wow,’’ he said again. ‘‘Coffee’s come a long way! This here’s the Rolls-Royce of Cadillacs!’’

He took another sip. He shook his head and peered down, through the sip hole in the lid, trying to understand what this stuff was and how it came to be his. Someone had even written his name, ‘‘Dale,’’ on the side of cup.

It was a short drive through downtown from Target to their final destination. Everyone seemed drained. Carlos said almost nothing, while Roby crammed a few last bits of acclimating information into the conversation, seemingly as they occurred to him. (Some parking spots downtown cost $192 a month. ‘‘There’s this thing called a Keurig.’’) He turned to Hammock and asked, ‘‘How you feel so far?’’

Hammock didn’t know what to say, so Roby rephrased the question: ‘‘Are you free yet?’’

‘‘I’m getting there,’’ Hammock told him.

Soon they were all climbing out of the car in front of the Amity Foundation, the housing and rehabilitation center where Carlos and Roby have been delivering most of their third-strikers for the last year and a half. One of them, Stanley Bailey, was meeting them downstairs to help Hammock get settled.

All day, Carlos and Roby had been slipping inspirational details about Bailey into their conversations with Hammock. He was a solid role model: a 53-year-old longtime heroin addict who had been locked up for 25 years. Carlos had picked him up at Ironwood State Prison in October. Now, five months later, he was doing public speaking at criminal-justice nonprofits and universities and working doggedly to get his truck driver’s license. Recently, he’d run the Los Angeles Marathon. ‘‘He’s the story I always tell,’’ Carlos said.

Bailey met them at Amity’s registration desk, dispensing big, wholehearted bro hugs. ‘‘Hey, Running Man!’’ Roby shouted. Like Hammock, Bailey had zero hair on his head and a full, black sleeve of indecipherable tattoos on each arm. But he was slimmer, healthier-looking — glowing, comparatively, in a light blue polo shirt. When he introduced himself to Hammock, it was like watching him shake hands with some wrinkled and diminished alternate self.

The two third-strikers sidled into an easy back and forth, comparing which prisons they’d been in, finding some overlap. Hammock took another sip of his Starbucks drink — he was still nursing it — and lifted the cup to show Bailey. ‘‘This thing here,’’ he said, and made a whistling sound. He still couldn’t put it into words. Then, after a while, Carlos and Roby wrote their phone numbers on a slip of paper for Hammock and said goodbye — nothing dramatic; they’d stay in close touch. They always did. Hammock corralled each of them into a hug, one at a time. ‘‘Thank you, brother,’’ he told Carlos.

Bailey followed Carlos and Roby into the hall. He wanted a word, in private. He’d called Carlos earlier that day to ask for advice and wanted to finish the conversation. (They still texted and spoke frequently; whenever Carlos was downtown, he’d take Bailey out for tacos.) The truth was, Bailey was struggling and frustrated; he was being held up as a re-entry success story, but his situation was precarious. He seemed to be hustling in all the right ways, volunteering at several nonprofits and now at a trucking company down the street too — sweeping up, or doing odd chores, just so he could sit in their truck cabs with his driver’s manual and study. But things still weren’t coming together. He’d gotten stalled for months, trying to track down a copy of his birth certificate, without which he couldn’t get other forms of ID, access to government aid or his learner’s permit. All the celebrated speaking gigs he did were unpaid, and his funding to stay at Amity was almost up. He wasn’t sure where he’d go. Though he’d reconnected with a woman in Colorado, one condition of his release was that he wasn’t allowed to leave the state. It was as if Bailey were swimming determinedly away from some monstrous undertow, trying to keep the distance he’d put between himself and his past from closing. ‘‘To be honest, I’m not looking for a big, big life,’’ he said. ‘‘I just want to be remembered for more than what I was.’’

Carlos slipped some money into Bailey’s hand as he shook it and said goodbye. (That night, he’d start emailing people on Bailey’s behalf, even asking if Stanford and A.R.C. would consider hiring Bailey to ride along with him and Roby sometimes.) Down the hall, meanwhile, Hammock was finishing his intake interview and getting to know a couple of former lifers in the building. An older man who was paroled last Christmas Day after 31 years asked how his day had gone. ‘‘You been inside a store yet?’’ the man said.

‘‘Yeah,’’ Hammock told him. It sounded like nothing, but it wasn’t. He’d made it all the way here, to the beginning.",REAL
Power in Numbers,"The world’s largest recurring convention of people and their machines is DreamHack, a 72-hour rally that takes place twice a year in the convention center in Jonkoping, Sweden, a lake city about 200 miles southwest of Stockholm. The most recent jamboree hosted more than 23,000 people from at least 55 nations and every inhabited continent; on their 9,500 computers (as well as 14,000 other network-­connected devices), the attendees made up what organizers believe to be the largest impromptu LAN, or local area network, assembled anywhere.

DreamHack began in 1994, in the basement of a nearby elementary school, as a small, local subvariant of what was then called a ‘‘copy­party’’ — pre-­broadband occasions to share software or demonstrate flashy off-­label uses of early home computers. As the event has grown, its enormous ad hoc network has been given over largely to gaming; for far-flung clans of four or five teammates, this can be the only chance they get all year to palaver in person. But participants also use the LAN to collaborate on all manner of projects, from songs to films to digital artworks, all of which are presented to the crowd.

Franck Bohbot, a 35-year-old Parisian photographer who has lived in Brooklyn since 2013, traveled to this summer’s DreamHack and captured the event’s dazzling disarray. He calls his experience there ‘‘monumental, but also very scary — to see all of this digital consumerism in one place.’’ For three round-the-clock days, he captured Boschian visions of digital abandon. ‘‘Everyone was geeking out,’’ he says. ‘‘It was a cathedral of the digital world.’’ What is immedi­ately arresting about the photographs themselves is their emphasis on the corporeal. Bohbot documented the bodies behind the user names, and you can’t help being struck by their range of personal ornamentation: the fuzzy-­unicorn hats and other eccentric headpieces, the wiz­ardly wig beards and electric mohawks, the piercings and tattoos.

Bodies, of course, no matter the sustained commitment to caffeine intake, are prone to breakdown, and Bohbot was drawn not only to those alert at their monitors but also to those collapsed at the feast, facedown in pillows that soften their keyboards. (Bohbot noted that most people are very politely quiet in the evenings, to let the weary rest.) Even the machines, in Bohbot’s vision, begin to take on an almost biological form. Home-­rigged computer towers with translucent siding, their interiors threaded with the elliptical glow of LEDs, resemble those integrated-­circuit fishes of the sea’s dark sulfurous trenches; the tangles of Ethernet cables swamp the tables in a tentacular turmoil, like gray kelp strewed about by a receding tide.",REAL
How Hip-Hop Is Becoming the Oldies,"The two men brought the idea to Cumulus’s executive vice president of content and programming, John Dickey. Around the same time, Dickey caught word that Radio One was planning to launch a Boom clone in Indianapolis. He was determined to beat them to market. He told Morris to do a ‘‘classic hip-hop holiday weekend,’’ to test listener reaction and stake their claim to the format in Indianapolis.

Michaels dropped the needle on Naughty by Nature’s ‘‘Hip Hop Hooray’’ at 3 p.m. on Dec. 19. LL Cool J’s ‘‘Around the Way Girl’’ followed, then ‘‘Move,’’ by Ludacris. ‘‘We set up a voice-mail box for listener feedback,’’ Michaels said. ‘‘I was expecting lots of complaints. We went from playing Maroon 5 to ‘Me So Horny.’ ’’ The phone rang so much they had to clear the mailbox every day. Callers were ecstatic. The station never returned to its old format.

In three weeks, 93.9 made the improbable jump from 15th place in Central Indiana to first. Two weeks later, i94 officially became 93.9, the Beat. Ratings for January showed 93.9 with a 7.7 share. It ranked first among people ages 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54; women 18-34, 18-49 and 25-54; and men 18-49 and 25-54. ‘‘Literally nobody in the Top 50 markets in this country has ever done a format change, then in the next full month shot to No. 1,’’ Tom Taylor, the publisher of a popular radio-industry newsletter, told Indianapolis Business Journal. ‘‘Certainly no station in the last decade has done what [WRWM] has.’’ The Beat stole a huge piece of the listenership of Radio One’s top urban stations in Indianapolis, too: WTLC-FM 106.7, ‘‘Indy’s R & B Leader,’’ dropped to 4.5 in January from a 6.6 in December. WHHH-FM 96.3, Radio One’s mainstream urban station, saw its share plummet to 3.9 in January from 5.1 in December. Meanwhile, the Beat’s advertising rates grew by 150 percent.

Ever since the earliest days of rock ’n’ roll, time has corroded yesterday’s musical radicalism into today’s pabulum. Thirty years ago, young listeners of hip-hop, with its predilection for violent imagery and unprintable language, might have thought it impervious to this process. But radio conglomerates are proving them wrong. As its listeners grow up and memories of Tipper Gore grow dim, hip-hop is now taking its final step toward respectability: It now qualifies as oldies.

I sat with Jay Michaels one morning this spring while he worked on the Beat’s weekend playlist. His office is tiny, airless and cluttered with Hello Kitty lunchboxes, promotional teddy bears, novelty coffee cups and rubber duckies. On his computer, he had loaded Stratus, Cumulus’s proprietary music-­scheduling software. He pressed a button, and dozens of songs populated a grid on the screen, color-coded in a pattern that Michaels refused to explain. Michaels and Morris are cagey about Stratus, which is used companywide but customized by each station. They refer to the software as their ‘‘secret sauce.’’ What I gleaned through later conversations is that Michaels has broken hip-hop down by region and into subgenres, and the Beat uses these metadata tags to keep its playlist diverse.

On Cumulus’s version of the format, you’ll never hear back-to-back-to-back Southern rap hits or a cluster of R & B songs with female vocalists; the Beat will break up a block of tunes by harder artists like Ice Cube or DMX with a Mariah Carey track. ‘‘Without flow, this format is a train wreck,’’ Michaels said as he sifted through the computer’s selections, massaging the playlist. ‘‘It’s me being overly anal. I have my own rules.’’ Among them: Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac should never be played back to back (it might call to mind their deadly feud), and a Biggie song should never be played before or after ‘‘I’ll Be Missing You,’’ the tribute song Puff Daddy recorded after Biggie was killed. Michaels also won’t play Outkast next to Ludacris — it just feels weird.

The Beat is just one of several stations experimenting with the format now, and certainly such rules differ in each city. But the basics of the formula are the same that were developed by Radio One in October. That was the month the company unplugged a failing news station in Houston, 92.1 KROI-FM, dismissed all the employees and started playing Beyoncé songs, commercial-free, 24 hours a day. Beyoncé’s fans — the BeyHive — went bonkers. News outlets from all over the country called with questions about the odd format. On the afternoon of the fifth day, the station paused for a commercial and then played ‘‘Mind Playing Tricks on Me’’ by the Geto Boys, arguably Houston’s most famous contribution to rap music. Notorious B.I.G. followed, then Tupac, then Salt-N-Pepa.

The early ratings returns were astounding. The station’s audience shot to 802,000 from 245,000, and its Nielsen share went to 3.2 from 1.0. Shortly after that, Radio One started similar stations in Philadelphia and Dallas and saw a gain of 200,000 listeners in each of those cities. Soon, 15 more stations, including 93.9, made the switch.

A cynical but not inaccurate way of thinking about radio formats is as a tool to segment the population for advertisers. Ancient and unglamorous as it may be, radio remains a potent vehicle for advertisers to access consumers. According to a 2015 Nielsen Audio Today report, 91 percent of Americans age 12 or older listen to the radio each week, and the vast majority of those listeners are in the work force (which means they have money to spend). According to another Nielsen study, advertisers achieve more than $6 of incremental sales for every $1 spent on the radio. For radio-station owners, the business plan is simple: Attract the broadest possible audience to your programming and then do everything you can to keep them listening. This is why radio professionals talk about musical genres in ways normal human beings do not; no one believes she listens to rhythmic adult contemporary, but in aggregate, millions of people between the ages of 25 and 54 do.

The Beat, and stations like it, target listeners in their mid-20s to mid-40s: people who grew up during rap’s golden era. This is a subset of the population that is outgrowing contemporary hip-hop radio (which targets the 18-34 demographic) but is mostly too young to be nostalgic for ’70s and ’80s stations and too hip for adult contemporary. They are also entering the prime spending years of their lives — marriage, children, car buying and homeownership — and radio, like all forms of media, is figuring out how to catch them.

In a sense, classic hip-hop is following a radio trend that began in the early 1970s, when the first dedicated FM oldies stations started up in Phoenix, playing records by old crooners and doo-wop quartets. The format was a hit, and it quickly spread to Los Angeles and New York, and everywhere else. Oldies reached its zenith in the 1980s, just as classic rock — a new iteration of the same concept — was born. Same story: The format grew as programmers looked for new ways to keep grown-up baby boomers tuned in.

Over the years, people in the radio business have discovered that even these seemingly static formats are quite pliable. Davey Morris told me about B101, a once-venerable oldies station in Providence, R.I. ‘‘When I first started listening, they were playing hits from the ’50s and early ’60s,’’ he said. ‘‘Now they’re playing the Police.’’ The Crests, the Platters and the Chordettes are being shoved aside, saved for Saturday-night specialty shows. At the same time, the leading edge of classic-rock stations continues to slide forward, and many are adding ’90s acts to their rotation: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Green Day and others. ‘‘If classic rock wasn’t careful, it was going to age itself out of the buying demos,’’ Jon Miller, vice president of audience insights at Nielsen, told me. ‘‘It would be left with an aging audience that isn’t appealing to Madison Avenue.’’

Slide Show

One person at the Beat told me that the station’s ideal listener is a woman between 35 and 44 who is a homeowner and her family’s decision maker. As of now, around 50 percent of the Beat’s audience is white, 45 percent is black and 4 percent is Hispanic (just 10 percent of Indianapolis is Hispanic). By contrast, the city’s top contemporary hip-hop station, WHHH, has an audience that is 68 percent black, 6 percent Hispanic and around 25 percent white. With the Beat, Dickey said the station had achieved universal likability. ‘‘The format is multicultural,’’ he said. ‘‘Anybody — black, white or Hispanic — can claim ownership of this music.’’

Though they’re in the odd position of creating something like a canon for rap music, Morris and the other programmers I spoke with made it clear that they don’t see themselves as stewards of the genre. Their job is to play the hits. Morris, in particular, is looking forward to the summer, when he thinks the Beat’s true potential will be realized. ‘‘People are going to drive around with their windows down and this music blasting,’’ he said. ‘‘They’re going to play it at the beach and at parties. It’s going to be like popcorn and bonbons: We’re just going to keep feeding them hits.’’

Today, that’s easier than ever. Using something called a Portable People Meter, which looks like a beeper, Nielsen collects listening data from its survey participants by detecting hidden tones in a station’s audio stream. The meters can tell which station the panelists are listening to, whether they’re at home or away and how long a listener stays on a station. Independent analysts can provide even more granular data than that, allowing radio programmers to gauge which songs people respond well to and which tracks push them to change the station.

Nielsen recently analyzed four months’ worth of airplay data at 11 new classic hip-hop stations all over the country (including Boom), from Philadelphia to the San Francisco Bay Area, to determine the Top 50 songs in the format. The songs cover the 13 years from 1991 to 2004, with a pronounced feel-good bent and subtle West Coast bias. The Top 5 are: Luniz, ‘‘I Got 5 on It’’; Ice Cube, ‘‘It Was a Good Day’’; Snoop Doggy Dogg, ‘‘Gin and Juice’’; Notorious B.I.G., ‘‘One More Chance’’; and 50 Cent, ‘‘In Da Club.’’ Tupac’s ‘‘How Do U Want It,’’ ‘‘I Get Around’’ and ‘‘California Love’’ are in the Top 25; his more barbed songs, like ‘‘Brenda’s Got a Baby’’ and ‘‘2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,’’ aren’t even in the Top 50. The Wu-Tang Clan is represented only by Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s crossover hit ‘‘Got Your Money.’’ Somehow, Chingy’s ‘‘Right Thurr’’ has the No. 33 spot.

There has always been a tension in hip-hop between those songs that are made for radio play and songs that were made for the real fans. But the classic hip-hop format seems to act like a sieve that catches only the most radio-friendly of the past’s radio-friendly records. Take, for example, ‘‘It Was a Good Day.’’ That song wasn’t even Ice Cube’s biggest hit in 1993, the year it came out; ‘‘Check Yo Self’’ was. But ‘‘Check Yo Self’’ is a song typical of early ’90s Ice Cube — angry and violent, with jokes about S.T.D.s, guns and prison rape — and ‘‘Good Day’’ is downright happy go lucky. In it, Ice Cube eats a halal breakfast; wins at basketball, dice and dominoes; and sees his name written in lights on the Goodyear blimp.

In May, I visited WRWM and sat in on its drive-time program. Notorious B.I.G.’s ‘‘Juicy’’ played as we approached the 3 o’clock hour. Manning the boards was Zack Babb, a.k.a. Zakk, who hosts a show, weekdays from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Zakk, who is 27, tall and blond, wore board shorts and canvas sneakers and spent his downtime watching the traffic on Interstate 465 out the window. He watches it stack up every day, he told me. He seemed thrilled by it.

There are just three on-air personalities at the Beat, including Zakk, who did just about everything but decide which song came next. While the music played, he recorded and edited the other elements that go into radio: sweepers, bumpers, ramps, promos. In preparation for a prescheduled spin of Mark Morrison’s ‘‘Return of the Mack,’’ Zakk recorded a ramp: ‘‘Remember hearing this one at United Skates of America? Some guys at the rink used to do a cool backward shuffle to this song. Every time I tried it, I fell on my butt.’’ (Roller-skating, he explained to me, was huge in and around Indianapolis in the 1990s.)

As hours in the studio glided by, so did the utterly irresistible blend of rap and R & B hits: Outkast’s ‘‘Hey Ya!’’ led to Wreckx-N-Effect’s ‘‘Rump Shaker.’’ Then Keith Sweat’s ‘‘Make You Sweat’’ played into Coolio’s ‘‘Fantastic Voyage.’’ When ‘‘Still Fly,’’ by Big Tymers, came on, Zakk fondly recalled blowing out his dad’s speakers as a kid. Each hour was announced by a new classic hip-hop standard. At 4 p.m., it was Tupac and Dr. Dre’s ‘‘California Love.’’ At 5, as traffic on Interstate 465 slowed, it was Jay Z and UGK’s ‘‘Big Pimpin’.’’ Snoop took us into cocktail hour with ‘‘Gin and Juice’’ at 6.

The traffic on the Interstate had halted by then, and I marveled out loud at the symmetry of the scene. We were sitting in a radio station, gazing out at people held prisoner with nothing to do but listen. I asked Zakk to look out the window and tell me the first thing that came to mind. He grinned widely and said, earnestly: ‘‘I imagine all of those people in their cars dancing.’’",REAL
How ‘Privilege’ Became a Provocation,"Photo

This spring, the novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie put a new spin on the commencement speech, that most staid of genres. Speaking at Wellesley College, she didn’t emphasize how the graduates had been helped by their education, but how they had been hindered by it. She invoked their privilege — and her own — to describe how ‘‘privilege blinds.’’ As a highly educated woman, she told them, she hadn’t always been alert to the ‘‘nuances’’ of people who were different from her. ‘‘Privilege blinds, because it’s in its nature to blind,’’ she said. ‘‘Don’t let it blind you too often. Sometimes you will need to push it aside in order to see clearly.’’

Adichie was speaking to her audience in their own language. The word ‘‘privilege’’ has become ubiquitous on college campuses — but in her coolness, in her ability to claim her own privilege without anxiety or abjection, she restored some dignity to an overstuffed, overheated word.

‘‘Privilege’’ is as old as society itself and initially referred to wealth: ‘‘We have got to fight against privilege,’’ George Orwell wrote. ‘‘And if the rich squeal audibly, so much the better.’’ But when social scientists began using the word to refer to the unearned benefits afforded a group of people, the term experienced a resurgence. It has prompted flamboyant disputes on cable news, memorably between Jon Stewart and Bill O’Reilly, who debated whether privilege really exists at all. It inspires college students to fire off indignant editorials about how identity politics on campus and a culture of ‘‘checking your privilege’’ — examining how your perspective is shaped by your advantages — is going too far or not far enough. President Obama has been asked if he is doing enough to address white privilege in America. On the Internet, it makes for trusty kindling, and in the popular imagination, a cudgel: When people think of ‘‘privilege’’ being used, it’s almost always as an epithet, to shame.

In the 1930s, W.E.B. Du Bois had an insight that privilege isn’t only about having money — it’s a state of being. He noted a ‘‘psychological wage’’ of whiteness: Poor whites felt that they outranked poor blacks; they could at least vote and access public schools and parks. In 1988, Peggy McIntosh, a women’s studies scholar at Wellesley, expanded on the idea, publishing a list of 46 benefits of being white (for example: ‘‘I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time’’; ‘‘I do not have to educate my children to be aware of systemic racism for their own daily physical protection’’). ‘‘I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage,’’ she wrote, ‘‘but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege, which puts me at an advantage.’’ For many, this idea of privilege was their introduction to thinking about racism not as ‘‘individual acts of meanness,’’ in McIntosh’s words, but as ‘‘invisible systems conferring unsought racial dominance.’’ And for people of color, it was yet another powerful confirmation of their perceptions, their feeling that there were different sets of rules in place. It also made the case that failing to reckon with your privilege meant settling for a partial view of reality — Adichie’s very point.

But the shine has come off this hardy, once-­helpful word. It looks a little worn, a bit blunted, as if it has been taken to too many fights. Instead of clarity, it has sown confusion: ‘‘I’m white, my husband is Latino,’’ one woman commented on a blog post about confronting your privilege. ‘‘We have a Latino last name. Does that mean I lose some of my white privilege?’’ Even those who find it useful in certain contexts say the word swallows too many subtleties and individual variations. ‘‘You need to know that I was privileged,’’ Ta-­Nehisi Coates wrote on his blog for The Atlantic. ‘‘I can run you all kinds of stats on the racial wealth gap and will gladly discuss its origins. But you can’t really buy two parents like I had.’’ My own allegiance to the word is atavistic — growing up, it was one of the few words I had to understand the racism I felt so surrounded and mystified by. But now I find myself wielding the word warily, like the devalued currency it has become — dismissed as jargon or used to hector. The only reliable effect it seems to produce is panic.",REAL
Hiding From Animals,"Two years ago, I was walking with my friend Christina through a park in a small English town when characters I’ve only ever seen in bird hides began to appear: camouflage-clad photographers with 300-millimeter lenses and expressions of urgent concentration. We looked to where the cameras were pointed, and were astonished. Three meters away, two of Britain’s most elusive mammals were swimming in the shallow river running through the park. Otters! They didn’t seem to see us; they certainly didn’t care.

Photo

Their wet flanks gleamed like tar as they rolled in the water. They broke the surface to crunch fish in their sharp white teeth, showering droplets from their stiff whiskers, then slipped back beneath the surface to swim down the river, the photographers chasing them like paparazzi and intermittently running backward because the lenses they’d brought were the wrong ones for such close views. It was thrilling. We followed the otters downstream and stopped by a woman with a toddler and a baby in a stroller, who were watching them, too. She told me she loved these otters. They were part of her town. Part of her local community. They’d eaten all the expensive carp from the fishpond in the big house, she said, amused. Then she tilted her head at the photographers. ‘‘Aren’t they weird?’’ she asked. Outside the hide, they looked faintly ridiculous, so accustomed to their binoculars, camouflage and high-zoom lenses that they felt compelled to use them even when they were unnecessary.

Hides are places designed for watching wildlife, but they are equally rewarding places to watch people who watch wildlife and to study their strange social behavior. One reason I hesitated before entering the little hide is that I was worried there would be other people in it: Walking into a crowded hide is rather like arriving late at a live theatrical performance and trying to find your seat. There are unspoken rules in hides. As in a theater or a library, you are required to be silent, or to speak in a low murmur. Some rules are to prevent animals’ detecting your presence — a general prohibition on telephone calls, slamming the door, extending hands out the window. But others are more curious, stemming from a particular problem: Your job in a hide is to pretend you are not there, and when there is more than one person in the hide, the sense of disembodiment that the trick relies on is threatened. Regular visitors to hides often solve this conundrum spatially. When she started visiting hides for the first time, my friend Christina wondered why people chose to sit at the far edges, leaving the seats with the best view unoccupied. ‘‘I thought it was self-sacrificing English etiquette,’’ she said, ‘‘before I realized that people sat at the far sides of the hide because they wanted to be as far from everyone else as possible.’’

In the hide, there is a constant monitoring of others’ expertise as the inhabitants listen to one another’s muttered conversations about the things outside — and it can be agonizing when they get things wrong. I remember the chill in the air one spring day in Suffolk after a man confidently told his companion that what he was watching was a water vole. Everyone else in the hide knew this lumbering creature with a long tail was a large brown rat. No one said anything. One man coughed. Another snorted. The tension was unbearable. With true British reserve, no one was comfortable correcting his mistake and lessening him in the eyes of his friend. A few people couldn’t bear the atmosphere and left the hide. It is always a relief when you open a hide door and find you are alone.

The uses of hides are as various as their inhabitants. You can sit with a camera hoping for the perfect shot of a passing marsh hawk or owl. You can sit with a proficient naturalist and hear whispered identification tips, or use it as a place to sit down midway through a long walk. Most people sit and scan the view with binoculars for a few minutes before deciding there is nothing of sufficient interest or rarity to keep them there. But there is another kind of hide-watching that I am increasingly learning to love. It is when you embrace the possibility that you will see little or nothing of interest. You literally wait and see. Sitting in the dark for an hour or two and looking at the world through a hole in a wall requires a meditative patience. You have given yourself time to watch clouds drift from one side of the sky to the other and cast moving shadows across 90 minutes of open water. A sleeping snipe, its long bill tucked into pale-tipped scapular feathers and its body pressed against rushes striped with patterns of light and shade, wakes, raises its wings and stretches. A heron as motionless as a marble statue for minutes on end makes a cobra-strike to catch a fish. The longer you sit there, the more you become abstracted from this place, and yet fixed to it. The sudden appearance of a deer at the lake’s shore, or a flight of ducks tipping and whiffling down to splash on sunlit water, becomes treasure, through the simple fact of the passing of time.",REAL
From Yum to Yuck,"Photo

Earlier this year, a video called ‘‘Korean Girls Taste American Snacks’’ appeared online. It featured the reactions of young women as they sampled popular American junk food like Pop-Tarts and s’mores-flavored Goldfish crackers. Most weren’t fans of the tastes and textures — one participant recoiled while eating the Goldfish, saying it was akin to eating ‘‘belly fat.’’ The video attracted millions of viewers, spawning dozens of news articles and enchanting the users of Reddit.

But it wasn’t a one-hit wonder, or a fluke — the video is part of a larger trend of culinary voyeurism that involves coaxing unsuspecting volunteers into trying unfamiliar food items and then filming their bewilderment. The viewing experience is incongruous, like watching a dorm prank pulled off by Anthony Bourdain. In the process, the videos unlock a strange chamber of the human psyche, offering entertainment with a side of schadenfreude — the most successful videos are often the ones in which participants seem horrified by the items they are eating. (A general search for ‘‘Americans trying Vegemite,’’ for example, calls up several homemade clips of kids daring one another to try the dank and salty spread, which is a staple in Australia but an acquired taste in most other places.) These reaction videos have now evolved beyond food: The viral-media powerhouse BuzzFeed seized on the trend and has churned out its own variations in which people are challenged to do something — nearly anything — for the first time, including ‘‘Guys Shave Their Armpits for the First Time’’ and ‘‘Women Wear Stilettos for the First Time.’’

These videos are the descendants of a much older food meme in which toddlers are recorded tasting something intense for the first time — lemons, say — so we can witness their comically grimacing faces. It appears that there’s a universal appeal in watching someone encounter something entirely new and strange, especially if the viewer is already intimately familiar with that experience. Perhaps that’s because this Internet phenomenon works best when it takes our mundane rituals out of their usual context and turns them into an intoxicating spectator sport.",REAL
Philip Zimbardo Thinks We All Can Be Evil,"Photo

In 1971, you conducted a psychological experiment at Stanford. You split your 21 student-subjects into guards and inmates, with you as the superintendent, and had them run a prison out of a basement. You had to abandon the experiment after six days, because it spiraled violently out of control. Now, 44 years later, there is a movie about it. Do you like it? I’m delighted with it. It conveys for the first time to a general public what this kind of experiment is like. There is another movie called ‘‘Experimenter,’’ about Stanley Milgram’s research, which also premiered at Sundance, and the second half is confusing. At one point, Milgram walks out of his lab, and behind him is a huge elephant. I saw the director at Sundance, and I said, ‘‘Why did you have an elephant?’’ He said, ‘‘People like elephants.’’

I had always believed that the Stanford experiment started very professionally, and that in your role as superintendent, you got caught up in it the same way the guards did. But in the movie, it’s as if you were this dark, eerie, almost sadistic figure right from the very beginning. Were you? No. I had a reputation at Stanford. I was one of the most lovable professors there.

The movie makes it seem as though the study was irresponsible — that you were abusive from the very start. Do you worry that this will change what people think of the study? Yeah. If there is a weakness, it’s that there is not a sufficient transformation with my character. You see it in the guards. They start off playing a game, and then there is a point at which they each, one by one, flip and become more and more extreme.

Have any of the prisoners or guards seen the movie yet? No, nobody has.

David Eshleman, one of the most abusive guards, told me that he doesn’t think an evil environment turned him evil. He claims that his motivation was actually to try to please you. He said he was trying to do something good. Everything he created was really off the charts. I mean, he forced the prisoners to simulate sodomy: ‘‘Bend over. You’re a camel. Hump him.’’",REAL
Can I Post a Photo of a Bad Driver?,"Photo

During a torrential downpour one afternoon, my son and I were driving behind a dangerous driver who swerved very carelessly over the median and roadside lines several times. It was clear over the miles we were behind this person that he or she was distracted — and, I suspect, a teenager, based on the type of car. Before the driver turned off the road, I had my son take a photo, which I posted to a local forum on social media. The post said that this driver was dangerous and included the plate number. My goal was to alert others and hopefully let a parent know that his or her teenager was driving recklessly. A controversy erupted, split evenly between those for and against. The police won’t do anything unless they see it happening, so I did not phone them. I could never live with myself if the driver went on to cause an accident and I did nothing. Was my action justified? NAME WITHHELD

Kwame Anthony Appiah: There are two of you in the car, so it’s perfectly safe for one of you to call 911. Somebody really dangerous should be brought to the attention of the police immediately. Of course, they might not do anything, but you should at least give them the opportunity — though only if it’s serious. I do not think we want to live in a world in which people are constantly calling the cops because people are annoying them by driving at 33 miles per hour in a 35-miles-per-hour zone. But this guy does sound as if he was really dangerous.

Amy Bloom: Calling the cops makes sense. I’m not sure if posting on social media is going to help, although I understand the wish to alert people. If you were very narrow about just posting the facts and not jumping to conclusions — either that the driver was a teenager or that this was a pattern, because those are two things that you don’t know — maybe you could just say on your local neighborhood email list, ‘‘I saw this car being driven in this way, and I was concerned about the driver’s safety and that of other drivers.’’ Then you haven’t made any accusations. But when people post on social media in this way, they often open the door to major controversy.

Kenji Yoshino: You could ethically post the facts without going further. In fact, if you do go further, you run the very, very slim chance of being sued for libel. So just the facts, please. That’s also an ethical directive, because you have no broader understanding of the context: This could have been a one-time thing. I have mixed feelings about what has been called digilantism, or vigilantism through digital media, but a way to mitigate it is to also post positive examples of driving. The Internet is a place where negative commentary reigns supreme, but it might be encouraging to do the opposite as well.

Appiah: I’m not a big fan of using social media in this way. There’s no guarantee that there’s any filtering about which complaints are serious and which aren’t. So a lot of the commentary is therefore going to be unfair. Once you are accused of something on the web, nothing might happen or absurdly extensive abuse might occur. I’m just worried, because we don’t want to live in a world where vast quantities of accusations of this sort are circulating.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Summer Fridays,"Photo

It seems far out, but the origins of summer Fridays are shrouded in mystery. No one — not even labor-studies professors — seems to agree on when or where they began. (‘‘What on earth would I know about it?’’ one Ivy League academic, who studied the history of office culture, emailed in response to a query.) Still, each Memorial Day weekend, it begins anew, a tradition as elegant and fragile as a dragon­fly. On Fridays at lunchtime, well-off people in their white shirts dart down from the buildings of Park and Madison Avenues to the tunnels of Penn and Grand Central. The brave go forth to battle the Long Island Expressway, making themselves scarce at noon. (‘‘Beat that traffic, Connor and Katelyn!’’ ‘‘See you at the Sloppy Tuna, Molly and Preston!’’)

New York City grows dimmer as they depart, literally. Power consumption dips in the city on Fridays year-round, but during the summer, the decrease is even more significant: sometimes as much as 4 percent below average. This is practically the only metric I could find suggesting that summer Fridays exist.

The practice seems to center in media and publishing but also intrudes, albeit irregularly, into corners of law and finance. (A 1988 article in The Times revealing the summer work policies of most every book publisher in town captured the practice in its prime.) To be of the class that assumes the observance of summer Fridays speaks of a very specific Manhattan entitlement that would be recognizable to a young Didion or Plath. But summer Fridays really aren’t just for the Cubs and Kittys of the world; they even have some blue-collar history. During the fiscal crisis of 1975, New York City’s municipal workers expressed their willingness to go without their summer hours. The truncated Friday schedule has roots in the labor movement, and its history as a bargained right dates back at least to the 1930s, around the same time, by coincidence, that office buildings began getting air-conditioning.

So beneath the snootiness is an equal opportunity: an Instagram of everyone in clean white bucks and Vineyard Vines; a rainbow coalition of stupid boating hats, with delicate sherbet-colored sweaters for people of all races, creeds and pronoun preferences. It’s yours if you want it: Socklessness and pride! White jeans and enlarged livers! Slingbacks abandoned in the dunes! Summer Fridays smell of life burned hot and salty, of lust and torment, of grilled meats and necessary mistakes. They are the sexy, freckled bare arms of capitalism.

Summer Fridays by publishing house, according to a 1988 Times article: Farrar Straus & Giroux: Yes (half-days)

Harper & Row: None

Henry Holt: Yes (every other Friday off, at the discretion of department heads)

Little, Brown: None

Macmillan: None

Random House: Yes (half-days)

Simon & Schuster: None

St. Martin’s Press: Yes (1988 was its first year observing)

W.W. Norton: Yes (same)

After all, this isn’t just for the Hamptons set. The afternoon train to Speonk stops at Bay Shore and vomits forth the largely straight, post-frat, beer-pong-playing crowds for Ocean Beach, the Kips Bay of Fire Island. Just 15 minutes later, at Sayville, the same train disgorges a whole college of largely not-straight men in exquisite shorts, toting leather duffels and gazing over Tom Ford sunglasses. (‘‘Let’s stop at the Pines Pantry for steaks, Lance and Tanner!’’)

If your surly employer won’t recognize your Friday desires, rise up. Make the Rockaways your Wainscott, make Point Pleasant your Point O’Woods. There is nothing hotter and therefore more summery than to seize and repurpose the habits of your oppressors. Let us all be houseguests in the parlor of privilege. Maybe someday the master’s tools can dismantle the master’s summer house. They may not have one for long.",REAL
Alice Waters’s Perfect Aioli,"Photo

In Berkeley, where I currently live, ‘‘Alice’’ is a one-name celebrity, like Madonna. This is completely justifiable. In her lifetime, there has probably been no more important American in food than Alice Waters.

It was a matter of timing, of course — Alice is not a superwoman. She is, however, a dreamer and an uncompromising visionary. Some 40 years ago, when she settled in Berkeley — she had graduated from the university and then spent many summers in France — she had already recognized that good cooking was not about fancy French ingredients or techniques, but about taking the best local food you could find and not messing it up.

Photo

This seems obvious now, and undoubtedly it was to many people then, but no one else started a homey little restaurant in North Berkeley and determinedly began searching for that food and featuring it, while supporting, encouraging, even nurturing the farmers who produced it. In doing so, she has redefined American cuisine. Then, establishing the Edible Schoolyard Project, which aims to forge meaningful links between schoolchildren and the food on their plates, she set out to make good on her belief that food literacy isn’t just for refined diners.

The menu at that restaurant, Chez Panisse, unlike those of so many of her peers and successors, doesn’t shout, and it doesn’t brag; it assumes that you know this isn’t fancy cooking, this isn’t ‘‘modernist’’ cuisine, this is just the best stuff we know how to put in front of you. That’s why many meals there end with a perfect piece of fruit, or blow your mind with something as simple as watercress dressed with lemon and oil. The food says, ‘‘Yes, of course you could do this at home, and you should.’’

After all the accolades, Alice is still a very good cook, one who stays in close touch with the chefs at Chez Panisse, critiquing their work while also learning from it. She is particular and generous at the same time. (I say this as someone who has nervously cooked for her.)

Almost a year ago, at her house, Alice and I made a lovely dish of salmon baked in fig leaves. While it evokes pure summer in California, it’s easily done almost anywhere. The salmon is king salmon, its season is now and that season coincides perfectly with the ripening of figs in all but the northernmost parts of the country. There is nothing better than a good fig, but typically, Alice exploits the underused leaves, which make a perfect package for the fish, contributing a kind of nutty flavor to it. (The leaves themselves aren’t good to eat.)",REAL
Drink Your Vegetables,"Photo

There used to be a health-­food store right across the street from the bar where I work. You could jaywalk from one place to the other, and one day I watched a man do exactly that. He stepped inside the bar with a big plastic cup of psychedelically green vegetable juice in hand and decisively ordered a shot of well vodka — and an empty pint glass. You can guess the rest. After he slurped down his alcohol-­enhanced kale-­spinach-­apple-­beet special, or whatever it was, he paid for the shot, looked at me and said, ‘‘It’s all about the balance, right?’’

Well, yes and no. I grasped a few truths at that moment. The first was that it would not be long before news ­re­leases flogging kale cocktails would land in my email inbox. The next was that if you had to mix your produce with your liquor, surely there had to be a better way to go about it than simply spiking your green juice with vodka.

That most venerable of boozy salads-­in-­a-­glass, the bloody mary, has been a classic since its creation early in the last century, and deservedly so. I’ve had less satisfying quick lunches than a bloody made in the manner of one of those fanciful Arcimboldo paintings, crowned by as much greenery as a glass can take without toppling.

Lately, I’ve been gravitating more toward its cousin, the bloody maria, which swaps out the vodka for tequila. I like the extra blast of flavor the tequila imparts, and its inherently vegetal nature complements the tomato juice and celery.

But tomatoes certainly are not the only fruit, nor celery the only vegetable. Tequila mingles joyfully with other produce too. Dawn Kinstle, a bartender at Lot 2 in South Slope, Brooklyn — my favorite neighborhood restaurant — devised a cocktail she punningly named the Chícharo Pea-­queño, in which juice from the pods of English peas is combined with tequila, mint, lime and just a touch of salt to bright, refreshing and gorgeously green effect.

I declare my love for sangrita — the bracing blend of juice and spice that frequently accompanies tequila in Mexico — as often and loudly as possible. Traditional versions, made with pomegranate and citrus juices, are terrific. But I’m excited about creative variations I’ve been seeing, like the orange-­hued papaya-­and-­carrot number created by Shannon Ponche of the Brooklyn bar Leyenda. It’s a perfect partner for tequila, and mixed with fresh lime juice and beer, it makes for a particularly piquant and delectable michelada. If sangrita’s not already a regular part of your drinking repertoire, I hope this reci­pe will change that.

The guy at my bar really wasn’t wrong when he said, ‘‘It’s all about the balance.’’ The success or failure of any mixed drink rests upon it. Had I the nerve, or desire, to taste his drink, I suspect I would have wanted to adjust it for acidity, for sweetness, for sourness, for potency. And if you share these impulses, there is no reason not to experiment with virtually any fruit or vegetable when making cocktails. Even kale, that ubiquitous bully of the vegetable world, if you must. But please, only if you must.

An Italian Job,"Tadzio had this vision of a homey New York-style bakery, and he invested in some armchairs to spruce up the place. But our boss was more interested in creating an ethnic restaurant. Every morning Tadzio and I would show up at 6:30 to set up the armchairs and settees, and every evening the boss would toss them back outside so he could make space for extra dining tables.

On a typical day, I would start off by making some brioches and slicing fruit, putting together some sandwiches, the little things you sell for breakfast. The place was actually quite nice; a lot of people came in for lunch because the prices were so low. It was the two of us, Tadzio and I, in the kitchen, and we spent all day together, so we talked all the time. We were a team.

One afternoon, two police inspectors came in. In Italy, we don’t just have the police; we have the police, the carabinieri (military police), the vigili urbani (municipal police) and the ones from the Azienda Sanitaria Locale (the health department). Naturally, one of these officers was tall and the other short, one was skinny and the other fat. It was a terrible cliché. And they walked right in with this manner that’s so typical of the police, and of people in the Mafia, come to think of it. (In Sicily, you learn about that early on.)

The inspectors had a vaguely disgusted air, and they began rummaging through the fridge, poking at things. They just opened stuff, checked it, did whatever they wanted. Tadzio was behind the counter making cakes when they asked him for the restaurant license. He had no idea where the license was, or if there even was one.

The police would have loved to issue a citation right then and there, but the problem was, everything in the cafe was citation-worthy: We used the pizza oven for pastries, and the stovetop didn’t have the right certifications. We didn’t have any uniforms. We were all being paid under the table. One employee may not have had papers. Everything was clean, but from an official point of view, we were way out of line. When they left, they said, ‘‘Goodbye, we’ll see you soon,’’ which to Italian ears was like a threat and a promise. That’s when I knew that a thousand branches of bureaucratic authority would begin parading through the restaurant. And I thought, I’m already broke; if I have to get into legal trouble over this gig, I would rather leave.

So that job was kind of a disaster. But I discovered that I really like working as a cook. It’s like acting: You’re onstage everyday, but it’s always new. Pretty soon after I left, Tadzio left as well. He found work in a vegan place inside an organic store, and then he helped me get a job there too, replacing a guy who decided he needed to find himself in India. So we’re back together again, working as a team.",REAL
How to Proselytize,"Photo

‘‘Your appearance matters,’’ says Mario Dias, who manages the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints training center in São Paulo, Brazil, which each year prepares 3,500 young Mormons from all over the world for one-and-a-half-to-two-year missions in the country. A conservative look suits a serious message (faux-hawks and mullets are explicitly prohibited for Mormon missionaries, as are above-the-knee skirts). ‘‘Do not be intimidated or judgmental,’’ Dias says. As a door-to-door evangelist, you will see all kinds of people, from ‘‘drunkards on the road to the richest men you’ve ever met.’’ Approach them with respect and treat them with love.

Beware beginner’s zeal. New missionaries can be overconfident and too focused on the numbers. ‘‘You can’t go out thinking, I’m here to bring as many people as I can into the church,’’ Dias says. Before you start on Gospel matters, connect with people as humans. Ask about their families, their lives, their troubles.

Raised as a Catholic, Dias was baptized as a Mormon at 18, three months after he began meeting with missionaries. During his own two-year mission, he converted 70 people and talked to an estimated 3,100. He once converted a woman after just a single verbal exchange, but on average, the process took a month. If you have a personal conversion experience, talk about it. People like transformation narratives. Don’t be pedantic and don’t speak to strangers as if it’s your job to instruct them. Instead, ‘‘share the joy of your belief,’’ says Dias, who is 47.

In unfamiliar territory, carry a map so you don’t get lost or accidentally knock on a door someone has shut in your face before. Take careful notes. You might be in continuing theological or personal discussions with dozens of people at the same time. So you must remember details to be able to pick up where you left off. ‘‘Write down, for example, ‘Today I talked about the purpose of life with this guy here named John,’ ’’ Dias says. Because there is no playbook for how to approach different types of people, read situations as they arise: Decipher if someone is receptive; determine when to offer baptism. ‘‘If someone seems curious,’’ Dias says, ‘‘that’s always a good sign.’’",REAL

RE: ARIANNA HUFFINGTON

David Segal profiled Arianna Huffington, who has done more than anyone else to invent the Internet news business.

The article makes The Huffington Post resemble a content mill out of a Fritz Lang film, and Huffington herself looks like a neurotic phony who doesn’t know how to use a web browser, but the whole thing still somehow comes off as too generous. The content-industry takeaway was that if you can’t turn a profit with writers churning out 1,200 garbage posts a day, how on earth will anyone else survive? This is built on the bedrock economic fact that a giant pile of trash is more valuable than a small pile of trash, which also explains New York. Rusty Foster, posted in Today in Tabs, an Internet newsletter

One [HuffPost employee] needs to quit and get working on ‘‘The Detoxer Wears Prada.’’ It would be hilarious. Of course, there’s nothing surprising about the fact that one of America’s most powerful liberals is innovating the worst possible working conditions in America. All these content sites are insane and caught in a race to the bottom of the sea. A comment on Hollywood Elsewhere

As the human resources director for The Huffington Post, I feel compelled to address some of the allegations from anonymous former employees in David Segal’s article. I have been in my position for four years and view my role as a sounding board for our employees across the globe. Never has any staff member — current or former — told me about having to get a second job to cover living expenses. In fact, our entry-level salaries are very much on par with digital-­media and traditional-­media organizations in New York City, and even entry-level salaried employees receive a 7.5 percent annual bonus. Furthermore, HuffPost prides itself on being a place where people can and do advance quickly; our newsroom leadership is just one testament to this culture.

In addition, I have never heard of any HuffPost employee developing an ulcer. As the H.R. representative for the company, it would surely have come to my attention if an employee had a health issue that was related to the work environment. We take these matters very seriously and would have taken necessary measures to accommodate such a situation. Twyla Perrin, Human Resources Director, The Huffington Post

Nicholas Dawidoff explored the life of Robert Frank, the influential photographer.

Thanks so much for the Robert Frank article. Like a lot of folks my age (57), I really never comprehended Frank’s work. ‘‘The Americans’’ documented my parents’ world rather than mine, and not a version they would recognize or acknowledge. But the Times profile demonstrates how artless Frank’s art truly was; now I can see the resemblance to the droll and deadpan contemporary work of people like Alec Soth. Not hostile; sympathetic in its own way; just relentlessly unsentimental. A comment on the Online Photographer

I enjoyed this article as a narrative about life as an artist. It reminds me of certain seemingly banal but often forgotten truths: about the unresolved competition in each person’s life between duty and desire or one goal and another, and about the differing time required for any particular metaphorical flower to exhibit its full bloom. Randy Adams, Los Angeles, on nytimes.com

Robert Frank showed us who we were/are as a people, and sadly the truth remains that we have done too little to improve the lives of all Americans. If he were to travel the United States today, he would still find too many similar faces, places and situations like those in 1955 and 1956, and, to quote Bob Dylan, ‘‘how many deaths will it take till he knows/that too many people have died.’’ But Frank showed us our flaws and weaknesses and imperfections and challenged us all.

The Mixed-Up Brothers of Bogotá,"The following Monday at Strycon, Laura told Jorge about her funny misunderstanding with his double at the butcher counter. Jorge laughed and told her that he did have a twin, named Carlos, but that they looked nothing like each other.

At that moment, Jorge had before him sufficient evidence to suggest that his life was not what he thought it was, that his family was not what he thought it was. But there is a saying that Carlos, a man of many sayings, sometimes applied to Jorge: ‘‘The blindest man is the one who does not want to see.’’

Slide Show

The Photo, The Truth

A month later, Laura told Janeth that there was an opening in the drafting department at Strycon, and Janeth landed the job. Soon after, she saw Jorge for the first time and immediately understood Laura’s confusion at the butcher counter. The two men had the same soft brown eyes. Same bouncy, feet-­splayed walk. Same bright, flashy smile. She didn’t feel as though she knew Jorge well enough to bring the resemblance up with him, but she did show William a photo of Jorge; William laughed and showed it around the butcher shop but chalked it up to coincidence.

After six months, Janeth left Strycon for another job, but even then, whenever she and her boyfriend ran into William, she wondered if she should have told Jorge about his double. That question tugged at her until finally, on Sept. 9, 2014, a slow day at her new job, Janeth texted Laura an image of William to show Jorge.

Laura went upstairs to piping to get Jorge’s reaction to the photo. Jorge, smiling, took a look at her phone. He swore. ‘‘That’s me!’’ he said. He stared at the image.

William was wearing a yellow Colombian soccer jersey, practically a national uniform on the day of big matches. Jorge often wore one just like it, which made it all the more apparent just how thoroughly the young man in the photo looked like him. A friend was walking by Jorge’s desk, and Jorge flagged him down for a second opinion.

‘‘Tell me what you think of this photo,’’ he told his friend, handing him the phone.

You look fine, the friend said.

‘‘Except it’s not me,’’ Jorge said. He could not stop staring at Laura’s phone.

Jorge gave up on getting any work done. He sat down with Laura in the office kitchen so they could talk. Maybe his father, who was never more than an occasional visitor to their home, had another child he never mentioned. Jorge started flipping through more of William’s Facebook images, now on his own phone. Uneasily, he noted one of William in a butcher’s smock, looking just the way Jorge did on the rare days he had to wear a lab coat. He glanced at a picture of William holding a shot glass, a friend by his side.

Jorge moved to his desktop computer so he could see the images more closely. He clicked once more on the photo of William and the friend holding shot glasses. Now that the image was large, he could examine what he had failed, incredibly, to notice when he looked at the photo on his phone. He leaned in close, his nose practically touching the screen. The man’s hair was slicked up like a rooster’s crown, and the shirt was all wrong. But there was the full lower lip and thick brown hair that Jorge knew well. The buttons on the man’s shirt were straining slightly at the hint of a potbelly, in a way that was intimately familiar. Jorge felt a rush of confusion, and then his stomach dropped. The friend sitting next to his double had a face that Jorge knew better than his own: It was the face of his fraternal twin brother, Carlos.

Jorge And Carlos

After work that day, Jorge walked as usual to the small university he attended at night, staring all the while at the images on his phone. After class, he took a bus home, where he planned to tell Carlos about the day’s events.

Growing up, Carlos was the twin who aced the homework and Jorge the twin who copied it. Now they were each doing well; Carlos worked at an accounting firm during the day and was also completing a degree at night. The small but comfortable two-­bedroom duplex they shared in a middle-­class neighborhood was already a step up from their childhood home. Their mother, a housekeeper, raised them and their older sister, Diana, in one small room of a house in Bogotá that their grandmother owned. They never considered themselves deprived; they crammed a television and a refrigerator into that room, and the public schools in their neighborhood were good. But they had more now — Jorge could travel to soccer matches, Carlos could go clubbing — and it pained all three siblings that their mother, who died of stomach cancer four years earlier, had not lived long enough that they could give her a better life.

As he rode the bus home, Jorge tried to decide what, exactly, he would say to Carlos. He had already told Diana about the photos. ‘‘Just don’t tease Carlos about it,’’ she said.

At home, Jorge found his brother on the phone, as usual, with a woman. Jorge told him to hang up.

‘‘Stop annoying me,’’ Carlos told him. This was their dynamic: Carlos bristling, and Jorge, pestering, joking and darting around him, never letting up. The angrier Carlos would get, the funnier it all was to Jorge.

Finally, Carlos finished his call. Jorge decided he would try to keep the mood light. He opened with a question: ‘‘What would you say if I told you I had an identical twin?’’ Carlos did not look amused.

Jorge tried again: ‘‘Do you believe in telenovelas?’’

Carlos was losing patience. If Jorge had something to tell him, he should just come out with it. Jorge sat Carlos down in front of the laptop in his bedroom and started clicking on photos, showing him the one of William in the Colombia jersey and others at the butcher shop. Carlos laughed alongside him, giddy with the strangeness of the similarity. Then Jorge clicked on the photo of William alongside Carlos’s double, shot glasses in hand.

Unlike Jorge, whose first reaction to the photo was to lean in and stare, Carlos snapped back as if something had pushed him, hard, in the chest. ‘‘Who are they?’’ he asked. He was furious.

Photo

Jorge told him everything he learned from Janeth and Laura that day.The young men in the photo were raised on a remote farm in Santander, a mostly rural region to the north, whose locals were caricatured by other Colombians for their hot tempers and attachment to their guns. According to Facebook, they were born, as were Jorge and Carlos, in late December 1988.

Perhaps, Jorge said, there had been some kind of a mix-up at the hospital — a nurse who accidentally swapped one baby from one set of identical twins with a baby from another pair. He did not say what that would mean: that either he or Carlos was born to another mother. That they were probably not twins at all — not even biologically related. Nor did either of them acknowledge what both knew: If someone had been accidentally placed in their family, it was almost certainly Carlos.

That Carlos never looked liked Jorge and Diana was obvious. His siblings shared their mother’s more delicate frame, her high cheekbones, her eyes. Carlos was taller, solidly built, with a wider nose and a heavier brow. The contrast was not merely physical: Carlos had always felt like an outlier in his family, although he preferred to think of himself as independent. As a child, Carlos had no interest in joining the elaborate games of make-­believe that his mother and siblings played, the funny voices they each put on, playacting for hours. Since their mother died, he checked in with Diana far less often than Jorge did. He was the only one in his family who cared about fashion, and God knows he was the only one who could dance. Carlos and Jorge had always assumed that Carlos took after their father, but they did not know him well enough to be sure.

Carlos’s sense of distance, however, had not diminished his attachment to his mother. He had always adored her; she was strong if not exactly tough — when he and Jorge fought, she would hit them with a fluffy house slipper, which inevitably made them laugh, possibly her intended result. As meager as her resources had been, she made sure that each child could go to a good school and instilled in them the sense of a limitless future. Carlos credited her with all he had achieved so far.

Sitting beside Jorge in his bedroom, Carlos shut the laptop and fell silent. He headed into his room and closed the door. Jorge followed him, saying things that Carlos knew were meant to make him feel better — no matter what, even if one of us was exchanged, we’re still brothers — but that made him feel only more isolated. ‘‘Look,’’ he told Jorge, ‘‘let’s just drop it.’’ He told Jorge never to bother him with the subject again.

That night, Carlos barely slept. He couldn’t make sense of any of it. How could his mother not have been the one to carry him — to create him? He had grieved for her once; now he grieved again, as if losing her a second time. He felt unmoored, powerless, alone.

Down the hall, Jorge slept like a child.

William and Wilber

The next day, soon after William opened the butcher shop, his cousin Brian — Janeth’s boyfriend — arrived for his 12-hour shift. William, who had quickly been promoted to manager of the shop, was happy to hire Brian, a part-time student. He felt closer, in many ways, to Brian than he did to his fraternal twin brother, Wilber. Brian grew up in Bogotá, and when William first arrived in the capital in 2009, the two cousins spent long days baking and selling corn cakes on the street, in the rain, in the heat, passing the time making their customers and themselves laugh. William and Wilber could never spend that many hours together without getting on each other’s nerves. When Wilber later worked for William at the butcher shop, it irked William that his brother was always cleaning up when he should have been waiting on customers and that he resisted William’s authority; Wilber was moody, William thought, and could never take a joke.

As Brian and William set up the shop, Brian explained that the previous evening, Janeth showed him photos that were very confusing, of young men who looked just like Wilber and William. William was amused, intrigued. He remembered that Janeth had shown him that photo of his double months back. But this coincidence sounded even stranger. He texted Janeth and asked to see the photos. As soon as the first one arrived, William let out a scream — ‘‘Ahiii!’’ — and then laughed.

Maybe, Janeth suggested to William by text, either he or his brother had been sick and was brought from Santander to a hospital in Bogotá. William got in touch with an aunt, who told him that, yes, he had been sent to a hospital in Bogotá right after he was born. He and Wilber were delivered at just 28 weeks, and William had digestive problems. The aunt said he was treated at the Materno Infantil in the city.

He passed this along to Janeth, who said that she would try to find out from Jorge where he was born. If Jorge was delivered at the Materno Infantil, Janeth texted, it would be clear: There must have been a swap.

Until that moment, William, like Janeth, had been caught up in the fun and suspense of piecing together the information. But now a wave of anxiety swept over him. He had always looked different from his family and wanted different things — a life bigger than the farm. But he never considered the possibility that he might actually be different — that he might not be theirs. He looked around at the butcher shop; he could barely take in the oblivious customers, the hunks of bloodied flesh, his concerned cousin. He walked out of the store, heading upstairs to his third-floor apartment in the same building. From there, he compulsively texted Janeth to see if she had any information about the name of the hospital where Jorge was born.

A few minutes later, William stumbled back into the shop and showed Brian a text from Janeth. Jorge and Carlos were, in fact, delivered at Materno Infantil. ‘‘Confirmed,’’ William said. Then he sat on a bench in the back of the shop and broke into heaving sobs. Every thought tumbled into another equally painful one. He had been snatched from his rightful place. He was a missing person no one had known to miss. How would he tell his mother? She had six children, but he was the one who sent her money. He was the one who worried about her when she was sick and who tried, when he was young, to cheer her up if she was blue, smothering her with hugs and kisses and biting her gently on her ears to make her laugh. The news, he knew, would break her heart; it was already breaking his.

William had spoken to his mother harshly only once, a few years earlier. He had just finished serving in the military and had served well, winning, among 92 soldiers in his platoon, a top prize that guaranteed him a scholarship to petty-­officer training, a leadership track that would provide him with an education and a significant jump in status. It turned out, however, that the military could not give him the scholarship after all; his parents had taken him out of school when he was 12, and he did not have the equivalent of a high-school diploma. ‘‘You should have let me go to school,’’ he yelled at his mother when he was home in Santander. The closest high school was a five-hour walk away, so the family would have needed money to house him, plus money for uniforms and entrance fees, while also incurring the cost of losing his labor on the farm. Even still, William felt that his mother should have found a way, been resourceful, fought with everything she had. He would have fought for it himself, but at 12, what could he have done?

As he wept on the bench, he was experiencing the first wash of feelings that he would be able to articulate only in time: his sense of his mother’s guilt and worry; the lost opportunity to grow up going to school in Bogotá, instead of working in the fields, hauling crops; his grief over how different he had always felt from the rest of his family, a family who loved him but nonetheless teased him for not quite fitting in. Brian, stunned, sitting beside him on the bench, did not know what to say. There was no ready language for a situation like this. After about 10 minutes, to Brian’s relief, William stopped crying and stood up. William knew how to work, so that is what he would do. They went back inside and started cleaning the counter, putting away utensils, waiting for their next customers.

Eventually, William texted Wilber, who was working at a different butcher shop that day, and told him he needed to come right away. When Wilber arrived later that afternoon, William said he had to show him something and clicked, on his phone, on a photo of Jorge and Carlos. Immediately, Wilber saw, with total clarity, what it took everyone else hours to grasp.

‘‘So we were swapped,’’ Wilber said, shrugging, annoyed by the sense of momentousness William seemed to want to attach to the photo. ‘‘I don’t care who they are. You’re my brother, and you’ll be my brother until the day I die.’’

Face To Face

Every so often, sometimes within hours of conception but usually several days later, the forces that bind newly dividing cells, holding them into one coherent mass, somehow give way. Instead of clinging together in a cluster that will form one person months later and eventually one self, those dividing cells split into two independent entities, each with its own furiously dividing cells. They are separate but the same, with every nucleus of every cell carrying identical DNA. Identical twins start their lives as fluke accidents, a wondrous result of a systemic glitch.

The formation of fraternal twins is far more mundane. Two separate sperm meet two different eggs, creating a litter of two. Fraternal twins are no more genetically alike than any other two siblings, their only trick one of simultaneity: They are conceived and born at roughly the same time.

The four young men in Bogotá had each been raised as a fraternal twin, an identity in and of itself. Now, they realized, they were each an identical twin, part of a matched pair. Even before the four brothers met, each was already, unknowingly, aligning himself with the sibling with whom he shared a womb. Carlos and Wilber were cautious, convinced that no one should pursue the matter any further — who knew what trouble these people could bring. William and Jorge, however, were open to the possibility of an encounter. Within hours of the revelation, Janeth had arranged for William and Jorge to meet in a public square at 9 that evening, soon after William closed up the butcher shop.

Wilber, initially averse to meeting the other brothers, felt increasingly curious as he looked at the pictures; he wanted to go, too. Around 3 p.m., William spoke to Jorge for the first time and asked if he could invite Wilber, along with Brian and Janeth. He was relieved when Jorge said yes. Both noticed that their voices did not sound alike. William’s was huskier, and of course there was the Santander accent. William also called Jorge ‘‘sir,’’ a formality typical of people from the countryside. Jorge thought he liked this person’s voice; he sounded not just nice, but good.

As the hour grew closer, William went quiet from nerves. He took off from work to get a haircut. He put on his best sweater, which is black with gray stripes. He strapped on his gun, which he wore as a matter of course ever since he served in the military. He paced.

Across town, Jorge was also feeling jittery. He had asked his brother to go with him, but Carlos had a date he was not willing to cancel. When Jorge ran into a friend from the university, he spontaneously asked him to join him for moral support.

At the appointed time, Jorge stood in the square, looking around. His palms were damp, and he could hardly breathe from the sensation of pressure he felt in his stomach. Within minutes, a group started walking toward him. There was William — with Jorge’s face, walking just as Jorge did, with that roll and the funny spread of his feet.

Brian filmed the encounter on his phone. With the sound turned off, the nervous chatter muted, the video captures Jorge and William engaging in what looks like some kind of a highly choreographed, ritualized pantomime. William stares at Jorge, as Jorge looks off to the side; then William turns his head away, as if intuitively giving Jorge the chance to stare at his face, which he does, looking him up and down. The two stare directly at each other — there’s a moment of eye contact that is shockingly intimate, and an exchange of smiles — and then they each look quickly away. As they keep stealing glimpses of each other, they look the way lovers might when they are on the brink of confessing, for the first time, to a mutual infatuation. Jorge pulls himself together, looks at William a bit more appraisingly; Jorge is chewing gum, and his jaw is working hard. He puts his hand on his cheek, pressing his own flesh: Yes, this is me. That person over there, that is him. William is quiet, shifting his weight so that he appears to be swaying from side to side. (‘‘It was like staring through a mirror, and on the other side of the mirror, there’s a parallel universe,’’ Jorge would say later.)

Video

It was easier, clearly, for Jorge to turn his gaze to Wilber, the double of Carlos. Jorge stares at Wilber and shakes his head. Wilber had seen the photos of Carlos, who wore glasses. ‘‘All I need are the glasses!’’ Wilber said. He let out a high-­pitched giggle, and Jorge felt that pressure in his chest again: That was Carlos’s laugh.

Having seen how much William looked like Jorge, Wilber was now eager to meet Carlos. Jorge called ahead to say they were coming, and the group piled into two taxis, heading over to Jorge and Carlos’s apartment.

Around 10, Carlos heard the doorbell ring. He walked to the door and then stood there, paralyzed: He could barely bring himself to answer. He knew it was Jorge and those men from the photos. Those people were not just strangers; they were stranger than strangers, players in a story about his life over which he had little control.

‘‘Open the door!’’ Jorge commanded. Carlos heard a giggle: It was his own, but it was not coming from him, or maybe it was.

‘‘I don’t want to,’’ Carlos said. ‘‘I’m scared.’’ The moments ticked by, then two, with Carlos laughing nervously on one side, Wilber laughing on the other. ‘‘Carlos, open it!’’ Jorge told him again. You cannot block the sun with one finger, their mother used to say.

Carlos opened the door, and the group filed in, like a procession from a dream. There was Jorge, and there was his double — it was Jorge in a strange sweater; Jorge, only quiet; Jorge without the cool confidence. There was some woman, and some other guy. And then there he was — Carlos was staring at himself, an altered version of himself, a funny photocopy, a joke, a nightmare.

Carlos looked at Wilber, his mirror image. They took a quick peek at each other — they both shouted ‘‘Ay!’’ and turned their backs, covering their eyes, each turning red. Wilber started speaking, but Carlos was having a hard time catching what he was saying. Instead of rolling his R’s, Wilber spoke with hard D’s. The speech impediment! Carlos had one as a child but overcame it with speech therapy.

All four started comparing notes, quizzing one another, finding out which essential qualities the identical twins shared. Who were the crybabies of the family? Carlos and Wilber! Who had sweet temperaments? Jorge and William! Who were more organized? Carlos and Wilber! Who were the girl-­chasers? Carlos and Wilber! Who were the strongest? Jorge and William!

Even still, while Jorge was seeing sameness with every glance he stole at William, Carlos was seeking differences between him and his country double. ‘‘Look at our hands,’’ Carlos said. ‘‘They’re not the same.’’ Wilber’s were bigger, more swollen, marked with scars from countless quarrels with the knives of the butcher shop and the machetes he used in the fields growing up. Carlos, by contrast, frequently got manicures; his nails, as is not uncommon among male professionals in Colombia, were covered in clear gloss.

William asked Jorge about Jorge’s biological mother: How was she? Where was she? Watching William’s face carefully, Jorge told him that their mother died of cancer four years before. He showed him a photo of her as a young woman: long hair clipped back, beautiful eyes set in a kind, serious face. Staring at the photo, William was struck with a new blow of grief; he did not speak for several minutes.

For most of the evening, the energy in the apartment was positive and giddy. The young men were enjoying themselves, reveling in the hilarious, specific similarities that were easier to spot than the differences. But for each of them, poised and waiting on the other side of the door was a profound feeling of loss: lost time with parents and siblings, lost opportunities, lost years, lost creation myths. Jorge seemed determined to make sure those feelings were kept at bay, at least for the time being. ‘‘All that has happened,’’ he said to the group, ‘‘is that our families have gotten bigger.’’ Someone called out: ‘‘Favorite soccer team?’’ All four shouted the name of a popular Colombian club team: ‘‘Atletico Nacional!’’

Around midnight, the visitors left, promising to meet again soon. Jorge and Carlos stared at each other in the empty living room. Everything was the same; everything was different. ‘‘So what do we do?’’ Carlos asked. Jorge saw that Carlos had started to cry. Carlos walked over to Jorge to wrap him in a close hug. ‘‘I want to be your brother,’’ he said.

PART 2

When Two Are Like One

Identical twins don’t make obvious evolutionary sense; fraternal twins at least have the benefit of genetic diversity, improving the odds that at least one might survive whatever misfortune comes their way. And yet, in their utter inexplicability, identical twins have helped elucidate our most basic understanding of why, and how, we become who we are. By studying the overlap of traits in fraternal twins (who share, on average, 50 percent of their genes) and the overlap of those traits in identical twins (who share 100 percent of their genes), scientists have, for more than a century, been trying to tease out how much variation within a population can be attributed to heredity and how much to environment. ‘‘Twins have a special claim upon our attention,’’ wrote Sir Francis Galton, a British scientist who in the late 19th century was the first to compare twins who looked very much alike with those who did not (although science had not yet distinguished between identical and fraternal pairs). ‘‘It is, that their history affords means of distinguishing between the effects of tendencies received at birth, and those that were imposed by the special circumstances of their after lives.’’

Galton, who was Darwin’s cousin, is at least as well known for coining the term ‘‘eugenics’’ as he is for his innovative analysis of twins (having concluded, partly from his research, that healthy, intelligent people should be given incentives to breed more). His scientific successor, Hermann Werner Siemens, a German dermatologist, in the early 1920s conducted the first studies of twins that bear remarkable similarity to those still conducted today. But he also drew conclusions that for decades contaminated the strain of research he pioneered; he supported Hitler’s arguments in favor of ‘‘racial hygiene.’’ In seeking genetic origins for various traits they considered desirable or undesirable, these researchers seemed to be treading dangerously close to the pursuit of a master race.

Despite periods of controversy, twins studies proliferated. Over the last 50 years, some 17,000 traits have been studied, according to a meta-­analysis led by Tinca Polderman, a Dutch researcher, and Beben Benyamin, an Australian, and published this year in the journal Nature Genetics. Researchers have claimed to divine a genetic influence in such varied traits as gun ownership, voting preferences, homosexuality, job satisfaction, coffee consumption, rule enforcement and insomnia. Virtually wherever researchers have looked, they have found that identical twins’ test results are more similar than those of fraternal twins. The studies point to the influence of genes on almost every aspect of our being (a conclusion so sweeping that it indicates, to some scientists, only that the methodology must be fatally flawed). ‘‘Everything is heritable,’’ says Eric Turkheimer, a behavioral geneticist at the University of Virginia. ‘‘The more genetically related a pair of people are, the more similar they are on any other outcome of interest’’ — whether it be personality, TV watching or political leaning. ‘‘But this can be true without there being some kind of specific mechanism that is driving it, some version of a Huntington’s-­disease gene. It is based on the complex combined effects of an unaccountable number of genes.’’

Arguably the most intriguing branch of twins research involves a small and unusual class of research subjects: identical twins who were reared apart. Thomas Bouchard Jr., a psychologist at the University of Minnesota, began studying them in 1979, when he first learned of Jim and Jim, two Ohio men reunited that year at age 39. They not only looked remarkably similar, but had also vacationed on the same Florida beach, married women with the same first name, divorced those women and married second wives who also shared the same name, smoked the same brand of cigarette and built miniature furniture for fun. Similar in personality as well as in vocal intonation, they seemed to have been wholly formed from conception, impervious to the effects of parenting, siblings or geography. Bouchard went on to research more than 80 identical-­twin pairs reared apart, comparing them with identical twins reared together, fraternal twins reared together and fraternal twins reared apart. He found that in almost every instance, the identical twins, whether reared together or reared apart, were more similar to each other than their fraternal counterparts were for traits like personality and, more controversial, intelligence. One unexpected finding in his research suggested that the effect of a pair’s shared environment — say, their parents — had little bearing on personality. Genes and unique experiences — a semester abroad, an important friend — were more influential.

As pure science, the study of twins reared apart has troubled some researchers. Those twins either self-­select and step forward or become known to researchers through media reports — which are less inclined to cover identical twins who do not look remarkably alike, who did not marry and divorce women of the same name or choose the same obscure hobby. Identical twins who do not look remarkably alike, of course, are also less likely to be spotted and reunited in the first place. And few studies of twins, whether reared apart or reared together, have included twins from extremely different backgrounds.

‘‘Every study will have its critics,’’ says Nancy Segal, a professor at California State University, Fullerton, who worked with Bouchard from 1982 to 1991. ‘‘But studying twins reared apart separates genetic and environmental effects on behavior better than any research design I know.’’

Segal has been studying Chinese twins (fraternal and identical pairs reared together and reared apart) since 2003. In several books about twins, Segal has merged science with human-­interest tales, walking readers through statistical evidence but also highlighting anecdotal details: the identical twins reared apart who each showed up for research wearing seven rings, or the reared-­apart sisters who rubbed their noses the same way and called it ‘‘squidging.’’

Last October, Yesika Montoya, a Colombian psychologist who is now a social worker at Columbia University, saw on Facebook a video clip from a Colombian newsmagazine program, Séptimo Día, which confirmed through DNA testing that the four young men were two sets of identical twins. She got in touch with Segal, whom she knew only by reputation. She then approached the young men, who agreed to be the subject of their research.

No matter how fascinating, the two sets of twins represent a sample of only two. But to Segal, the possibilities were dizzying, unique. In no other family she knew of were there so many kinds of twin pairings to analyze and compare: Jorge and Carlos, Jorge and William, Jorge and Wilber and so on. ‘‘It’s an experiment within an experiment,’’ she said, comparing it to one of those Russian dolls: Crack open one, and there would still be another, and another, and another.

The twins knew the research would require them to submit, over the course of a week in March, to several probing interviews, individually and in pairs, as well as hours holed up in a conference room filling out questionnaires. There would be questions about their homes, lives and education, as well as personality and intelligence tests. Segal told them that she was interested in writing a book about them (Montoya would later collaborate with her), and the young men were enthusiastic subjects.

William had only one condition for his participation: He insisted that Segal and Montoya visit the home in which he grew up in Santander. Without that, he thought, they could never really understand who he was. He did worry, however, that if he told Segal and Montoya how long it would take to get to Santander, they would never agree to go. So he dodged and evaded whenever the subject of travel time came up. It’s a four- or five-hour drive, William would say, and then add, almost as an afterthought, that when the road could get them no closer to their destination, they would get out and walk. For how long? A little while, William would say; it might be a little muddy. How muddy? Maybe, he would suggest, it would be easier if at that point Segal traveled by horse. Would she, by any chance, rather ride a horse? Segal, a woman in her early 60s who grew up in the Bronx, said no.

The Importance of Will

Around 9:30 a.m. on March 29, three cars pulled into La Paz, a dusty town whose few small streets offer sweeping views of the Andes. The group — Segal, Montoya, the two sets of twins, translators and assorted friends and family members — had already been on the road for six hours. They settled in for a traditional breakfast of bone broth and hot chocolate at a diner in town. Jorge and William sat next to each other along one side of a wooden table, while Carlos sat across the way. Wilber sat with Segal and Montoya. While everyone ate breakfast, Carlos took out his phone and called up a picture of him and Jorge. ‘‘I love my brother, even though I only show it when I’m drunk,’’ Carlos said. ‘‘See?’’ In the picture, Carlos was puckered up, giving Jorge a big kiss on the cheek.

William watched Carlos, feeling annoyed. Wilber, he had often thought, was the same way: He took William entirely for granted, showing his love only on very rare occasions — when, for example, he thought one of them could die. They served in the same platoon in the military, and when they entered a particularly dangerous zone, Wilber would say to him, white-­faced: ‘‘May God be with you, my brother. I love you.’’ William knew Wilber loved him; but both Jorge and William wished that the brothers they grew up with had been more supportive, more expressive — the way William and Jorge now were with each other. They often called each other right before they fell asleep, just to say good night.

The four young men all knew one another well by then. Over the past six months, they had gone on outings and shared meals, talked about women, family, money, values. Even weeks in, each had stared, still unnerved and amazed, into the eyes of his identical brother. They had measured, assessed and inspected. They stood back to back, comparing height (those raised in the city were taller than those from the country); Carlos had crushed Wilber in a food-­eating contest, William had vanquished them all when they arm-­wrestled. In the stands at a soccer match, Carlos watched, in fascination, as William’s hand reached down his jeans to scratch his backside: Jorge did the same thing, Carlos told Wilber. Over dinner one night, Jorge noted that Carlos and Wilber both leaned in at the same odd angle toward their plates. Jorge felt comfortable gently correcting his identical twin’s grammar; Carlos took seriously such brotherly responsibilities as instructing Wilber in how to approach an attractive Bogotá woman at a bar or how to down a shot of tequila. The twins from Santander were amazed that neither of their city counterparts had ever fired a gun, which they quickly remedied on a visit to the country.

Carlos did feel immediately at ease with his newfound twin, he had to admit. Wilber did not try to tell him what to do when he talked about his love life, the way Jorge did; he just listened and supported him. Yes, they understood each other: their manly pride around women, their furious response to their brothers’ incessant teasing. But Carlos was also unnerved by Wilber’s Carlosness. His twin’s very existence refuted a concept dear to him: his sense of his own uniqueness. Having grown up so different from his other family members, he had come to pride himself on his individualism; now, as an identical twin, he was part of a rare subset of humans whose replicability was embarrassingly on display. Once, Wilber posted on Facebook a picture of himself back in Santander, bare-­chested in a river, triumphantly holding two chickens he had just killed. With his hair wet and slicked down like Carlos’s, the campesino in the picture looked too much like Carlos for his comfort. ‘‘Take that thing down,’’ he told Wilber. ‘‘People will think it’s me.’’

Far from believing that he had found his perfect other half, Carlos felt lonelier than ever. For all of Jorge’s reassurances, he could feel Jorge drifting toward William. The two now wore the same sneakers, shaved their goatees the same way. On weekends, Jorge often went to William’s butcher shop and got behind the counter, waiting on customers, so he could spend time with his twin. He sometimes slept at Wilber and William’s tiny apartment, while Carlos slept at home. Sometimes Carlos told himself, with a strange twisted relief, that he was glad this had all happened after his mother died; the jealousy he would have felt had she embraced William as Jorge had would have been more than he could take.

Carlos knew that Jorge was attuned to his sadness, that he even wanted to help. But whenever they tried to talk about it, they fell into mutually irritating old patterns. Carlos felt as though Jorge dismissed his concerns; Jorge felt frustrated that nothing he said could assuage Carlos’s sense of isolation. But Jorge tried. Six weeks or so after the reunion, Jorge asked Carlos for a photo of himself. That Saturday, Jorge went to a tattoo parlor. He already had a tattoo of his mother over his heart. Now he sat in a chair for four painful hours as his favorite practitioner needled his brother’s image permanently into his flesh, just inches away from the image of his mother. He came home and lifted his shirt to show Carlos the work, his skin still bloody and swollen from the violence of the needle. It was, Carlos would later remark, with tears in his eyes, the best present anyone had ever given him. It brought him some measure of peace.

Photo

At breakfast in La Paz, however, Carlos felt that Jorge was provoking him once again. Moments after Carlos pulled out that photo, Jorge turned to him and brought up a sensitive subject the two had already discussed in many late-night conversations: Who would Carlos have turned out to be had he been raised in Santander?

Come on, Carlos, Jorge said — look around. Do you really think that if you had been raised here you would have ended up an accountant or even a professional?

Carlos refused to concede Jorge’s point. Who was to say he wouldn’t have found a way to go to school, to get his degree, to be working in the very same firm where he had only just recently been promoted?

William said nothing, but his face took on a hard cast. Carlos had no idea, he thought, how far a strong will could or could not get you. William had that strong will, had tried to exert it in every way, desperate to get to that petty-­officer training. First, he had moved to Bogotá to study for his high-school degree. He managed to pass the test, but his score was low — eight months of part-time cramming could not make up for all those years of lost schooling. He made it only onto a waiting list for the petty-­officer training, but that did not deter him. He packed up, left Bogotá and took a long bus ride to the barracks where the leadership course was being offered. When William arrived at the barracks, a commanding officer recognized him. ‘‘Those who persevere succeed,’’ the officer told him. The commanding officer managed to pull some strings on William’s behalf, but as they were going through the paperwork, officials discovered that William had already been discharged and compensated by the military for a disease he contracted while serving. The compensation made him ineligible for re-­enlistment. There were no more strings to be pulled; he could never be a petty officer; it was over. He would have to go home. But hadn’t the commanding officer told him that those who persevere succeed? For five days, William stayed past his welcome, hiding and mingling among the groups of soldiers. He hoped that things would sort themselves out, but more than that, he could not bring himself to leave: Leaving meant he had given up. On the sixth day, a sympathetic but fully armed officer accompanied him to the bus station and personally put him on a bus back to Bogotá.

William knew that Carlos was unfamiliar with that part of his history. Carlos probably did not know that William, as a 6-year-old, used to walk with his mother to this very town, La Paz, for five hours each way, just to buy groceries; they would spend the night at a kind woman’s place in town and then walk home again, groceries on their backs. And Carlos could not know, could never really know, how many hours William had spent hacking sugar cane with a machete as a teenager, his skin crawling from the heat and the itchy scraps of stalk, carrying 50 pounds of cane at a time, mindless, painful, strenuous work. Carlos had spent those same years, William knew, flirting with girls at an excellent public high school, playing basketball with his friends, racking up points on some video game, the name of which William would not even know.

Carlos was wrong, William felt certain. Sometimes, a will was not enough. Had he grown up in Santander, Carlos would not be an accountant on the rise right now. And Carlos’s insistence on that point felt, to William, like an insult to all he had endured — a life he had endured, no less, in Carlos’s place.

When City Meets Country

After breakfast, the cars left La Paz, driving on serpentine, stone-strewn roads with lush palm fronds and ferns closing in overhead. With the heat of the sun now strong, one driver kept mopping his sweating face with a bandanna he borrowed from one of the relatives in the car, as if he was physically exhausted from the stress of maneuvering the vehicle over riverbeds and around ditches. Finally, around 11:30 a.m., the caravan stopped near a large gazebo in a grassy field. Everyone piled out of the vehicles. It was time to walk.

Segal had brought a bright purple rolling suitcase, which held materials she hoped to use that day for interviews and research with William and Wilber’s family; their brother, Ancelmo, now lived in their childhood home, but their parents and other relatives would also be there to celebrate Ancelmo’s birthday and see the twins. It became clear that the grassy path would not be suitable for luggage rolling, so William, who had carried far heavier loads on this journey before, easily slung the purple suitcase onto his shoulders.

The group started making its way along the path, which briefly lurched uphill. William was moving at high speed, despite the suitcase. He called out that as strong as he was, Jorge was every bit as strong, although it seemed unlikely that that could possibly true. ‘‘But not Carlos,’’ William said. ‘‘Carlos is not as strong.’’ William took a few more steps, then turned around as if something had occurred to him. ‘‘Why shouldn’t Carlos carry it?’’ he said. He backtracked until he reached Carlos, pushed the suitcase at him and then quickly headed off.

The path tracked across a grassy meadow and then started a long, steep descent. Within minutes, the path was made of mud — rich, claylike mud that was two feet deep in some patches. Carlos, who was always impeccably dressed, stepped carefully. But his Adidas basketball sneakers were quickly soaked with oozing earth.

Carlos was as uncomfortable emotionally as he was physically. He had visited Santander twice since the reunion — once for a birthday party for all four brothers in La Paz and once to visit his biological parents, José del Carmen Cañas (known as Carmelo) and Ana Delina Velasco, at the home where they now lived. But he felt ill at ease on both visits. He knew William thought he had behaved churlishly, resisting the friendly overtures of his extended family. But there were just too many people around — locals, cousins, every one of them, it had seemed, wanting a photograph or a hug or some other sign of a connection that he himself did not feel. How was he supposed to get to know his biological parents when there was always a crowd around? When he met Carmelo and Ana for the very first time at William and Wilber’s apartment, a camera crew for a Colombian newsmagazine show had been with them in the room. As he embraced his biological parents, they were weeping profusely. He was moved when he felt Carmelo’s arms around him — he had never really known his own father, who died not long after his mother did. But something about Ana’s tears left him feeling detached, calm. He had had a mother, and a very good one at that. ‘‘Don’t cry,’’ he said to Ana, wiping her tears. ‘‘These are God’s ways.’’

It was high noon in Santander. Carlos picked his way through the mud, which splattered and quickly baked hard onto his legs in the sun. Then Carlos — Carlos, who was so vain about his clothing, fussy about fit, who was always brushing at the cuff of his pants to rid it of some imaginary lint — let out a howl. His foot had sunk deep in the mud. Slowly, with the help of someone from the area who was walking alongside him, he began to extricate it. There was a loud suctioning sound: Sludge coated his bare leg well past his knee.

Photo

More than an hour later, sweaty, exhausted, filthy, Carlos arrived with the group at William and Wilber’s childhood home. It had no toilet, no drywall, no paint, just wooden sides and a wood-­burning stove with a pipe jutting out of the roof. Carlos approached Carmelo with a smile: The two hugged warmly. But then there was silence; neither seemed to know what to say. William was standing close by, watching Carlos and his father. William looked pristine, except for a little mud on his boots. He wore a striped purple button-­down shirt for the occasion; Carlos was dressed in a black baseball cap with a Batman symbol on it, a tank top and sunglasses. He had not even had a moment to catch his breath when William quickly batted his cap. ‘‘Take off your hat and sunglasses,’’ William told Carlos. ‘‘Try to really be here.’’

Carlos watched Jorge, who was moving easily through the crowd, ingratiating himself with William and Wilber’s family in a way that Carlos still could not. Carlos was still annoyed about the conversation they had at breakfast. Jorge seemed to want him to make some grand emotional statement about how lucky he had been in the swap, how much tougher his lot would have been had he, in fact, been raised in Santander. It was not as if he hadn’t thought hard, lying awake many nights, about what his fate would have been had he been raised with this biological family. Two of William and Wilber’s brothers had died very young, one in a gun accident and one in an ambush while serving in the military. He might not even be alive if he had grown up here. Maybe it was easy to be a good guy in Bogotá. Maybe if he had grown up in Santander, he would have joined the guerrillas, who were popular a decade earlier but also brutal. Far from believing in the inevitability of his professional success, he worried about whether his character, in that alternate life, would have withstood the forces around him.

But no, he was not going to say all of that at breakfast, in front of a bunch of people. That was not who he was.

PART 3

The Myth of Identical Twins

At the moment that a sperm penetrates an egg, that single-­cell zygote is what is known as totipotent: It is pure potential. It has in it the makings of an eyebrow’s curve, a heart’s thick muscle, a neuron’s electrochemical power; it has in it the finicky instructional manual that will direct the building of the body’s every fiber and the regulation of those fibers. But that one cell splits into two, and instantly, lights begin to go out, potential dims. In order for that one cell to become a tiny bit of flesh in a heart, and not the hair of an eyebrow, one or more of its genetic signaling pathways must shut down. The result is differentiation, a steady process of elimination that allows complex biological universes to be built. Every time a group of cells divides, each one becomes more like one thing, less like another.

By the time that embryo is five or six days old, which is when a majority of fateful twin splits occur, some of those cells, by chance, go to one twin and some to the other. This means that the expression of some genes in one of those future twins is already, in subtle ways, likely to be different from the expression of genes in the other future twin, theorizes Harvey Kliman, the director of the reproductive and placental research unit at the Yale School of Medicine. From the moment that most identical twins separate, they may well have different epigenetics, a term that refers to the way genes are read and expressed, depending on environment. They are already different products of their environment, the environment being whatever uterine conditions rendered them separate beings in the first place.

The casual observer is fascinated by how similar identical twins are, but some geneticists are more interested in identifying all the reasons they might differ, sometimes in significant ways. Why might one identical twin be gay or transgender and not the other? Why do identical twins, born with the same DNA, sometimes die of different diseases at different times in their lives? Their environments must be different, but which aspect of their environment is the one that took their biology in a different direction? Smoking, stress, obesity — those are some of the factors that researchers have been able to link to specific changes in the expression of specific genes. They expect, in time, to find hundreds, possibly thousands, of others.

The meta-­analysis published this spring in Nature Genetics, which examined 50 years of studies of twins, arrived at a conclusion about the impact of heredity and environment on human beings’ lives. On average, the researchers found, any particular trait or disease in an individual is about 50 percent influenced by environment and 50 percent influenced by genes. But that simple ratio does not capture our complicated systems of genetic circuitry, the way our genes steadily interact with the environment, switching on, switching off, depending on the stimulus, sometimes with lasting results that will continue on in our genome, passed to the next generation. How an individual’s genes respond to that environment — how they are expressed — creates what scientists call an epigenetic profile.

Before she left for Bogotá, Segal contacted Jeffrey Craig, who studies epigenetics at Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Australia, to ask if he would analyze the epigenetics of Carlos, Jorge, Wilber and William, using saliva swabs she would obtain while she was there.

Craig has analyzed the epigenetic profiles of 34 identical and fraternal twins at birth, collecting swabs from their inner cheeks. To Craig, it was noteworthy that in some cases — not many, but some — the epigenetic profile of one newborn twin was more similar to an unrelated baby than to the identical twin with whom that baby shared a womb. Structural differences in the womb could possibly account for it, Craig says — a thicker umbilical cord for one than the other (there are, in fact, two cords) or an awkward site of connection for the umbilical cord on the placenta. But he recognizes that there could be additional factors still in the realm of guesswork. Perhaps one twin is farther from the sound of the mother’s heart, its reassuring steady beat, sending that child on a slightly different life course.

Segal and Craig were eager to see the epigenetic results for the Colombian twins. Whose epigenetic profile, they wondered, would look more alike? The biologically unrelated twins who shared an environment — Segal calls them virtual twins — or the ones whose DNA was the same?

A sample of four subjects could only raise questions, not answer them. But epigenetic testing on larger samples of twins reared apart could one day provide a valuable resource for epigenetic science, says Kelly Klump, who is the co-­director of the Michigan State University Twin Registry. ‘‘You can’t look at how the environment will change the function of the genome without holding constant the genome,’’ she says. ‘‘Identical twins allow you to do that.’’ Given how hard it is to find identical twins raised apart, twins researchers working in epigenetics have mostly been focusing on the identical twins who show difference. Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, is generating a huge global registry for identical twins in which only one twin has, for example, diabetes or autism.

Bouchard was influential in convincing his fellow researchers, as well as the public, that some significant part of who we are is influenced by DNA, which was hardly a given when he started his work. Spector and Craig, by contrast, are trying to identify how, exactly, we change in response to the environment. Their essential question is different: How can science identify genes that have been flicked on or off, with potentially harmful results, so they can be switched back the other way? Traditional twin studies were perceived to be seeking the immutable; epigenetic twin studies try to clarify what, in us, is subject to change — and more specifically, what mechanisms make that change happen.

Falling Into a Hole

A local politician had accompanied the group on the hike to Santander. Along the way, he tried to persuade the group to visit a nearby attraction: the second-­biggest hole in Colombia, a cavernous pit 500 feet wide and 600 feet deep. Locals like to get on their bellies, inch their way up to its rim and peer down into the abyss.

The second-­biggest hole became a recurring joke among the brothers, but for Yesika Montoya, the Colombian psychologist, it also became something of a metaphor for the young men’s experience. She was trying to get them to identify their feelings about all they had gone through, partly by recalling the physical sensations that they felt at various stages. ‘‘It was vertigo,’’ Jorge told her, as he described waiting for William the first time they met. ‘‘I felt a pressure. Like when you go on the roller coaster and you’re falling.’’

Montoya imagined that feeling to be like ‘‘going down a hole and not being able to feel the bottom.’’ She added: ‘‘It never stops. And just when you have put a foot here or there, you keep going down.’’

The process of spending time with Segal and Montoya and sharing their life histories necessarily changed the young men’s experience of their reunion. Carlos seemed surprised at one point when Segal asked him to describe the ways in which he and Wilber differed. ‘‘Well, the thing is, we’ve always focused on what our similarities are,’’ Carlos said. ‘‘We haven’t actually talked about our differences.’’ He seemed pleased, at last, to be given the opportunity.

At the time, Carlos pointed out that he liked older women, while Wilber liked younger ones. But the answer was, of course, far more complicated. Carlos was like Wilber in large, sweeping ways, and unlike him in infinite small ways: the expressions that darted across his and his face alone, the thoughts and worries that filled his mind. Carlos was, for better or for worse, more cynical than Wilber, more suave; Wilber was more joyful around small children, quicker to laugh out loud.

Jorge and William, too, have obvious differences. Jorge is a dreamer, a restless traveler, an optimist who believes that ‘‘if you give your best to the world, it will give its best back.’’ William’s face, more narrow, more gaunt, reflects a far warier outlook. ‘‘Nothing in life is easy,’’ he remarked once, a sentiment that you could hardly imagine Jorge expressing.

Was every one of these differences learned? Did some reflect different epigenetics? Perhaps there might be some extra biological protection built in for Wilber and Jorge, who, unlike Carlos and William, had been raised in their biological mothers’ arms. The mother who raised Carlos loved him, he knew. But he was also aware that a cousin had moved in with them when they were babies, expressly so that each child could be the beneficiary of the form of attachment parenting the hospital was encouraging at the time. Their mother wore Jorge in a sling; it was the cousin who wore Carlos.

In May, Carlos told Wilber that he wanted to visit his biological family, but without crowds of relatives or psychologists or camera crews. And Wilber passed that on to William. It was becoming easier for William to accept that Carlos’s reserve on those excursions to Santander was not so much in reaction to his new family as it was in response to the public nature of the outings. On a weekend in June when Wilber unfortunately had to work, William, Jorge and Carlos took a bus to see Carmelo and Ana for a relaxed, private visit.

Carlos sat next to William on the bus on their way up and listened as William, who had become something of a local celebrity in Santander, talked about his plans to run for City Council in La Paz. Carlos did not think much of Colombian politicians, but he was impressed by William’s ambition; he liked that William was taking a class to learn Microsoft Word. He had discovered, from the questions Segal and Montoya asked, that Wilber had no intention of returning to school. That disappointed him; he wanted to talk to Wilber about more than women. He wanted more for Wilber — wanted more from Wilber, but he was starting to think he might not get it.

Carlos knew Wilber wanted the two of them to spend more time together. But he also knew that Wilber, at some level, understood that Carlos was a solitary soul. Wilber, at any rate, had a life of his own and a new girlfriend, who had two young children whose photos he showed off, with admiration, to anyone who would look. The whole experience was less complicated for Wilber than for the other three brothers — simply because, as Wilber himself put it, he was not a very complicated person.

For Carlos, this fourth visit to Santander felt like a fresh start. The brothers arrived at Ana and Carmelo’s home early in the morning, after traveling through the night, but Carlos was enjoying the beauty of the countryside too much to go straight to sleep. Instead, he bathed in a water tank. He listened to the birds; he was a willing audience to the family parrot, Roberto, who had a talent for singing ranchera songs. Then, while his brothers dozed, he wandered into the kitchen, where Ana, a tiny woman — he had her giggle, he was told, although he never heard it that way himself — was cleaning a sheep’s head she would cook for dinner that night. He stood by the kitchen counter, keeping her company as she worked. He realized it was their first time alone.

They talked about her health, her aching joints, her back pain. ‘‘You know, you’ve worked so much your whole life,’’ Carlos told her. ‘‘It’s time for you to rest. Your children are so big already. Why do you work so hard for them?’’ The relationship with Ana felt more relaxed, but not necessarily closer. He told himself it would come in time. Jorge was always implying that there was something wrong with him for not feeling, instantly, that powerful, primal connection, that emotional force of biology and destiny, that William seemed to feel for the mother he never got to know. Carlos wondered whether he might have drawn closer to Ana had his own mother been alive to grant some kind of permission. But maybe it was simpler than that. Maybe he and William were just different that way.

Moving Forward

Before starting her research, Segal would not have been surprised if each young man tested similarly to his identical twin, despite their different environments. But her preliminary results, she said, show that on a number of traits, the identical twins were less alike than she initially anticipated. ‘‘I came away with a real respect for the effect of an extremely different environment,’’ Segal said.

Perhaps the results merely indicate that people raised in deeply rural environments, with little education, take tests in a wholly different manner from those who attended a university. William, who managed a small business with competence, at times seemed overwhelmed by the test. But Segal considered the young men’s story a case history that might provoke further research, inspiring others to seek out more examples of twins reared apart with significantly different upbringings, whatever they were.

Over the course of the week that the young men spent on Segal’s questionnaires, they looked back at the past that helped make them who they were. How many books did they have in their childhood homes? Did they ever smoke? Did they grow up in families in which people kept their feelings to themselves? For one week, they stepped out of time to look backward. But the moment Segal would leave, they would continue on their usual paths, speeding forward toward some unknown future, colliding with chance. They sometimes talked about all living together; as four, William liked to think, they were at their strongest. Like members of any family, they might drift and then regroup, or find themselves falling back on the deep comfort of their particular bonds. It is rare to grow up as a twin at all, part of a primal pair; now each young man had a second, rare pairing, a second chance at an unusual kind of closeness. What did that kind of entanglement — a double-­doubling — mean for whom they would each become or what they might achieve?

To celebrate the end of a week’s worth of research, Segal and Montoya decided to take the young men dancing one night at a popular Bogotá steak house with a big dance floor. Jorge and William took turns dancing with Segal; they smiled gamely and turned and twirled with only glancing attention to the rhythm. Carlos, in his element, showed Wilber a few steps; they danced in not-­quite-­synchrony, side by side, Carlos with sureness, Wilber staring down at his feet and concentrating. Occasionally he looked up, as if he was feeling it: He would get the hang of it soon enough, he knew. ‘‘Wilber has the goods,’’ Montoya said, watching from the table. ‘‘He just needs the experience.’’ When all the brothers stopped for more aguardiente, a sugar-­cane based liqueur, and sat at the table, they took turns flirting with a young woman who had joined the party.

Here at the club, Carlos was assured, poised, smooth. As the evening wore on and he drank more aguardiente, his moves got bigger, more daring, until he was showing off a maneuver that he and a friend had made up one night, a pivot from the waist that had him leaning so far back that his spine was practically parallel with the floor, his knees bent and nearly buckling. Carlos called that move ‘‘the Matrix,’’ after a similar backward dodge that the movie’s star, Keanu Reeves, executes while evading bullets in a parallel universe. As he leaned all the way back, Carlos looked as if he might lose his balance altogether. Wilber, William and Jorge quickly surrounded him, still dancing, a mixture of emotions on their faces: amusement, irritation, concern. But Carlos was not falling. It only looked that way, and he managed to right himself.

The dancing went on as before. The four men seemed to bounce off one another in different pairs and groupings, splitting off in search of young women, returning to compare notes before heading out onto the floor again. They were one, they were two, they were four, merging, dividing and merging again as the music played, long into the evening.",REAL
How Does Paul Rudd Work?,"Seemingly every American moviegoer has at least one touchstone Paul Rudd performance lodged in his or her heart. For goofballs, it’s his character in ‘‘Wet Hot American Summer’’: a belligerent waffle-eating Romeo with dumb eyes. For maladjusts, it’s his underdog in ‘‘Prince Avalanche.’’ For the Dionysian bro, it’s the desk-slapping newsman of ‘‘Anchorman’’ (and ‘‘Anchorman 2’’); for the Apollonian bro, it’s his squirrelly mensch in ‘‘I Love You, Man.’’ For cynics, it’s Pete in ‘‘Knocked Up’’ and ‘‘This Is 40.’’ For monogamists, it’s his horny journeyman in ‘‘Wanderlust.’’ For Reddit users, it’s the Tim & Eric sketch ‘‘Paul Rudd’s Computer.’’ For people with the treasure-hunting prowess of a truffle pig, it’s his heir in ‘‘The Chateau.’’ For people with New Yorker cartoons taped to their fridge, it’s his earnest postulant in the play ‘‘Grace.’’ For most women, it is Josh from ‘‘Clueless.’’

Naturally, Marvel is not interested in any of the small-fry demographic slices captured by Rudd’s other movies, women included. The Marvel bet is that the actor’s magic can be combined with the studio’s batting average to turn ‘‘Ant-Man’’ into the equivalent of Josh from ‘‘Clueless’’ in the hearts of movie-watching males. As evidence of this wager, note that a seven-inch Rudd-as-Ant-Man action figure is already available for $24.95 at the studio’s web store, limit two per customer.

Later, as Rudd maneuvered up the theater stairs and through the front door, a wordless ripple of lit-up eyes followed him, culminating in some fans’ stopping him to take selfies outside. His effect on reality was distortive, but in a pleasant way. A sprinkle of MSG.

Pinewood Atlanta Studios is a gated complex in Fayetteville, Ga., containing what looks like a couple of Walmarts: big Duplo-block structures built on a scale that feels vaguely hostile to humanity. Among the buildings is an on-site Home Depot exclusively for the use of crew members. It is rumored that a stand-alone Chick-fil-A will soon join the Home Depot and that this outpost of Pinewood Studios, which is an international conglomerate of film-and-television production services, will eventually form its own microcity, complete with housing and light retail. Everything in sight is a sandy peach color, except the sky, which is silver. The studio stands next to a suggestion of an actual pine wood, which is a coincidence. This is where your superhero movies are made.

It was a week after the play, and Rudd sat in his trailer at Pinewood waiting to be summoned to the ‘‘Captain America: Civil War’’ set, a two-minute S.U.V. ride away. Last year he filmed ‘‘Ant-Man’’ at this same complex, and now that the character has been introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you can expect to see him popping up in future big-budget properties. For an actor like Rudd, Ant-Man is an appealing character. He is not a hit single, like Spider-Man, but a deep cut in the Marvel catalog: Track 4 on Side D of the U.K. pressing of a double album. When he appeared on ‘‘Late Show With David Letterman’’ in April, Rudd described his superhero’s powers in these words: ‘‘He wears a suit, and he shrinks down to the size of an ant. And he can also, um, control the ants. Communicate with the ants.’’ Cue audience tittering.

Rudd’s path to leading-man status has been less a rocket ascent than a pinball trajectory. He grew up in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., to British-­born parents. ‘‘I wasn’t one of those kids who was like, ‘I want to be an actor,’ ’’ he said. ‘‘It wasn’t in my wheelhouse at all. I wasn’t from a family that did this or in a place where people did this.’’ He acted in college, moved to Los Angeles, was cast as the Mr. Knightley analogue in ‘‘Clueless,’’ then went to study Jacobean drama at the British American Drama Academy in Oxford, England. (This, combined with the imported parents, might have left a mark on his speaking manner, which is an underrated Rudd asset. He doesn’t so much pronounce his T’s as circumnavigate them.) After Oxford, Rudd moved to New York and alternated theater work with movie work. He has lived there ever since.

Rudd co-wrote the ‘‘Ant-Man’’ screenplay, which may be a reason the movie has a light subtext of self-aware why-is-this-movie-getting-made-ness that will either charm you into submission or make you squirm, depending on your level of cynicism about Hollywood. It’s the same gloss of irony that shimmered across the surface of ‘‘Guardians of the Galaxy,’’ and the world was fine letting that movie have its cake and eat it too, for the simple (but sort of profound) reason that Chris Pratt seemed like a guy who deserved cake. Surely the same is true of Rudd. He is the kind of optimized everyman that normal everymen might elect into the office of representing them on-screen, if such men were given a ballot.

To prepare for the day’s scenes, Rudd drank black coffee and watched an infomercial about an eight-in-one all-purpose wheelbarrow available for four easy payments of $39.95. One of the wheelbarrow’s advertised functions was as a ‘‘rock mover,’’ which made him laugh. It also converted to a snowplow, which aroused Rudd’s skepticism: ‘‘I’ve seen a lot of wheelbarrows in my time, and none of them can do that,’’ he said, changing the channel.

The trailer’s interior was clean and entirely brownish. Everything had a dimmer switch or was in some other way adjustable. In the dressing-room area, Rudd’s Ant-Man costume constituents were tidily arranged. A variety of exoskeleton pieces, which I’m not allowed to describe, were laid alongside a smattering of accessories and an array of foundation garments, right down to a silky square of underpants. It was a new version of the suit, made for ‘‘Civil War,’’ and Rudd had not yet tried it on. There was a knock on the door: A woman had arrived to help him into his outfit. ‘‘It’s like a pit crew,’’ he said. ‘‘I can’t get into the suit myself.’’

When Rudd emerged from the dressing room a few minutes later, he was standing very erectly and looking like a man-size version of his own toy. ‘‘I can’t bend my knees,’’ he said. ‘‘And I can’t really sit down. But I can dance!’’ (He danced.) Then he angled his way into an S.U.V. and was driven around the corner to the set, which looked like a disembodied quarter of a sports arena made entirely of green-screen material, populated by a fleet of heavy machinery and a couple hundred people engaged in detailed tasks. Many of the crew on the set worked on ‘‘Ant-Man’’ too, and they wore frayed ‘‘Ant-Man’’ baseball caps and goofed around with Rudd as he plodded around in his heavy suit. They did not instinctively stay out of his way, as they did around some of the other actors.

‘‘It’s gonna be a scorcher,’’ someone said. ‘‘Can I get you a hot coffee?’’

‘‘Yes,’’ Rudd said. ‘‘Also do you have any chili?’’

Next, he stepped into a tent among a row of tents, where the Ant-Man costume was further rigged by six more people. The choreography of this rigging must also remain secret. Whenever Rudd roamed the studio grounds in uniform, he wore a cloak covering himself from head to toe, to thwart stealth photographers determined to leak pictures of the costume online. Even the uncloaked eight-pace journey from his trailer to the S.U.V. presented a slight risk. People care deeply about revealing these things to the world — the size of a thigh holster or the cut of a reinforced combat trouser — and Marvel cares deeply in turn. Members of the Marvel security team on the set spoke of ‘‘bloggers’’ the way Dick Cheney once invoked a ‘‘global terror network’’ — in order to suggest a cabalistic threat, to make a rhetorical point about risk, to justify seemingly irrational behavior, or all three. There was a reminder next to the women’s bathroom, among other places, not to snap photos on set. There were designated garbage bins for sensitive documents. When a distracted crew member dropped a call sheet, it took one second for three other crew members to dive for that sheet and press it back upon its owner. Because who knows what could happen? A barn owl could swoop down, snatch the paper, eat it, fly directly over a Marvel superfan’s house and regurgitate the call sheet in a scrutable format onto that fan’s flagstone patio. Stuff could go viral.

Rudd emerged from his black-ops costume tent and headed over to chat with his stunt double. An undisclosable number of other Avengers were also on set with their stunt doubles, and it was fun, in a primitive way, to see the pairs standing next to each other: the actor, on one side, looking like a photograph of himself; and the stunt double, on the other side, emitting the distinct aura of a knockoff.

Around 9:15, it was time to shoot. There were shouts of ‘‘Here we go’’ and ‘‘Rolling.’’ Rudd put his Ant-Man helmet on. They filmed a scene. It took four seconds. Everyone went back, reset and filmed the scene again. Another four seconds.

Then a pause. Rudd removed the helmet and drank some water. He vanished for a moment and then reappeared carrying a padded briefcase with tubes streaming out of it that plugged into the lower back of his suit to circulate chilled water throughout the armored costume. The briefcase was not so much a frivolity as a form of insurance against passing out. The Georgia weather is so crazy — so hot, so sticky, so much like being baked inside a fruit pie — that it consumed all small talk and evaporated all vanities.

Between shots, Rudd exercised a knack for inclusive tomfoolery. At one point, his assistant of two years, a human-shaped sunbeam named Thomas Deming-Henes, wheeled over a swivel chair in case his boss wanted to sit down. Before sitting, Rudd exaggeratedly paused and wiped a mote of dust off the seat. ‘‘Oh, here, let me get that,’’ said Deming-Henes, pretending to clean the dust with a corner of his shirt. ‘‘Oh, here, let me get that,’’ said another crew member in turn, wiping Deming-Henes’s shirt corner with his own shirt corner. Rudd: ‘‘Can this be reupholstered?’’ Then, affecting to sit down: ‘‘Why aren’t you guys lowering me?’’ Giggles all around. Twenty feet away, a different Avenger hammily belted show tunes into a personal fan while some crew members pretended to laugh. Noninclusive.

Even if he’s angelic about it, Rudd is still a grown man being paid tons of money to depict a bug. And that does take a village. When he sat in the chair, a kink formed in his cooling tube and blocked the flow of air. An assistant noticed and darted over to fix it. Someone else paper-­toweled the actor’s forehead. A third person buffed a buffable portion of his costume. He was offered water, almonds and gum in Bubble Breeze and Arctic Grape flavors. I was eating an apple from craft services and joined the chorus to offer Rudd a bite, which he accepted like a suckling pig — his hands were gauntleted and immobile — and then had an allergic reaction to.

If he knew he had an apple allergy, why did he take a bite? ‘‘It seemed like the right thing to do,’’ Rudd replied, his tongue fuzzy. It was a mild allergy.

‘‘I’m not good at small talk, I’m really not,’’ Rudd told me after the play in New York, inching his way through a glass of Scotch. ‘‘I’m not that great at any talk.’’

This wasn’t entirely true, but his fluency seesaws, depending on the topic of conversation. Talking about himself: not very fluent. Talking about bagpipes, moving sidewalks, music with synthesizers, the sinking of the Lusitania, Ireland, baseball, aquariums or Paul Newman: very fluent.

He is especially fluent on Newman, who is the person Rudd’s mind goes to when he thinks of lodestar actors and lodestar men in general: ‘‘He was a guy who never took it too seriously, and he gave more than he received, and he understood the importance of that, and I think he’s the kind of guy who everyone should try and emulate.’’ Rudd did a play with Newman, in Westport, Conn. Newman once asked him over for lunch and showed him his barn full of movie memorabilia, and they talked about life. Newman made salad dressing.

Rudd was more reflective in Atlanta, where he was staying in a high-rise hotel suite with a view of downtown: two pools, two cranes, a residential hotel, a construction site and a billboard for Jimmy John’s restaurant. The room had a microwave and a leather ottoman topped with a fan of regional magazines. (Rudd: ‘‘I brought those with me.’’) That morning, he had a fitting and then an interview and then a nap, during which he had a dream that he could no longer remember. Tonight, he handed over the slab of a room-service menu and said: ‘‘What looks good? Probably nothing,’’ which was correct.

Lately, he had been eating a lot of plain almonds and oatmeal in order to snap nimbly into the Ant-Man costume. In New York, I had asked a lot of questions about this particular aspect of the Marvel machinery: When Rudd was hired, did someone at the studio tell him precisely how much he needed to weigh and which of his muscles to magnify? Are actors fully customizable, like luxury sedans?

The answer is yes, but tacitly. ‘‘No one said anything to me,’’ he said. ‘‘I just kinda took it upon myself.’’ He added: ‘‘I had a great trainer, but Marvel didn’t find him for me. I found him myself. I was like, ‘Make me an ant.’ ’’

The same applied to research, which Rudd undertook on his own. For example: ‘‘The fascinating thing I discovered about ants is, if some water comes along and they need to avoid drowning, they innately know to cross their legs with each other and connect to create a raft. The youngest ants, the baby ants, are the most buoyant, and they put them in the middle.’’

I asked him how he incorporated this into his performance.

‘‘It’s in there,’’ he said.

After dinner, he mentioned that a friend might be going onstage to do comedy and maybe we could go. This didn’t end up happening, but it reminded Rudd of a split-second period as a teenager when he became interested in doing stand-up and worked up five minutes of material, including a joke about 2 percent milk, which he refused to repeat and then, when the tape recorder was turned off, pretended not to remember.

‘‘It wasn’t really a joke, more like an idea of a joke,’’ he hedged.

When prodded to tell the joke, he flopped sideways and jammed his head against a hotel sofa cushion like a fifth grader being threatened by a seventh grader. As counterinterrogation tactics go, it was unconventional but effective. The conversation moved on. (He eventually revealed the joke to a fact-checker: He’s at a grocery store, sees a carton of 2 percent milk and wonders to himself what the other 98 percent is. Punch line: ‘‘One thing’s for sure, I didn’t want to drink it!’’)

This evasion was something I thought about later, too, on the way back to my hotel, when trying to organize the coordinates of Rudd’s personality into a map of his career. Along with the charisma and the extreme winsomeness, Rudd is uncommonly good at embodying what nonactors spend all their energy trying to conceal: every category of pain, from the glancing to the trenchant. This is a talent with sweeping applications. It is funny in broad comedies, biting in prickly indies, germane in anything romantic. It is charming in real life. You could argue that a 46-year-old actor choosing to play an antlike creature is a study in the entertainment possibilities of pain. What’s more emasculating, as a class of metamorphosis, than miniaturization?

‘‘Pain’’ is obviously too dire a word to describe Rudd’s 2 percent milk face-plant. But it was still a useful demonstration, especially when you think about how invisibly most people respond when they’re uncomfortable (by freezing up, gritting their teeth). Inventive expressiveness (of vulnerability, of suffering) is so rare. It’s what makes certain people enchantingly sympathetic and certain characters relatable. Maybe even an ant.",REAL
Spike Nation,"Tyson also explained how easy spike is to get in Syracuse. He ticked off the names of corner stores that sold it from behind the counter. Some required users to know code words — ‘‘Skittles,’’ for example — while others sold spike to anybody who asked for it, including children. Along with the stores, and the entrepreneurs peddling sticks to subsidize their own habits, street dealers offered bags of spike purchased in bulk from distributors in New York City.

‘‘That dude over there, with the headphones on?’’ Tyson said. ‘‘He does it.’’ He pointed his chin toward a young man in a leather coat crossing the street. ‘‘He’s got bags on him right now, but he does that pop-top.’’

‘‘Pop-top’’ is slang for the local spike sold in resealable pouches, the cheapest of the cheap. ‘‘You don’t know where it’s been, who did what with it,’’ Tyson said. No brand of spike is tested for its pharmacological effects, but pop-top spike doesn’t even have the benefit of a street rep. It’s the ditch weed of Spike Nation: rank, wet and worst of all, weak — unless you get a ‘‘hotspot,’’ an unpredictably powerful batch. ‘‘Seventeen joints, you might be fine. Eighteenth joint might put you down for six hours,’’ Tyson said. ‘‘That’s probably going to be what’s going to give somebody a heart attack.’’

Tyson said he’d seen a pop-top operation once, in a dingy basement on Syracuse’s north side. Potpourri was spread atop silk screens on Ping-Pong tables, then doused with unknown chemicals from a spray bottle. What pop-top manufacturers lacked in quality control, they made up for in marketing talent. Their spike was even cheaper than the store-bought variety, and new brands hit the street every month. They also produced clever knockoffs, stuffing their inferior spike into pouches identical to popular store brands. ‘‘That’s the name of the game right now, dude,’’ Tyson said. ‘‘Who can have the best-looking bag.’’

Since the attack on Ethan Darbee, the number of spike overdoses in Syracuse has fallen by half, just as mysteriously as it rose. Maybe spike smokers are being more careful, or doctors are reporting overdoses less frequently. Maybe a bad batch of spike finally ran its course. The answer doesn’t really matter. In a year, or a month, or perhaps tomorrow, the chemicals will be completely different, and we’ll be talking about another surge in emergencies.

The problem is resistant to criminal prosecution, or even basic police work. The Syracuse Police Department has a cellphone video of a spike overdose that they use for training purposes. It was taken in the first week of the outbreak, when the police were responding to as many as 20 overdoses a day. A lieutenant played the video for me one afternoon on a computer at the police station. It starts with a man writhing on the floor in a corridor of an apartment building. The man isn’t under arrest, but his hands are cuffed behind his back, for his own safety, until an ambulance can get there. The man screams the same unintelligible words over and over in a hysterical falsetto. He bangs the back of his head against the wall and hammers his bare heels against the floor. Ragged flaps of pink skin hang off his kneecaps. His bottom lip is literally chewed away. The video ends abruptly with the man in midscream. The lieutenant jerked his thumb toward the computer screen. ‘‘Now,’’ he said to me, ‘‘try to get his name and phone number.’’

When the bath-salts outbreak peaked in 2012, the city passed an ordinance equating possession of synthetic drugs with minor infractions like loitering. It also gives the police the authority to confiscate spike from users and, with probable cause, from stores as well. But the ordinance, which pushed spike sales onto the street, did little to prevent the surge of overdoses that hit the city in April. Bill Fitzpatrick, the Onondaga County district attorney, responded to the recent ‘‘crisis,’’ as he put it, by notifying store owners in May that he would charge them with reckless endangerment if they were caught selling spike, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison. That was the extent of his authority. ‘‘What I would ask from the federal government is some sort of sanction against China,’’ a frustrated Fitzpatrick told me. ‘‘Forget about the doctrines of Mao Zedong or Karl Marx — what better way to subvert American society than by shipping this garbage over here and making it attractive to our future generations?’’

In March, the D.E.A. did arrest one Chinese national, a suspected manufacturer who made the mistake of traveling to the United States on business. For the most part, though, federal prosecutors have focused on arresting United States distributors under the controlled-substance-analogue statute, which was designed specifically to target synthetics. According to the statute, prosecutors must prove that the cannabinoids are ‘‘substantially similar’’ to previously banned cannabinoids both chemically and pharmacologically, and that they’re meant for human consumption. That’s why every bag of spike carries the disclaimer ‘‘Not for Human Consumption’’ as a legal fig leaf.

Carla Freedman, assistant United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, has successfully prosecuted many synthetic-drug cases under the statute. She won convictions against not just Syracuse’s bath-salts kingpin but also the owner of a chain of upstate head shops and the members of a Syracuse family who cranked out 200 pounds of spike a month in a rented house with the aid of a cement mixer. ‘‘If you keep taking out smoke shop after smoke shop, you’re putting your finger in the dike,’’ Freedman said. ‘‘If you take out the manufacturer and shut his business down, you stop production for a while.’’

Photo

Her current case concerns three associates of a Los Angeles-based organization called Real Feel Products Inc., who are charged with conspiring ‘‘to distribute one or more controlled-substance analogues.’’ Real Feel has done its business in the open, and indeed claims on its website to rank as ‘‘the Top 5 counter culture distribution company in North America.’’ Since Freedman charged the defendants under the analogue statute, their most likely defense will be to argue that they have changed their products frequently enough to keep them within the realm of legality. It’s Freedman’s job to prove that they didn’t. If they had sold heroin instead of spike, they’d already be in jail, and none of this would be an issue. As if more evidence were necessary to prove that synthetic drugs are the new frontier, Real Feel was also at one point developing a reality television show about growing its business.

Neither Fitzpatrick nor Freedman nor Syracuse’s mayor, Stephanie Miner, had any idea who, or what, was causing the overdoses. In Miner’s view, spike was just the drug of the moment, as heroin was last year and bath salts the year before that. She said she believes the real problem is centered on ‘‘undiagnosed trauma’’ that drives people to use drugs — any drugs — in the first place.

‘‘You can’t arrest your way out of these problems,’’ Miner said. ‘‘If somebody thinks that you can use the law to correct behavior that results from mental health issues? Not gonna happen.’’

The next day I went for a ride along with Police Officer Jacob Breen. Just four years out of the academy, Breen still enjoyed patrolling a beat and showed a keen interest in the social fabric of the city’s tough south- and west-side neighborhoods. After decades of economic decline, Syracuse has become one of the most segregated cities in the country, with a predominantly black underclass trapped in the urban core and middle-class whites living in the suburbs. Onondaga County, where Syracuse is the largest city, also has the third-highest rate of ‘‘zombie homes’’ — abandoned by their owners but not yet reclaimed by the banks — in the state. Cruising from block to block, Breen glanced back and forth between the road and a laptop wedged between our seats that displayed mug shots of felons on open warrants, the majority of them young black men. We passed a dilapidated two-story house, its boarded-up windows tagged with graffiti. The front door was ajar. ‘‘Open for business,’’ Breen said, craning his head around to get a glimpse through the door.

What bothered Breen most about the spike problem was how little he could do about it. Dealers, he knew, didn’t care about being hit with an appearance ticket for violating the city ordinance. He had to spend much of his time running around the city to protect ambulance crews from being attacked by freaked-out spike heads — ‘‘a waste of police resources,’’ he said. Sure enough, around 5 p.m., dispatch put out a call regarding a spike overdose. Four officers were already on the scene when we arrived. They stood in the yard of a tidy white house, trying to coax a man down from a set of stairs. The man was in his 40s, with a shaved head and a scraggly beard. Oblivious to the officers, who seemed to know him, he stared at the sky, rolling his eyes.

‘‘Hey, Will, c’mon,’’ one officer said. ‘‘You want to crawl down?’’ Paramedics wheeled a gurney to the stairs, and the situation escalated quickly. When the police laid hands on him, Will began jerking spastically and didn’t stop, even after he was strapped to the gurney and loaded into the ambulance.

Nurses at the hospital discovered three bags of spike on Will. But there was also a sandwich bag filled with what appeared to be small stones. Breen took the spike and the ‘‘moon rocks,’’ as he called them, to the Public Safety Building downtown. While he went to fetch a drug-test field kit, the supervising officer, Sergeant Novitsky, examined the haul. The moon rocks baffled him. ‘‘I just don’t want to touch it,’’ he said.

Whatever it was, it certainly wasn’t spike. The kit returned negative results for amphetamines, cocaine, LSD, marijuana, MDMA, methadone, methamphetamine and PCP as well. Breen and Novitsky weren’t sure what to do next. Toss the rocks into an evidence locker? Send them to the crime lab? Neither possibility appealed to Breen. ‘‘The lab’s not testing anything we’re sending,’’ he complained. ‘‘They won’t unless it’s a criminal case.’’ Novitsky shrugged. Overdoses weren’t criminal cases. At my suggestion, Breen decided to take it to Ross Sullivan, an emergency-room doctor at Upstate who has been investigating the toxicology of synthetic drugs.

We parked outside the entrance of Upstate’s emergency department and waited in the dark for the handoff. This was how knowledge of synthetic drugs was being advanced — an ersatz drug deal between a rookie cop and a toxicologist, with a reporter acting as middleman. It was absurd, but it was also somehow fitting. The synthetic-drug industry, and the response to it, are based on improvisation. A molecule is tweaked in a Chinese lab, triggering a chain reaction that goes all the way down the line from dealers to users to paramedics and the police to doctors and lawyers. Just when everybody seems to have a handle on it, the molecule gets tweaked again, and the cycle begins anew. Whatever these rocks were, Upstate’s doctors might very well see a flood of overdoses on it next year.",REAL
What Are the Limits of ‘Religious Liberty’?,"Photo

‘‘I can’t. It’s against my religion.’’ Americans tend to handle religious objections with care, personally and politically. When a guest says, for example, that he can’t eat the food being served because it’s not kosher or halal, the host usually hastens to find an alternative. And when people resist following a law on the basis of faith, the government and the courts may try to accommodate them. It’s an American legacy that dates back to before the founding, when some of the original colonies were set up as havens for religious dissenters. Under the banner of belief, Quakers and Mennonites in the 18th century won the right not to join state militias. The first conscientious objectors were religious objectors, and from there, the category expanded to include moral opponents of war. The same pattern holds for home-schoolers. It was an Amish father, not a hippie mother, who first got the Supreme Court’s permission to take his children out of school in 1972, based on his religious commitment to ‘‘life aloof from the world,’’ as the justices respectfully put it.

Making exceptions to the law for people of faith has become part of the American definition of religious tolerance, part of our ethos of live and let live. It has also helped keep the peace in a polyglot nation. In France, it’s illegal for a Muslim woman to wear a head scarf at a public school. In the United States, it’s illegal for a clothing store to refuse to hire a Muslim woman because she wore a head scarf to her job interview. When the Supreme Court issued that ruling last month, eight of nine justices agreed that Samantha Elauf, who lost out on a job at Abercrombie Kids because of a companywide policy banning head coverings, was asking for ‘‘favored treatment’’ — to which she was entitled by federal employment law. ‘‘This is really easy,’’ Justice Antonin Scalia said, announcing the decision from the bench.

And yet we’ve arrived at an unfortunate impasse over the meaning of religious liberty. Unlike in earlier eras, when religious objections let the faithful separate themselves from institutions they felt they could not support, many conservatives now deploy the phrase as a way of excluding other people. Take the furious outcry that erupted in response to the Supreme Court’s 5-to-4 decision to make same-sex marriage legal in every state. Conservative pushback began with the dissenting justices: Clarence Thomas warned of ‘‘potentially ruinous consequences for religious liberty.’’ Some Republican officeholders rushed to throw up whatever shield they could for people of faith. Two states have declared that county clerks may refrain from issuing marriage licenses if they don’t want to give them to gay couples as a matter of conscience. Bakers, photographers and florists — and adoption agencies and landlords — who cite their religion when refusing to serve gay couples won assurances like this one from Greg Abbott, governor of Texas: ‘‘No Texan is required by the Supreme Court’s decision to act contrary to his or her religious beliefs regarding marriage.’’

The same-sex-marriage resisters hope to capitalize on a recent expansion of religious liberties, in another big case about modern-day sexual norms. In a divisive 5-to-4 ruling last year, the Supreme Court extended to a company, and not just to individuals, the right to mount a religious objection to a law. The craft-store chain Hobby Lobby, which is owned by evangelicals, refused to pay for certain forms of birth control for its female employees, as the Affordable Care Act requires. The owners argued that providing health insurance that covered emergency contraception and IUDs offended their evangelical beliefs, saying these methods induce abortions (by taking effect after fertilization). Hobby Lobby had little scientific support for that assertion. By contrast, in defending the contraception mandate, the Obama administration could cite the consensus medical view that providing a variety of birth-control methods benefits women’s health. Nonetheless, the court sided with Hobby Lobby and its sense of conscience.

The court’s decision led to a burst of feminist outrage, but Hobby Lobby didn’t face a sustained boycott. And so it was surprising when another push for religious objection crashed into a wall of public condemnation earlier this year. Legislators in Indiana and Arkansas expected a smooth ride for their versions of a bill called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The first law by that name was passed by Congress in 1993 by huge, bipartisan margins. R.F.R.A. established a balancing test that remains in effect: When someone complains that a federal law substantially burdens his or her free exercise of religion, the government must show that it has a compelling interest in applying that law.",REAL
The Bicycle Thief,"Exploring the usual mountain of bikes near my subway station, I saw that some were little more than rotting metal skeletons; others were bent or missing saddles. But then I found a nice shiny red one with beige handlebars and a basket. It looked brand-new. Even the key was there in the open lock. I could hardly believe that someone didn’t want it. I took the bike and rode away.

I cycled around on it for a couple of weeks. One afternoon when I came out of the subway, a Japanese man was standing near the bike. Thinking nothing of it, I bent to unlock it and the man started shouting and taking photos of me with his cellphone. He was talking so fast that I couldn’t understand what he was saying. Finally he began shouting an English word that I understood well enough: ‘‘Thief!’’

Suddenly, the police were there. The man spoke to them and gestured toward the bike. I was ushered into a police car and taken to the station.

I found myself in a very small Japanese-style room with tatami mats on the floor. Four police officers surrounded me. An older, overweight one with a mean face barked at me. Flustered and a little scared, I couldn’t remember a word of the language, not that I speak much. Somehow, after a little more barking, I managed to let them know I couldn’t comprehend what they were saying. They exited, and I was left in the cramped room with a very low wooden table, my shoes outside the door. I felt very vulnerable, but I think now that this was the point.

Eventually, another officer entered. He spoke some English and took my details, asking where I got the bicycle. I explained I had found it outside a subway station.

‘‘You stole it?’’ he asked.

‘‘No,’’ I said. ‘‘I found it. I didn’t know it belonged to someone else. I thought it had been left there on purpose.’’

‘‘Isn’t that theft?’’

‘‘No, I didn’t steal it. It was a mistake.’’

He asked the same questions — Did you steal it? Did you take it? — over and over, until finally he said: ‘‘Let me explain, we cannot let you go until you admit the theft. It would be better to say quickly that you did it.’’

‘‘I didn’t,’’ I began, but his face told me that we would just keep playing this game all night if I didn’t confess.

He placed a sheet of paper and pen on the low table. ‘‘If you confess and sign, you can go home,’’ he said.

I wanted to go home. So I relented. ‘‘Yes, I did it,’’ I said. ‘‘I took the bicycle.’’

He looked relieved. ‘‘Please wait a moment.’’ He left the room and returned with three of the officers. ‘‘Please sign,’’ he said, gesturing toward the paper.

I looked at it. The table was very low. And that’s when I realized: It wasn’t just about me saying sorry. It was about me feeling ashamed as well. I had read that Japan was a shame culture, rather than a guilt culture. Humiliation seemed to be the point here. I knelt at the table, my head bent over the paper, and signed. I began to cry. I did feel ashamed.

‘‘I am so sorry!’’ I said, looking up.

The officers looked satisfied. They even seemed to be smiling slightly. I was released.

Unstarched Shirt,"Photo

In 1925, when René Lacoste won both the French Championships and Wimbledon, he wore a starched white shirt with buttons extending all the way down the front and sleeves reaching to the wrists. In 1926, he won the United States National Championship wearing the same shirt but with its sleeves cut short: a daring evolutionary step toward an archetype of sportswear. In 1933, Lacoste went into business with a knitwear manufacturer to mass-produce la chemise Lacoste, a short-sleeved pullover with a turndown collar, three buttons on its placket and a breathable piqué-cotton body. Ads extolled its suitability not just for le tennis and le golf but also for la plage (the beach): not just for athletic exertion but for general leisure. The shirt was not rigid, but there was a rectitude to it. It promoted physical comfort while adhering to social strictures. The line from there to casual Friday runs fairly straight.

Lacoste once told People magazine that he derived inspiration from seeing one of his fancy friends, the fifth Marquess of Cholmondeley, take the court in the shirt he wore to play polo: ‘‘A practical idea, I thought to myself.’’ It is true that the polo shirt as we know it originated on the polo field, but it is also true, and telling, that the game’s name has attached itself to many other garments. If you check inside the collar of a Brooks Brothers oxford-cloth button-down, you will see it declared ‘‘the original polo shirt.’’ When you flip through 1940s newspapers, you will find boys’ knit-cotton crew necks promoted as ‘‘polo shirts.’’ What an American calls a turtleneck sweater, a Briton calls a polo-neck jumper. A camel’s-hair coat was, in the 1920s, a polo coat. The brand name Polo Ralph Lauren first materialized on a label, paying quiet tribute to customers’ Gatsby streaks, in 1967; Lauren did not hitch his pony and rider to a polo shirt until 1972.

The connotations of polo are elite but not effete. What is a polo player if not an aristocrat fused with a cowboy? And yet a ‘‘polo shirt’’ sounds somehow more approachable than a ‘‘tennis shirt,’’ probably because the equestrian game exists at such a ludicrous remove as to seem no more substantial than a mirage. The oddities attendant to the status of reappropriated symbols are delightfully rich. Ralph Lauren, born in 1939 as Ralph Lifshitz, has frequently been compelled to defend his trademark against the United States Polo Association, founded in 1890 as a sports organization. Entering the rag trade with its U.S. Polo Assn. line in 1981, the group aroused the ardent curiosity of Lauren’s legal team. Lawyers have met with limited success in arguing that polo (the institution) endeavors to ride the shirttails of Polo (the upstart) by selling shirts emblazoned with twice as many horses (and at half the price).

Meanwhile, Lacoste remains the brand emblematic of branding itself. Descended from the player’s personal insignia, the famous crocodile is sometimes claimed as the first commercial logo designed for display. Though that distinction more likely goes to the diving girl of Jantzen — the suit that, to believe its slogan, ‘‘changed bathing to swimming’’ in the 1920s — both symbols emerged from the same pool of ideas. The years between the wars marked the advent of purpose-designed sportswear and its slippage into the mainstream, guided by the new prestige of youthful vigor. Advances in technology abetted shifts in standards of decorum, and now here you are, wearing yoga pants out to dinner.

When the American company Izod brought the Lacoste shirt to the United States in the 1950s, offered in colors livelier than Wimbledon white, it assumed its destiny among preppies. To complete a costume radiating vernal energy, a fellow would pick one up at Brooks Brothers or at the Andover Shop, which once composed a bit of ad-copy doggerel rhyming ‘‘crocodile’’ with ‘‘signs of style.’’ In Philip Roth’s ‘‘Goodbye, Columbus,’’ Neil Klugman, of stifling Newark, meets Brenda Patimkin, of gilded Short Hills, at her country club, gets her number and picks her up at a tennis court to take her on a date. They chat, and when Neil has ceased to fume that Brenda said, ‘‘I go to school in Boston,’’ when she could have less coyly said ‘‘Radcliffe,’’ he checks out her threads: ‘‘There were two wet triangles on the back of her tiny-­collared white polo shirt, right where her wings would have been if she’d had a pair.’’ To match the phantom wings, she wears Bermuda shorts cinched with a tartan belt.",REAL
Joshua Oppenheimer Won’t Go Back to Indonesia,"Photo

Your first film, ‘‘The Act of Killing,’’ was a portrait of the perpetrators of the 1965 Indonesian genocide, in which perhaps a million people suspected of being Communists were killed. In your new film, ‘‘The Look of Silence,’’ you focus on the murder of a single victim, Ramli Rukun. What made his killing stand out? Ramli’s murder had witnesses. Tens of thousands of others in that region were taken to rivers and killed, their bodies left to drift out to sea. Ramli’s body was dumped on an oil-palm plantation. For survivors, talking about Ramli was a way of insisting that the genocide had actually happened.

‘‘Silence’’ focuses on Ramli’s brother, Adi Rukun, who was born after Ramli was killed. You tried in 2003 to make a film out of Adi’s quest to learn about his brother’s fate. What happened? Within three weeks, the Army threatened the Rukun family. Adi suggested that I try to film the perpetrators instead. When I approached them, they were immediately open and boastful about the worst details of the killings. It was as if I’d wandered into Germany 40 years after the Holocaust, only to find the Nazis still in power.

That led to the making of ‘‘Killing,’’ in which you encourage the perpetrators to re-enact their atrocities in the style of, for instance, Hollywood westerns. Some critics say this sensationalizes the genocide. I would say to them: The raison d’être of the western is to glorify genocide here in the United States — the slaughter of the Native Americans.

With the perpetrators still in power, how did you finally come to the conclusion it was safe to make this film with Adi? Because of ‘‘Killing,’’ which I had shot but which had not yet come out, I was well known for being close to the highest-ranking perpetrators in the country, including the vice president of the country and members of Parliament. This meant that the men Adi wanted to meet — his brother’s killers, who were regionally powerful but not nationally powerful — would have to think twice before physically attacking us. They did not want to offend their bosses. Of course, after ‘‘Killing’’ was released, many of these men now hate me.

But one of the greatest admirers of ‘‘Killing’’ is none other than its ‘‘star,’’ the mass murderer Anwar Congo, who called it ‘‘honest and true.’’ The movie ends with him breaking down and retching in horror over his crimes. Are you flattered or in some way unsettled by his praise? Anwar told me that through tears right after seeing the film. What more could I hope for than that the film would give him pause to look at himself in the mirror?

In ‘‘Silence,’’ we learn that one of Ramli’s killers chronicled the murder in an autobiographical comic book called ‘‘Dew of Blood.’’ What do you suppose possessed him to do this? I think that he, like every perpetrator I’ve met, is chased by a cloud of torment and horror that he spends his whole life running from. And yet, because the perpetrators have not been removed from power, they coat these bitter, rotten memories in the sweet rhetoric of the victor’s history. They boast about the grisliest details, because these are precisely the details that haunt them.

There is an extraordinary clip in ‘‘Silence’’ from a 1967 NBC News broadcast in which Indonesia is described as being ‘‘more beautiful without Communists.’’ How much responsibility do you think the West has for the genocide? A great deal. The United States provided the special radio system so the Army could coordinate the killings over the vast archipelago. A man named Bob Martens, who worked at the United States Embassy in Jakarta, was compiling lists of thousands of names of Indonesian public figures who might be opposed to the new regime and handed these lists over to the Indonesian government.

You have not returned to Indonesia since the release of ‘‘Killing.’’ Are you barred from entering? I could probably get into Indonesia without incident. I’m just not sure I would get out alive again.",REAL
Should I Respond to My Mechanic’s Racist Poster?,"Photo

I live in a small rural town. At the local garage, the owner has photocopied and displayed a poster that he apparently thinks is clever. It proclaims to picture the most useful cellphone to have with you — a handgun that has a cellphone keypad in its handle. It then names the cities where this might be useful, naming cities that are primarily African-American. The owner is a nice guy and not a virulent racist; he probably does not realize that the poster is offensive, or why it is overtly racist. How should I respond? NAME WITHHELD

Amy Bloom: The garage owner probably does realize that it’s offensive. That would be why he has the poster displayed. Now, he may not feel that it would be offensive to the people in the local garage who are going to be seeing it; he probably thinks that they will find it appealing, which is why he put it up. But the foundation of the appeal is racist.

It’s possible to play dumb and say, ‘‘Hey, what does that poster mean?’’ Then the garage owner will say, ‘‘It’s a joke.’’ And then you say: ‘‘Oh, it’s funny? What’s the joke?’’ If the response is heated and unpleasant, it’s probably time to go, but it might still be worth at least beginning a conversation about it.

Unfortunately, in my experience, most people are not like Eleanor Roosevelt, who took criticism of her own racism so seriously that she not only always apologized directly and promptly without any excuse, but would write to her family and her wide social circle to point out the offensive thing that she did or said and to encourage them not to do the same.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: One of the main mechanisms by which we’re making our culture less racist and sexist is by people calling one another out in various ways. Especially in the case of racism, it’s really important for white people to call out other white people when they do these things.

I don’t know enough about life in this small town to know the level of self-consciousness, but if the guy doesn’t realize that the poster is offensive, that’s a problem. It’s a problem for race relations in our country if people can put something like this up and never understand that there’s a racist element. We’re going to be able to do something about this only if we all agree in our separate ways, and from our different social positions, that we’re going to say to people — gently, at least to begin with — ‘‘What do you mean by that?’’ Just trying to explain why it’s funny will probably bring him to consciousness.",REAL
Eat a Peach,"Photo

It has been a season full of Prufrock for me: restless one-nighters in cheap hotels and sawdust restaurants with oyster shells. And of course I dare to eat a peach. It is the summer’s great fruit, soft and warm, slick beneath its fuzz, almost impossibly sweet, creamy with a slight acidic tang.

Eat a perfect peach under a punishing sun, and you’ll experience the fruit at its messy, dripping, sugar-bright best. Rinse your sticky chin, and understand that no melon can compete, no apricot, no blackberry, though they will try.

But how often does that happen, really? Those who live in South Carolina or Georgia will probably say, ‘‘A lot.’’ If you live by one of the great late-summer peach orchards of New Jersey or Long Island, you may enjoy more than your fair share. Those in California who can find peaches that aren’t bound for cans or the freezer aisles may find a few perfect peaches themselves. But for most of us, a truly great peach is a rare event. We can expect but one or two a season, for all our trying.

Enter the pie. A peach pie can elevate good peaches to excellence and great ones to sublimity. Even a peach pie made with frozen peaches is a terrific thing. The addition of sugar helps; so, too, do a dash of lemon juice and a light sprinkle of nutmeg, which offers a slight bitterness to offset the sweet. Add a crown of vanilla ice cream for a perfect diner-style, à la mode effect.

‘After a New Moon’,"Each evening you gaze in the southwest sky

as a crescent extends in argentine light.

When the moon was new, your mind was

desireless, but now both wax to the world.

While your neighbor’s field is cleared,

your corner plot is strewn with desiccated

sunflower stalks. You scrutinize the bare

apricot limbs that have never set fruit,

the wisteria that has never blossomed,

and wince, hearing how, at New Year’s,

teens bashed in a door and clubbed strangers.

Near a pond, someone kicks a dog out

of a pickup. Each second, a river edged

with ice shifts course. Last summer’s

exposed tractor tire is nearly buried

under silt. An owl lifts from a poplar,

while the moon, no, the human mind

moves from brightest bright to darkest dark.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: Hangovers,"Photo

I used to loathe hangovers. I used to keep my bedside table stacked with bananas, Pedialyte, do-­it-­yourself guides to bootleg saline. Home from nights out, I used to dis- and replace fluids with the verve of an undertaker. I tried every which way to delay the inevitable. Still I woke up hung over, of course. Blanched in the a.m. sun, feeling like death, I used to offer up that childish, transactional petition: I promise I’ll never do this again if you just make it hurt less.

This all changed when I published a book and went on a meager tour in support of it. Over the course of a few months, I traveled to strange places, got up in front of strange people, read from the same passage over and over again until the words went strange in my mouth. I was a ‘‘social drinker’’ most every night. Which is why lately I’ve begun to wonder whether hangovers, while certainly unpleasant, might have value. I’ve begun to think that they could be useful if deployed situationally. I’ve begun to believe that they’re so much more than just the hellish yin to drinking’s yang.

Achieving hangover is a quick, simple way to take one step back from everyday reality. How quick and how simple? A third or so of a $17 bottle of Old Overholt should suffice. Just enough to level off the fill line at the neckerchief of the Ned-­Beatty-­looking Whig on the label. Drink that over the course of two hours, possibly surreptitiously, possibly on the night train to Albany, and you’re halfway there.

And the next day? Do you not so much wake up as get ejected, gasping, into the too-­bright morning? Yes. Is there a dusty thudding inside your head? Of course. Does your mouth taste like a desert sin? We’re all adults here; we know from the physical chastisements of the hangover. But it’s the metaphysical insights opened up by these physical scourges that I’ve been reflecting on lately.

How to Conduct an Auction,"Photo

‘‘It’s the sound that sells,’’ says Brandon Neely, describing an auctioneer’s hard-­driving patter. Strive for a melodic chant that lulls your audience, even as it pushes them into fast-­paced bidding wars. Potential buyers should be able to ‘‘sit and listen to you all day without getting agitated,’’ says Neely, 29, of Southside, Ala., who auctions cattle, vehicles and farm equipment and was recently named this year’s winner at the World Livestock Auctioneer Championship in Clifton, Tex.

Start slowly, with words that feel comfortable on your tongue. Common phrasing for an amateur might be: ‘‘One-­dollar bidder, now two, would ya give me two? Now two-­dollar bid, now three, now three, would ya give me four?’’ Say it again, faster this time. Speed matters. Bidders lose their moorings in the relentless rhythm.

Study the market. An auctioneer should know an item’s worth before a sale begins, whether it’s a van Gogh painting or the price ­per ­pound for yearling cattle.

Because auctioneering is a profession best learned on the job, apprentice yourself. Neely went to his first auction as a 3-­year-­old, play­acted hawking his toys at 7 and had his first real mentor in eighth grade. He learned to warble by listening to former tobacco auctioneers, a particularly singsongy subset of the profession.

Learn to spot the serious buyers, the ones whose eyes linger on the product longest. Eventually, you will develop a sort of prescience. ‘‘You can feel where a bid is going to come from,’’ Neely says. Deliberate eye contact can sometimes prompt a bid from someone who is wavering. Adjust your pace and cadence to suit the mood and experience of the buyers. ‘‘If you have older folks at a charity event, you need to slow down,’’ Neely says.

Gesticulate. Rather than pointing to acknowledge a bid, which can be seen as rude, Neely flicks and twists his wrists like a dancer. ‘‘Your hands show you have control,’’ he says. ‘‘You’re the center of attention. To be an auctioneer, you have to want that.’’",REAL

RE: PSYCHOANALYSIS

Nearly a century after Sigmund Freud’s death, psychoanalysis is often seen as obsolete. Can brain-scanning help keep it relevant?

In the pursuit of understanding our human selves, science in the last few decades has entered many corridors that have essentially led to dead ends; it is embarrassing, even humbling, to admit such. As is admitting that those obsolete ideas have some relevancy. Yes, there might be a place for psychoanalysis, since it does something important: It gets humans talking, which is what might be the pathway to cures in a world that is, for many, socially isolating and alienating. I think that in 50 years, we will still be talking about Freud and his pioneering ideas of the human mind. Perry J Greenbaum, in a post on his personal blog

I am all for this research on neuropsychoanalysis, but as someone who has been on both sides of the couch, the power of the clinical work of psychoanalysis lies in what is happening between patient and analyst. The profundity of good psychoanalysis is how the analyst comes to know her patient consciously and unconsciously, and uses her conscious and unconscious thoughts and feelings to interpret or question the patient, leading to new connections and expanding experience for the patient. The patient-analyst dyad is actually altered by the changed emotional tone in the room. It is very powerful. This happens over and over again in good treatment. Now, this is not magic. Something is going in my brain and body and the patient’s brain and body. Let’s get the neuroscientists into the consulting room! Miri Abramis, posted on nytimes.com

The Man Who Saw America,"The tram entered a scruffy immigrant neighborhood not far from where Frank’s father, Hermann, had his business importing radios and record players, for which Hermann himself designed cabinets that Frank describes as ‘‘horrible.’’ Frank carried two rolls of film, but all the way out he only gazed out the window. He could have been anybody. Back in the 1950s, when Frank was making what amounted to private photographic studies in public places, one of his skills was remaining inconspicuous in casinos, restrooms and elevators. Here, near the end of the tram line, suddenly the camera appeared. There was a single click. Nothing beyond the window looked unusual. Then Frank pointed to a construction crane, its boom passing below a church steeple clock. ‘‘This is Zurich,’’ he explained. ‘‘The crane. The clock. The church. Functional.’’ It was the one picture of the day.

Sixty years ago, at the height of his powers, Frank left New York in a secondhand Ford and began the epic yearlong road trip that would become ‘‘The Americans,’’ a photographic survey of the inner life of the country that Peter Schjeldahl, art critic at The New Yorker, considers ‘‘one of the basic American masterpieces of any medium.’’ Frank hoped to express the emotional rhythms of the United States, to portray underlying realities and misgivings — how it felt to be wealthy, to be poor, to be in love, to be alone, to be young or old, to be black or white, to live along a country road or to walk a crowded sidewalk, to be overworked or sleeping in parks, to be a swaggering Southern couple or to be young and gay in New York, to be politicking or at prayer.

The book begins with a white woman at her window hidden behind a flag. That announcement — here are the American unseen — the Harvard photography historian Robin Kelsey likens to the splash of snare drum at the beginning of Bob Dylan’s ‘‘Like a Rolling Stone’’: ‘‘It flaps you right away.’’ The images that follow — a smoking industrial landscape in Butte, Mont.; a black nurse holding a porcelain-white baby or an unwatched black infant rolling off its blanket on the floor of a bar in South Carolina — were all different jolts of the same current. That is the miracle of great socially committed art: It addresses our sources of deepest unease, helps us to confront what we cannot organize or explain by making all of it unforgettable. ‘‘I think people like the book because it shows what people think about but don’t discuss,’’ Frank says. ‘‘It shows what’s on the edge of their mind.’’

On a trip upstate, Frank visited a Fourth of July celebration in rural Jay, N.Y., and photographed two girls in white dresses skipping beneath a huge, diaphanous American flag. ‘‘Something I really like is a big flag,’’ Frank says. ‘‘Here, people are so proud of it. In other countries you don’t feel they’re so proud of their flag.’’ Like most things with Frank, that cuts two ways. Foreign, uncompromisingly independent, Frank loathed the provincial prevarications of nostalgia. At closer inspection, the flag is torn, while along the photograph’s edge is the only visible face: a sneering boy. That the flag is transparent means that in ‘‘The Americans,’’ a reader looks, in effect, through the cloth to the image on the next page — to segregated New Orleans, where Frank made his best-known picture.

Frank passed through the city in 1955 and took a photograph of a row of passengers on a Canal Street trolley — whites in front, blacks in back. In the moment, life stilled into such clarity that Frank’s shutter needed to move only once. What he says attracted him then was something filmic: ‘‘Five people sitting, each occupying a frame.’’ But it’s a black man, his forehead creased, whose complex expression makes the picture. ‘‘He’s looked at that street many times,’’ Frank says. Plenty of photographs were taken during Jim Crow. Frank’s gift was to transcend reportage and tell you something about the condition — how oppression felt.

When Frank began his expedition upriver into the heart of American ambivalence, photography remained, as Walker Evans said, ‘‘a disdained medium.’’ Only a few American art museums collected photographs. Most of the published images portrayed figures of status. One notable exception was the work of Dorothea Lange. Frank respected her compassion but considered her Dust Bowl pictures maudlin — triumphalist takes on adversity. ‘‘I photographed people who were held back, who never could step over a certain line,’’ he says. ‘‘My mother asked me, ‘Why do you always take pictures of poor people?’ It wasn’t true, but my sympathies were with people who struggled. There was also my mistrust of people who made the rules.’’ That impulse seems particularly potent today, during our charged national moment — our time of belated reckoning with how violent, enraged, unbalanced and unjust the United States often still is. To look again at the photographs Frank made before Selma, Vietnam and Stonewall, before income inequality, iPhones and ‘‘I can’t breathe,’’ is to realize he recognized us before we recognized ourselves.

Photo

Frank grew up in ‘‘a sad household.’’ In the 1930s, Zurich radio was full of Hitler. ‘‘That voice cursing the Jews,’’ he says. ‘‘You couldn’t turn off the voice.’’ Hermann Frank had been an excellent Sunday photographer, but securing the material comforts of Persian carpets and fine goose liver was his priority. ‘‘My father married my mother because of money. It became the most important thing in order for them to feel good. If my father had a good day, dinner would end and my father would take out his wallet and give my mother 100 Swiss francs.’’ Frank was repelled: ‘‘I was driven by negative influence. I wanted to get away.’’

In 1947, family friends who lived in Queens met the boat that carried Frank to the United States. The next day, they showed him Times Square: ‘‘The crowd! The crowd! I never was used to such a big crowd, and they were so enthusiastic about being there. It was America! Those big signs!’’ At a coffee shop, Frank encountered a waitress who flung everyone’s silverware onto the table. In that moment of democratic informality, Frank knew New York was where he wanted to be. ‘‘In Paris you’d see African people on the subway, and they were African. Here in America they are Americans. There is no other place like this.’’

The sheer diversity and scale of the United States thrilled Frank. ‘‘It’s a big country,’’ he says. ‘‘Coming from Switzerland, it’s vast.’’ Because there was such freedom of mobility, he could go many places, and in all of them he saw heightened experience — including, to his surprise, the masses of people who ‘‘looked desperate.’’ Some, like him, were getting by, but for many others the American promise never took. Early on in New York he met a former soldier who ‘‘would wear his uniform from the Marines every day. Even though he was not in the Marines anymore. He asked me to rent a place with him. I did for a few months. He didn’t have a job. Nice man. Lost. They get lost.’’

Frank got commercial photography assignments from magazines like Harper’s Bazaar while also roaming around New York, following ‘‘my own feelings.’’ His way of living resisted convention —‘‘I never worried about insurance’’— as did his work. For American photographers at the time, the professional apotheosis was Life magazine. Henry Luce, the publisher, favored linear, neatly partisan narratives, and Life’s editors repeatedly rejected Frank. Frank’s photographs suggested life was more fraught: ‘‘I leave it up to you,’’ he says. ‘‘They don’t have an end or a beginning. They’re a piece of the middle.’’

Frank was also passed over by Magnum, the elite consortium of photographers led by Robert Capa: ‘‘Capa said my pictures were too horizontal, and magazines were vertical.’’ The photographer Elliott Erwitt knew Frank then and says, ‘‘It was the beginning of that kind of photography that Robert did, seemingly sloppy, but not — and very emotional. The acceptable pictures then were sharp and technically excellent. But the pictures of Robert Frank were very different.’’ To Frank, the French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson’s idea of a ‘‘decisive moment’’ in photography seemed reductive. Frank was in search of ‘‘some moment I couldn’t explain,’’ and periodically went off on his own to make pictures of Peruvian farmers, Welsh miners and French street children. His unwillingness to compromise led to breaks with friends like Erwitt. ‘‘I became a professional doing what people expected from me,’’ Erwitt says. ‘‘We all respected Robert’s talent and ability and knew he was difficult and fought with everyone — could be quite vindictive with some. We just dissolved the friendship. I felt he felt I’d gone the wrong way, the nonartist way.’’

In the late 1940s, Frank met a teenage dance and art student named Mary Lockspeiser, whose pale eyes and luminous complexion were perhaps especially compelling to a man who saw the world in black and white. ‘‘She was young, but I thought, Why not?’’ says Frank, who was nine years older. ‘‘She was alive for everything.’’ They married, and had two children: Pablo, named, he says, after the cellist Pablo Casals, and Andrea — ‘‘She was named for a boat that sank.’’ His sense of humor is just black enough that you wonder when he’s joking.

The family lived, as Mary put it in an interview with the Smithsonian Institution, ‘‘very chaotically in every way.’’ They scavenged the sidewalks for furnishings and inhabited desolate, formerly industrial downtown neighborhoods. The Franks were young artists, and struggled as parents; Pablo and Andrea were often left to themselves. ‘‘I felt we weren’t made for it,” Frank says. Mary was ‘‘a young woman who wanted to work, and I was running after my career,” he says, adding that ‘‘it was very, very hard, almost impossible to live with me.’’

Frank absorbed artistic influences all over New York. Edward Hopper’s moody office-scapes, restaurant interiors and gas pumps were not in fashion when Frank discovered the painter: ‘‘So clear and so decisive. The human form in it. You look twice — what’s this guy waiting for? What’s he looking at? The simplicity of two facing each other. A man in a chair.’’ Frank’s creative day to day was informed by the Abstract Expressionist painters he lived among. Through his window, Frank studied Willem de Kooning pacing his studio in his underwear, pausing at his easel and then walking the floor some more. ‘‘I was a very silent unobserved watcher of this man at work. It meant a lot to me. It encouraged me to pace up and down and struggle.’’ He also saw the downside of an artist’s life: ‘‘I used to watch de Kooning work, and then I’d walk down the street and see him drinking and lying in the gutter. Somebody’s bringing him upstairs. You drink because you have doubts. Things seem to crumble around you.’’

Photo

Since there ‘‘weren’t so many artists in photography to meet,’’ Frank says, he became interested in the work of only one photographer: Walker Evans. Evans’s images of battered roadside prewar America were, as the photographer Tod Papageorge writes, Frank’s ‘‘sourcebook’’ for his own rendition of the American scene. Frank sought Evans out, and soon the older man was inviting Frank to his Upper East Side apartment to help him photograph objects like tools arranged on a table. ‘‘If I put a piece of cheese on the table and said, ‘Photograph it,’ ’’ Frank says, ‘‘his would be different from my piece of cheese. His pictures were more careful. I was fast. Hurry! Hurry! Life goes fast.’’

Evans wore English shoes and patrician airs. Frank had become close to raffish Beats like the poet Allen Ginsberg, and when Evans was hospitalized, he asked Frank not to bring ‘‘any of those friends of yours up here.’’ Frank believed that despite the humanity in his pictures, Evans ‘‘felt he was better than other people. That was something I couldn’t stand.’’

Evans admired talent, and he became Frank’s champion, encouraging him to complete a Guggenheim application to support the photographic journey that would become ‘‘The Americans.’’ Evans wrote him a recommendation, calling him ‘‘a born artist,’’ and helped plan his itinerary.

Frank left his family behind in 1955 and went off to see Miami, Los Angeles and 10,000 miles in between through the windshield of a black Ford Business Coupe. He packed two cameras, many boxes of film (kept in a bag to protect them from the sun), trunks, French brandy (‘‘Sometimes you need a little drink; it changes your attitude’’), AAA road atlases and one book, which was really a map of another kind, Evans’s ‘‘American Photographs.’’ Evans and others had suggested destinations like the Gullah communities of the south Atlantic coast, but Frank was often spontaneous.

Photo

The first destination was Michigan. ‘‘I went to Detroit to photograph the Ford factories, and then it was clear to me I wanted to do this. It was summer and so loud. So much noise. So much heat. It was hell. So much screaming.’’

As Frank searched for pictures, he stayed in cheap motels: ‘‘You’d always find them down by the river.’’ The first stop in a new town was usually a Woolworth’s department store. His favored shooting settings were public — sidewalks, political rallies, drive-ins, churches, parks. He wanted to find the men and women others would consider unremarkable, as well as the symbols and objects that defined them. Falling into a place-to-place rhythm, he took pictures of bystanders, vagrants, newlyweds, Christian crosses, jukeboxes, mailboxes, coffins, televisions, many cars, and those many flags.

It was an investigation, and in every frame there is pent-up atmosphere, pressure in the air, a sense of somebody’s impending exposure — maybe Frank’s. ‘‘Photography can reveal so much. It’s the invasion of the privacy of the people.’’ Accordingly, there was an element of tradecraft. ‘‘I felt like a detective or a spy. Yes! Often I had uncomfortable moments. Nobody gave me a hard time, because I had a talent for not being noticed.’’

He was neither tall nor short, did not appear to maintain regular relations with razors, scissors or blankets and dressed in a way that brought to mind the bottom of a suitcase — ‘‘I didn’t change clothes too much.’’ The Ford fit the man. ‘‘I loved that car. It was like any car, inconspicuous,’’ he says. ‘‘I called it Luce — the only connection I ever had with Mr. Henry Luce.’’

Photo

Years later, the photographer and curator Philip Brookman learned just how committed Frank was to making pictures. The two men were visiting Frank’s troubled son Pablo on Thanksgiving at a psychiatric hospital. Many families were there. At one point a patient sang a very clear and beautiful song she called ‘‘Sad Movie.’’ Brookman, moved, crept his hand toward his camera, but he worried that taking a photo would be inappropriate. As the moment passed, he heard a familiar, gruff voice: ‘‘You should have taken it.’’

When Frank raised his camera and shot, the process was blurry quick, meaning he could capture what he saw as he perceived it. People, Frank says, ‘‘don’t like to be caught in private moments. I think private moments make the interesting picture.’’ It says something about Frank that his favorite ‘‘Americans’’ photograph shows the only people who caught him in the act. A black couple resting on the grass in a San Francisco park looks toward the lens in outrage. Beyond them are white city buildings. What is conveyed is how it feels to be violated wherever you go.

Frank says he was most drawn to blacks: the bare-chested boy in the back of a convertible; the woman relaxing beside a field in sunny Carolina cotton country; the dignified men outside the funeral of a South Carolina undertaker, who uncannily bring to mind the day President Obama eulogized Clementa Pinckney. At first, the South was to him ‘‘very exotic — a life I knew nothing about.’’ Then, in November 1955, Frank was traversing the Arkansas side of the Mississippi River, ‘‘just whistling my song and driving on,’’ as he says, when a patrol car pulled him over outside McGehee. The policemen’s report noted that Frank needed a bath and that ‘‘subject talked with a foreign accent.’’ Also suspicious were the contents of the car: cameras, foreign liquor. Frank was on his way to photograph oil refineries in Louisiana. ‘‘Are you a Commie?’’ he was asked.

Ten weeks earlier, Emmett Till was murdered a hundred miles away. ‘‘In Arkansas,’’ Frank recalls, ‘‘the cops pulled me in. They locked me in a cell. I thought, Jesus Christ, nobody knows I’m here. They can do anything. They were primitive.’’ Across the room, Frank could see ‘‘a young black girl sitting there watching. Very wonderful face. You see in her eyes she’s thinking, What are they gonna do?’’ Because his camera had been confiscated, Frank considers the girl his missing ‘‘Americans’’ photograph. Around midnight a policeman told Frank he had 10 minutes to get across the river. ‘‘That trip I got to like black people so much more than white people.’’

Photo

Coming to America after growing up listening to tyranny on the radio, Frank had been foremost a grateful émigré, and early pictures suggested it. Now, through a lens, the country darkened, and Frank became, the photographer Eugene Richards says, ‘‘a loaded gun.’’ Four days later, in New Orleans, Frank photographed the line of faces looking through the trolley windows. Once he saw that girl in McGehee, he says, he knew what to look for.

As he drove, Frank was in the grip-flow of his imagination, finding pictures everywhere, so many pictures that he now says of the period: ‘‘You don’t have it that good all the time. I was on the case.’’ Occasional hitchhikers advised Frank where to go next and spelled him behind the wheel while he slept in the back seat or quietly raised up and snapped their pictures, as he did on U.S. 91 outside Blackfoot, Idaho. Sometimes he gave people rides — workers, prostitutes — but Frank did not seek personal connections. ‘‘The people in ‘The Americans,’ I watched,” he said, adding, ‘‘I wanted to take the picture and walk away.’’

One ‘‘Americans’’ photograph came from a dimly lit New Mexico gutbucket: ‘‘It was a tough bar. You had to shoot from your hip.’’ In Elko, Nev., Frank photographed the play at a gaming table: ‘‘It’s very seldom you get a picture of people gambling. The management and the gamblers don’t want you to take pictures because they have wives. Or mothers! Or grandmothers! Or daughters!’’ At political gatherings, where credentials were required for admission, Frank was not above filching some from a stranger’s jacket.

You could operate that way if you were on your own, but Frank was married, and those years were hard on the family. In photographs from the 1950s, the children are inevitably bright-eyed, Mary is distantly aglow and Frank grim. From the road Frank wrote to Mary, ‘‘Your letters are often sad.’’ When they all met up in Texas and drove west for a few weeks, Frank found it ‘‘stressful. You go out, you’re gone. You come back, you’re tired. You’ve hunted for pictures. You want peace.’’ His family became the subject of his book’s wistful last photograph. Taken from in front of the car through the windshield, weary, overwhelmed faces and half the Ford are visible. ‘‘It’s personal, it’s melancholy, it’s sentimentality — all the things you try to stay away from. Also, I’m the person who’s not there. This is what it takes, the picture says.’’

Photo

Frank took more than 27,000 photographs. Returning to New York, he sequenced the best 83 into what he thought of as a film on paper. Walker Evans wrote him an introduction to help place it. But who would publish images of groping teenagers, drifters, cross-dressers, poor blacks, a harassed mother? At first, only Robert Delpire in Paris would. Frank’s inability to find an American publisher frustrated him. He came to feel he needed a more like-minded advocate. So, Frank says, ‘‘I turned to Kerouac.’’

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

It was early September 1957 when Frank heard about ‘‘On the Road,’’ a novel that had just been praised in The New York Times as ‘‘the most important utterance yet made by the generation.’’ Frank ‘‘liked the speed of it, taking you back and forth across the country, his descriptions of the landscape in the morning, the little towns, which he describes with such exquisite beauty — the love for America.’’

He found Kerouac ‘‘at a New York party where poets and Beatniks were. Some painters. Everything happened downtown.’’ When Frank showed the writer his pictures, Frank says he was empathetic. ‘‘Kerouac personified what I hoped I’d find here in America. He was interested in outsiders. He wasn’t interested in walking the middle of the road.’’ Seizing the moment, Frank asked if Kerouac would introduce ‘‘The Americans.’’ ‘‘Sure,’’ Kerouac said. ‘‘I’ll write something.’’

One reason many other artists believe, as Nan Goldin says, that Frank ‘‘has never taken a false step’’ is that Frank always puts art above sentiment. ‘‘I try to get out of sentiment’s way when it comes near me. A few steps backward and to the left and don’t look back.’’ Frank says there was no hesitation about jilting Evans for Kerouac, but informing his mentor that he was forsaking him for Kerouac ‘‘was a difficult moment.’’ He says Evans’s essay was ‘‘too flowery and made no sense,’’ adding, ‘‘The friendship survived, but that was it. Never mentioned again.’’ Their relationship became ‘‘colder and more distant.’’

Frank admired Kerouac’s propulsive methods: ‘‘He lay on the floor all evening long. He’d write 20 pages about it the next morning.’’ Introducing ‘‘The Americans,’’ Kerouac told a reader nothing about Frank’s biography. Instead, he supplied an ecstasy of overture: ‘‘With one hand he sucked a sad poem of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world.’’

Yet ‘‘The Americans’’ was initially unappreciated in the United States. The editors of Popular Photography derided Frank’s ‘‘warped,’’ ‘‘wart-covered’’ ‘‘images of hate.’’ That the photographs were blurry, asymmetrical, shot at oblique angles and deliberately informal attracted more screeds. The problem was, as the critic Janet Malcolm would later explain, ‘‘no one had ever made pictures like that before.’’

At first, it was other American artists who were enthralled. Out in Los Angeles, Ed Ruscha was sitting in an art-student cafe when a classmate brought in a brand-new copy of the book. Suddenly ‘‘there weren’t enough chairs for everyone; we were craning our necks, looking at it page by page. It’s like — You know where you were when John F. Kennedy was shot? I know where I was when I saw ‘The Americans.’ ’’ For Ruscha, in Frank’s hands the camera became a new kind of machine. ‘‘I was aware of Walker Evans’s work. But I felt like those were still lives. Robert’s work was life in motion.’’

Frank was not yet well known, but he and Mary were a glamorous couple at the crossroads of the New York arts scene. He personally was a camera, a tough, sensual receptor with an enticing remove that made others draw near. The people Frank admired were judgmental, unpredictable artists who satisfied his need for heightened experience. The jazz musician Ornette Coleman ‘‘didn’t like many things — a very hard critic,’’ while the filmmaker and musicologist Harry Smith lived to insult people, lit fires, yelled ‘‘Heil Hitler’’ in Jewish restaurants and yet was ‘‘the only genius I ever met. He was open to how people could reveal something for other people,’’ Frank says. ‘‘He lived uptown like a hermit, all alone with all his windows closed.’’

Photo

Among photographers, Frank considered Diane Arbus ‘‘a special woman! I went to her house. She was eating something. She said, ‘Do you want some?’ I said, ‘Sure.’ I took a bite. Almost impossible to eat. She said, ‘Yeah, I put too much salt in.’ She wanted to see my reaction. Why not? I liked her work. You could say, This is Diane Arbus.’’

Frank was closest to Ginsberg, Kerouac and their circle, and says he was inspired by Ginsberg’s relationship with the poet Peter Orlovsky: ‘‘Of course they were lovers, but he learned a lot about freedom from Orlovsky. They could live on the edge of society, the edge of American behavior. They made me want to be freer.’’ Frank would sit clothed in a room full of naked, stoned men as Ginsberg read from poems like ‘‘Kaddish.’’ ‘‘It’s wonderful to fall in with a group like that. You watch them live, and it’s so different from what you’d seen. Their art, their sexual lives, what truth they believed and preached and wrote. Ginsberg was a real prophet. He saw a different, more accepting America.’’

Frank once chauffeured Kerouac and his mother from Florida to Long Island; the author of ‘‘On The Road’’ didn’t drive. ‘‘It’s a better way to find out about the world if you don’t. He was true talent. He had a sad end. He couldn’t handle his fame. It drove him into a corner, made him drink, want to forget.’’ Frank found closer personal understanding with James Agee than he did with Evans, Agee’s collaborator on ‘‘Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,’’ and yet, Agee, too, was ‘‘always sweating and drinking, always a bottle close by. He was one of the saddest people I met, one of the suffering men.’’

When he wasn’t interested in someone, Frank could be pitiless. ‘‘I’m friendlier now. I had no patience.’’ He roiled with brutal standards: ‘‘In Provincetown, a guy showed me his pictures and asked me what I thought. I tore them up. Now I hate myself for that. Then I had to.’’

One day the painter Mark Rothko invited Frank to his studio for a talk. It was a dark space with only a row of windows on the ceiling because, Frank says, Rothko ‘‘liked the light to come in different colors. He had a daughter he worried about. He asked for advice on young people. I said I couldn’t help him.’’

Being an artist, husband and father continued to be arduous for Frank. During the ’60s, he seemed tired, angry and beaten-down to friends like the filmmaker Jonas Mekas, who recalls Mary once stopping him on the street to ask if she could borrow a dollar for groceries. The marriage struggled. But at the same time, Frank’s achievement was slowly becoming understood, a momentum that continues. The best photographers today, like Paul Graham, consider it still revelatory that someone could shape the endless onrush of American experience into a full portrait of the country. Frank’s book, Graham says, ‘‘expresses a yearning in us all to find meaning and a pattern, a form to life.’’

Among the many qualities that enabled Frank to achieve something so ambitious was his profound ambivalence. He was always that way personally, and it was how he could locate the full spectrum of any given feeling in the inscrutable faces of strangers. Critics like W.S. Di Piero believe his genius for expressing emotional complication came from an artistic innocence, the ability to look at the world as a child does — without the intrusions of experience. When June Leaf, Frank’s wife of 40 years, discussed with me this way of her husband’s seeing, she described being shown by his aunt a picture of Frank as little boy. ‘‘I looked at it, and I thought to myself, That’s exactly the same expression he has now: ‘What is going on here?’ That’s the secret of his perception of the world. And that’s ‘The Americans.’ That marvelous perception comes into the room. It’s ‘What is going on here?’ None of us know until he takes a photograph. Other than the photograph, he doesn’t know what is going on.’’

Over the years, ‘‘The Americans’’ would follow the trajectory of experimental American classics like ‘‘Moby-Dick’’ and ‘‘Citizen Kane’’ — works that grew slowly in stature until it was as if they had always been there. To Bruce Springsteen, who keeps copies of ‘‘The Americans’’ around his home for songwriting motivation, ‘‘the photographs are still shocking. It created an entire American identity, that single book. To me, it’s Dylan’s ‘Highway 61,’ the visual equivalent of that record. It’s an 83-picture book that has 27,000 pictures in it. That’s why ‘Highway 61’ is powerful. It’s nine songs with 12,000 songs in them. We’re all in the business of catching things. Sometimes we catch something. He just caught all of it.’’

As ‘‘The Americans’’ thrived, Frank’s success weighed on him. In the early 1970s, his friend the photographer Edward Grazda received a piece of mail from Frank written on a scrap of ledger paper. The postmark was the remote mining village in Nova Scotia where Frank and his new companion, Leaf, had escaped the admirers clamoring outside his New York door. ‘‘Ed, I’m famous,’’ it read. ‘‘Now what?’’

Rare is the great figure — Marcel Duchamp, Jim Brown — who departs at the top of his game. That the man who made ‘‘The Americans’’ would leave photography was such a shocking decision that people in the arts still speculate about it. ‘‘He was painfully compassionate,’’ Peter Schjeldahl says. ‘‘Maybe he didn’t want the pain anymore.’’

Frank put it this way in 1969: ‘‘Once respectability and success become a part of it, then it was time to look for a new mistress.’’ He says now that the issue was creative fulfillment: ‘‘I didn’t want to repeat myself. It’s too easy. It’s a struggle, such a struggle to make something good, to satisfy yourself. That was relatively easy for me in photography. It’s immediate recompense. You’ve achieved what you set out to achieve.’’ The composer David Amram, a friend of Frank’s, says, ‘‘The last thing he wanted to be was what Miles Davis called a human jukebox — always be what made him popular.’’

In 1959, even as Barney Rosset, the American publisher of literary renegades like Henry Miller and D.H. Lawrence, released ‘‘The Americans,’’ Frank decided to ‘‘put my Leica in the cupboard’’ and began filming a silent movie with his downtown neighbor, the painter Alfred Leslie. ‘‘Pull My Daisy’’ adapts a scene from Kerouac’s never-finished play, ‘‘The Beat Generation,’’ into a proto-‘‘Seinfeld’’ shaggy-dog story. A railway brakeman and his artist wife host a church bishop for dinner, which is disrupted by a visit from a group of fizzed-up hipster impresarios who settle in to riff the night away.

Leslie’s loft was used as a set; their friends were the actors: Ginsberg, painters like Larry Rivers and Alice Neel and a cameo for the adorable Pablo Frank. Amram, who composed the music, recalls the shoots as ‘‘an insane party; everybody being juvenile and nuts. Leslie was a hostage negotiator — ‘Allen, if you’d please put your pants back on!’ ’’ Frank remembers Kerouac filling up on applejack and carrying on until he fell asleep. Later he ad-libbed the narration in three increasingly inebriated takes.

‘‘Pull My Daisy’’ was indie cinema before indie existed, the pure underground. There was scarcely any budget; the paychecks are still in the mail; only college students and avant-garde cineastes knew the film existed. But it endures as a cultural document — here were the Beats — and because nobody had ever seen anything like it. ‘‘If that came out of ‘The Americans,’ that’s a giant step,’’ Ed Ruscha says. ‘‘It’s almost totally different. I felt like it was guys on a hijinx. Films were usually professional enterprises done in Hollywood. This was choppy and crude and gutsy.’’ When Frank invited friends to a screening, he says, ‘‘they were happy somebody looked at the world in a different way.’’ Viewers still feel similarly, which pleases Frank, ‘‘especially because people didn’t really like my later films.’’

Across the next 40 years, Frank would release 31 mostly short, genre-eluding, quasi-documentary movies that met with even less success than ‘‘Pull My Daisy.’’ He says that working outside the studio system, operating ‘‘completely against the rules of how you made a film,’’ was challenging. And yet he filmed work that was, Jonas Mekas says, ‘‘very important. Same as Andy Warhol, he comes with his own world, his own sensibility, his own style.’’ The projects attracted a range of actors (Christopher Walken, Joseph Chaikin, Joe Strummer) and co-writers (Sam Shepard, Rudy Wurlitzer). Frank’s subjects were recondite: a book signing for a writer who never turns up; a day in the life of a country letter carrier. Another, about indigenous American music, strayed and became a film about Frank. As Laura Israel, Frank’s longtime film editor, says, ‘‘He’s all about the detour.’’

Frank also made a series of jagged, strangely absorbing personal films about friends and family that were so unlike anything preceding them that collectively they constituted a small documentary wave of their own. Three were about Pablo, a fragile, tortured adult whose life was increasingly derailed by schizophrenia. Another film, ‘‘Me and My Brother,’’ began as an adaptation of Ginsberg’s poem ‘‘Kaddish’’ and then, following the familiar digressive pattern, became an account of Peter Orlovsky’s relationship with his schizophrenic brother, Julius. Frank explains that he was always drawn to extremes: ‘‘There can be good extremes, but I had more connection with the other half.’’ And Julius, Frank felt, ‘‘was on the edge of something. I felt he would calm down and tell what it was like to be in this place.’’ Frank considered his filmmaking career ‘‘a failure,’’ because ‘‘often I don’t want to reveal. But because it wasn’t going well it kept me going.’’ Defeat perversely encouraged Frank; he liked what he couldn’t do. Except that he could.

Frank’s most celebrated turn as a filmmaker came in 1972 when the Rolling Stones, in Los Angeles completing their album ‘‘Exile on Main Street,’’ invited him to photograph them for the cover. The musician who most influenced Frank’s work was Bob Dylan, who so frequently reinvented himself: ‘‘Dylan has the talents to move on.’’ But Keith Richards, Mick Jagger and the rest of the Stones were the world’s most celebrated outsiders, unregenerate avatars for collecting transgressive impulses into hits. At a fleabag Los Angeles inn, Frank recalls, they were instantly themselves. ‘‘Jagger said, ‘Let’s rent a room.’ I sat them down in chairs and made them use hotel furniture. That’s their life. Hotel rooms. Hotel rooms and polish.’’

The band was soon to go on tour, and they invited Frank and his Super-8 along. In the resulting film, ‘‘[expletive] Blues,’’ the band and its entourage are becalmed travelers ordering room service, gargling, masturbating, getting it on with drugs and groupies, moving through places they have no connection to, looking for ways to overcome lethargy and longueur. Frank now says of the experience: ‘‘I didn’t care about the music. I cared about them. It was great to watch them — the excitement. But my job was after the show. What I was photographing was a kind of boredom. It’s so difficult being famous. It’s a horrendous life. Everyone wants to get something from you.’’

Frank showed Jagger a rough cut. ‘‘He looked at it and then he said, ‘Richards came out better than me.’ Probably was right.’’ Richards agrees, of course: ‘‘One of Mick’s hangups is himself. Robert made the better man win! It’s a very true documentation of what went down.’’

The Stones’ lawyers worried that the explicitness would create problems and forbade screening it unless Frank was in attendance. As a result, the all-but-unavailable ‘‘Blues’’ is a celluloid apparition. The novelist Don DeLillo watched a cheap bootleg reproduction. He’d admired Frank’s photographs for the way they ‘‘imply a story or a sociology,’’ but the film, De­Lillo thought, was different. ‘‘There’s nothing behind it. There’s something pure.’’ In DeLillo’s ‘‘Underworld,’’ as characters view the film, De­Lillo describes at length its crepuscular, edge-of-time feeling.

Since the 1970s, Frank’s subversive approach has made him a godfather to young filmmakers. ‘‘The strength of his films is in what he says is problematic,’’ Jim Jarmusch says. ‘‘The beauty is they don’t satisfy certain narrative conventions.’’ Out in Texas in 1995, Richard Linklater was just beginning his film career when he staged a Frank retrospective at a theater in Austin. ‘‘If Robert Frank weren’t so acclaimed as one of the most influential photographers of all time, he’d have a much larger profile as an American indie filmmaking icon,’’ Linklater says. ‘‘It seems our culture struggles with the idea that someone could be that groundbreaking in more than one area. If it were just the films, I think he’d be credited as a founding father of the personal film.’’ He adds: ‘‘Beyond that, there’s this tremendous range of a restless, searching artist pushing the boundaries of the documentary, experimental and more traditional narrative forms.’’

During his 1969 short documentary, ‘‘Conversations in Vermont,’’ Frank portrays Pablo and Andrea confronting their youth spent growing up with a mother and father who put their art first. ‘‘You always said you wanted normal parents,’’ Frank challenges his children. That same year, Frank and Mary separated and Frank immediately began life with Mary’s friend June Leaf.

Overwhelmed in New York, craving ‘‘peace,’’ Frank asked Leaf to go to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, to find them a home. It was winter. She bought a pair of thick boots and flew north: ‘‘He knew I’d do anything for him,’’ she says now.

They moved to Mabou, where the March wind was so strong you had to walk backward. They knew nobody, and the house they’d purchased overlooking the sea was, in the local expression, ‘‘after falling down.’’ As a young woman, Leaf was given a prestigious Paris studio to work in, and now in Mabou, she found she had sufficient inner creative stamina to make art in what her husband calls ‘‘a sad landscape’’ where ‘‘the sheep ate all the trees.’’

Rebuilding the house became their creative collaboration. ‘‘You learned a completely different rhythm of life,’’ Frank says. ‘‘It has to do with keeping warm and getting your food. That occupies most of your time. It’s severe. With time we found two friends.’’

Soon came devastation. Frank’s daughter, Andrea, aspired to become a teacher and a midwife. She was radiant, with flashing, dark eyes that infatuated Frank’s young photographer friends. Leaf likens her to Frank himself: ‘‘marvelous, like him. She intimidated people because she made everybody want her to love them. She was so similar to him — stern, critical, sexy, tough. Very tough. She was interested in life!’’ In 1974, Andrea died in a plane crash. She was 20.

Frank went immediately to the United States, leaving Leaf alone and wretched on a Nova Scotia island in winter, frightened that Frank would no longer love her because she could not fully share his grief.

Within a year of Andrea’s death, Pablo had cancer as well as schizophrenia. ‘‘Pablo,’’ Leaf says, ‘‘was a bird, a butterfly. The drugs he later took and the death of his sister pushed him over the edge into illness. That changed Robert incredibly, slowly, agonizingly. He became a sweet father to Pablo, where before he’d been explosive. Very critical, dictatorial, authoritarian, like many European fathers. Pablo was so ethereal, funny, charming, sweet. The illness made Robert a better father. He had to be.’’

For many years after leaving New York, Frank remained relentlessly productive; he made films and resumed taking photographs, personal images of a very different style from street photography. In 1972, a Japanese first-time publisher named Kazuhiko Motomura collaborated with Frank on ‘‘The Lines of My Hand.’’ An expanded American edition was published in 1989, and became a book crucial to American photographers. Jim Goldberg describes it as ‘‘a road map for the rest of us.’’ Many of the most powerful pictures are of Pablo, his face ravaged by illness. Photographs are distressed, dripping with tears of paint, rived with scratched-out messages. Of his son, Frank writes: ‘‘What a hard life we have together. I can’t take it.’’

In and out of institutions, Pablo committed suicide in 1994. ‘‘Robert was always attracted to mad people like Julius Orlovsky,’’ Leaf says, ‘‘because he had nothing of that in him. So it’s fate, isn’t it, Pablo.’’ Eventually, Frank gave in to grief. ‘‘It takes concentration for me to work and the wish to succeed,’’ Frank says. ‘‘I didn’t have it anymore.’’ With such loss, he said, ‘‘you have to cope every day, and it doesn’t go away. You try hard to find some peace and acceptance.’’

Frank dislikes talking about any of it: ‘‘It’s not good to look back too much. It’s often sad. Better to look forward.’’ I felt I should ask him about Leaf’s descriptions of his children. He didn’t disagree with anything she’d said. Then he sighed: ‘‘I could’ve helped him. He would’ve needed another family. A real mother, a real father to take care of him. I think about that too often, because it’s too late.’’

Frank and Leaf now live most of the year in a building off the Bowery that has open hearths and rough surfaces and feels like a vertical farmhouse, a Manhattan version of Mabou. In a neighborhood now awash in tony boîtes and boutiques, Frank and Leaf are remnants of vanished bohemian New York. In Frank’s musty basement studio, amid a jumble of contact sheets, Camus novels, toy crocodiles and checkerboards, ‘‘EAT’’ is scrawled on the wall in yellow. ‘‘Patti Smith wrote that,’’ he says.

Visitors are always stopping by. Leaf receives them bright-eyed — ‘‘I’m a bouncy!’’ Frank watches warily, but with an eyebrow raised. ‘‘He’s always waiting for something extraordinary,’’ Leaf says. Frank and Leaf married in 1975, while passing through Reno, Nev., an echo to the eloping couple in ‘‘The Americans.’’ Over the years Leaf has developed what she calls ‘‘a bad habit of studying Robert.’’ Once she asked me, ‘‘Do you think Robert’s elusive?’’ Instead, Frank answered: ‘‘I used to be. I didn’t like to explain anything.’’

‘‘You still don’t,’’ she said, ‘‘and you don’t like things to be explained, and I’m a great explainer. It’s a miracle we lasted this long!’’ At 85, Leaf has a grave, mystical face that resembles Georgia O’Keeffe’s. She sees her husband clearly — ‘‘You have no idea how mean Robert can be’’ — and with delight. In Philip Brookman’s 1986 documentary on Frank, ‘‘Fire in the East,’’ Leaf says: ‘‘He goes through life in this wonderful secret way, in the water, under the water. And things just come to him. So he’s like a fish, a beautiful fish in the dark, lighting up the water.’’

Although Frank still retains a certain Swiss civility, he enjoys provocation in others. He refers to the French celebrity photographer Francois-Marie Banier, notorious for insinuating himself into the affections of wealthy older women, as ‘‘the bad-man friend of mine.’’ Onstage at Lincoln Center, when his chosen interviewer, Charlie LeDuff, asked about the state of Frank’s rectum, Frank was amused at the general mortification.

Some days Frank is a steel door; others he is impish, a trickster. Not long after he renounced his Leica, word circulated among other photographers that he was entering photo contests under assumed names and winning. Ask him how he is, and Frank may reply, ‘‘Fifty percent!’’ What does that mean? ‘‘If it goes below 50 percent, my red light goes on!’’ One day, he loves crowds. Another day, crowds are ‘‘impossible.’’ A third pass, and the dark eyes gleam, and there’s nothing like ‘‘a medium-size crowd.’’ His terse style of speaking sometimes produces epigrams: ‘‘It’s the misinformation that’s important.’’

Photo

‘‘Take that seriously,’’ warns Brookman, who has known Frank since the 1970s. ‘‘He loves misleading people.’’ When Frank is feeling affectionate, his puckish banter is seductive to younger artists — especially photographers. Many men have felt for a time like a second son to Frank, only to abruptly find that some sort of personal fission has occurred, the focus of Frank’s guarded eyes has moved on and they’ve been purged. His longtime gallerist Peter MacGill has grown accustomed to offering consolation: ‘‘Robert hurts the people he’s closest to.’’ One photographer, in an anticipatory gambit, stopped talking with Frank for more than two years. When I met MacGill, he warned me, ‘‘Everybody who knows him gets periodically fired.’’

‘‘It’s that you’re not a contestant anymore for something extraordinary,’’ Leaf says. ‘‘We all fall short. It’s the way a man desires a woman. This is the one! He’s always hoping somebody will change the view of the world.’’ The personal quality Frank perhaps values most is autonomy, and when others want too much from him, he gets prickly and feels exploited; it’s time to leave. ‘‘It was always important to him to remain independent of Switzerland, his family, Life magazine, Cartier-Bresson, Evans and go forward, keep pushing,’’ Brookman says.

There have been unbroken bonds. Sarah Greenough, senior curator of photographs at the National Gallery, says Frank and Motomura always ‘‘were devoted, even though Robert didn’t speak Japanese and Motomura didn’t speak English.’’ Another person on whom the door has never closed is Peter Kasovitz, the gregarious owner of K&M Camera in New York. Many in Frank’s community wonder why Kasovitz should be spared. Frank, whose father sold electronics, says Kasovitz is the consummate independent operator: ‘‘He doesn’t go by others’ rules. He just runs things in a way he believes.’’

For decades, Frank refused honors and exhibitions. He once skipped a private celebration for the Museum of Modern Art’s new photography curator because he wanted to test the set of tires he’d just acquired for his Subaru. But lately, he attends his openings; this summer he accepted an honorary degree from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design.

Frank retains the spontaneous enthusiasm of a much younger man. In his tenth decade, he is still a free-form outsider seeking untried situations, fresh leaps — and nothing pleases him more than picking up on the scent of something exceptional. Last year, after receiving intriguing letters postmarked North Carolina from an itinerant laborer named Gustavo, Frank set off to find him. He discovered Gustavo in Winston-Salem painting a house, he says, but ‘‘I was disappointed in him. He was ordinary. He seemed not to be possessed by anything. He just drifts.’’

A more satisfactory result came after an unannounced knock on the door from a California family. The father, Leaf says, ‘‘was a junk collector looking for a masterpiece.’’ Recently he’d purchased three pictures. ‘‘One looked like it was from Woolworth’s, and he thought it was a Boucher. The second was the worst thing you ever saw. He thought it was a de Kooning. The third, somebody tells him it’s a Sanyu. He looks it up and sees Robert knows him.’’ So the family crossed the country by car to show Frank the painting possibly by Sanyu. ‘‘You don’t have to open your eyes to see it’s not a Sanyu painting,’’ Leaf says. ‘‘He doesn’t mind. He’s a speculator! He’s happy!’’ Eventually, Leaf and Frank had to go out. ‘‘What do you want to do?’’ Leaf asked their visitors.

‘‘Nothing,’’ came the answer. ‘‘We came to see you.’’ The family made their hosts tortillas from scratch and drove off for Louisiana to surprise an aunt.

Frank found all of this immensely satisfying. ‘‘I liked his directness. Completely direct. I could tell them about Sanyu. They had no interest in June or in my photographs.’’ And so Frank decided that the father should have his masterpiece after all. ‘‘I sent them two of my photographs. I wonder if they found out what people pay for a print like that.’’",REAL
"Arianna Huffington’s Improbable, Insatiable Content Machine","Within The Huffington Post, and away from the glass table, some staff members have fretted that What’s Working could result in a steady drip of pallid, upbeat stories (e.g., ‘‘How Hugh Jackman’s Coffee Brand Is Changing Lives’’). But it’s hard to argue with Huffington’s intuitions when it comes to generating traffic. Her site has more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to comScore, and it is one of the country’s top online destinations for news.

Nevertheless, in May, Huffington’s tenure as editor in chief was briefly in question. The site’s corporate parent, AOL, was sold to Verizon for $4.4 billion, and Huffington was forced to spend a few weeks negotiating the terms of the site’s future with her new overlords. During that process, AOL revealed that two suitors, earlier in the year, tried to buy The Huffington Post for $1 billion, or roughly four times what Jeff Bezos paid for The Washington Post two years ago. Plainly, to certain investors, digital media companies are valuable because they deliver enormous audiences. Any difficulty turning a profit — The Huffington Post broke even last year on $146 million in revenue, according to someone familiar with the site’s finances — is considered a temporary problem that will eventually be fixed by the sheer size of the readership.

This singular focus on audience development expresses itself in different ways at different publications. At The Huffington Post, it takes the shape of an editorial mandate that, much like the universe itself, is unfathomably broad and constantly expanding. At least in theory, nothing gets past its editors and writers. They cover, in most cases through aggregation, everything from Federal Reserve policy to celebrity antics, from Islamic State atrocities to parenting tips, supplemented with a steady stream of uncategorizable click bait (‘‘Can Cannibalism Fight Brain Disease? Only Sort Of’’).

To work at The Huffington Post is to run a race without a finish line, at a clip that is forever quickening. The pace is stressful for many employees, who describe a newsroom with plenty of turnover. One former staff member I spoke with, who developed an ulcer while working there, called The Huffington Post ‘‘a jury-rigged, discombobulated chaos machine.’’

Huffington may be the Internet’s most improbable media pioneer. This is her first job as an editor or publisher, and few would describe her as a techie. But as one of the first major media properties born in the full light of the digital age, The Huffington Post has always been a skunk works for the sorts of experiments that have come to define the news business in the Internet era.

In its early days, when most visits came through Google searches, the site mastered search-engine optimization (S.E.O.), the art of writing stories based on topics trending on Google and larding headlines with keywords. The site’s annual ‘‘What Time Is the Super Bowl?’’ post has become such a famous example of S.E.O.-driven non-news that other media outlets have written half-disgusted, half-admiring posts dissecting its history.

When most sites were merely guessing about what would resonate with readers, The Huffington Post brought a radical data-driven methodology to its home page, automatically moving popular stories to more prominent spaces and A-B testing its headlines. The site’s editorial director, Danny Shea, demonstrated to me how this works a few months ago, opening an online dashboard and pulling up an article about General Motors. One headline was ‘‘How GM Silenced a Whistleblower.’’ Another read ‘‘How GM Bullied a Whistleblower.’’ The site had automatically shown different headlines to different readers and found that ‘‘Silence’’ was outperforming ‘‘Bully.’’ So ‘‘Silence’’ it would be. It’s this sort of obsessive data analysis that has helped web-headline writing become so viscerally effective.

Above all, from its founding in an era dominated by ‘‘web magazines’’ like Slate, The Huffington Post has demonstrated the value of quantity. Early in its history, the site increased its breadth on the cheap by hiring young writers to quickly summarize stories that had been reported by other publications, marking the birth of industrial aggregation.

Today, The Huffington Post employs an armada of young editors, writers and video producers: 850 in all, many toiling at an exhausting pace. It publishes 13 editions across the globe, including sites in India, Germany and Brazil. Its properties collectively push out about 1,900 posts per day. In 2013, Digiday estimated that BuzzFeed, by contrast, was putting out 373 posts per day, The Times 350 per day and Slate 60 per day. (At the time, The Huffington Post was publishing 1,200 posts per day.) Four more editions are in the works — The Huffington Post China among them — and a franchising model will soon take the brand to small and midsize markets, according to an internal memo Huffington sent in late May.

Throughout its history, the site’s scale has also depended on free labor. One of Huffington’s most important insights early on was that if you provide bloggers with a big enough stage, you don’t have to pay them. This audience-for-content trade has been imitated successfully by outlets like Thought Catalog and Bleacher Report, a sports-news website that Turner Broadcasting bought in 2012 for somewhere between $150 million and $200 million.

As this more-is-better ethos has come to define the industry, shifts in online advertising have begun to favor publications that already attract large audiences. Display advertising — wherein advertisers pay each time an ad is shown to a reader — still dominates the market. But native advertising, designed to match the look and feel of the editorial content it runs alongside, has been on the rise for years. BuzzFeed, the media company started in 2006 by Jonah Peretti, a co-founder of The Huffington Post, was built to rely entirely on native advertising. The Huffington Post offers to make its advertisers custom quizzes, listicles, slide shows, videos, infographics, feature articles and blog posts. Prices start at $130,000 for three pieces of content. This is where size matters; top-tier sites can fetch premium rates because advertisers know their messages could be seen by millions. There have been concerns that readers might be deceived by native ads if they are not properly identified — The Huffington Post always clearly labels its sponsored content — but the ethical debate in the media world is over. Socintel360, a research firm, predicts that spending on native advertising in the United States will more than double in the next four years to $18.4 billion.

Kenneth Lerer, another Huffington Post co-founder, believes that news start-ups today are like cable-television networks in the early ’80s: small, pioneering companies that will be handsomely rewarded for figuring out how to monetize your attention through a new medium. If this is so, the size of The Huffington Post’s audience could one day justify that $1 billion valuation. But at least in cable, the ratings-driven mania of sweeps week comes only four times a year.

Even as she oversees an international news operation, Huffington spends most of her days and nights in a globe-spanning run of lectures, parties, talk shows, conferences and meetings, a never-ending tour that she chronicles in a dizzying Instagram feed. Her stamina is a source of awe to members of what she calls her A-Team — the A is for Arianna — a group of 9 or so Huffington Post staff members who, in addition to their editorial duties, help keep her in perpetual motion. Within the organization, A-Team jobs are known to be all-consuming — but also, for those who last, a ticket to promotion later on. While some stick around for years, many A-Teamers endure only about 12 months before calling it quits or asking to be transferred.

The first time I saw Huffington’s unremitting style up close was in New Haven last year, at the start of a tour to promote her self-help book, ‘‘Thrive.’’ In all of our interviews, she was warm and entertaining. She has a politician’s gift for seeming sincerely interested, having learned that nothing is so disarming as asking personal questions and then listening. She also has a comic’s timing. At a Barnes & Noble onstage chat in Manhattan, shortly before the trip to New Haven, the moderator, Katie Couric, asked her who was to blame for the merciless pace of life in corporate America. Huffington paused for a moment. Then she turned to the audience.

‘‘Men,’’ she deadpanned.

In her talk, she described her own transformation from fast-lane addict to evangelist for reflection, sleep and ‘‘digital detoxing’’ — basically, turning off your smartphone whenever possible. This is a catechism she has branded the ‘‘third metric’’ of success, with money and power being the first two. Her conversion narrative begins on the morning of April 6, 2007, when she collapsed from exhaustion. She fell to the floor in her home office, hitting her face on her desk and breaking her cheekbone. Medical tests found nothing that could explain the episode. Huffington realized that her lifestyle, which at the time was filled with 18-hour workdays, seven days a week, was wrecking her health.

‘‘By any sane definition of success,’’ she told the crowd that day in New Haven, ‘‘if you are lying in your office in a pool of blood, you are not a success.’’

The speech, which I caught a few times, is always a hit. Huffington presents herself as a redemption story, someone who overdosed on her mobile phone and survived to warn others. She looks the part, too: a Dolce & Gabbana-ed woman of a certain age, perfectly at ease, regularly brushing back a forelock of honey-blond hair with her fingers. After the speech in New Haven, people lined up to have their copies of ‘‘Thrive’’ signed. One by one, they offered Huffington variations of, ‘‘You are an inspiration.’’ Some shared their own success stories.

One woman told her: ‘‘In the horse world, I do holistic care, and I’m embarking on a barn that’s cutting-edge. It’s all about positive reinforcement.’’

‘‘We’d love you to write about it!’’ Huffington exclaimed.

Five years ago, in 2010, the site was successful, attracting nearly 25 million unique visitors a month, but it lacked the money Huffington felt it needed to expand. So it seemed fortunate when, later that year, she met Tim Armstrong, chief executive of AOL, at a media conference in New York.

‘‘He asked to meet with me privately, and he said: ‘What do you want to do with The Huffington Post?’ ’’ Huffington recalled. ‘‘And I said, ‘I want to be a global company, I want us to be everywhere in the world.’ ’’

Armstrong offered $315 million, and on Feb. 7, 2011, AOL announced the acquisition. Huffington was made the head of the Huffington Post Media Group, an entity that would control AOL’s empire of content — an odd mixture of offerings including Moviefone, TechCrunch, Engadget, MapQuest, Autoblog, AOL Music and the collection of hundreds of hyperlocal websites called Patch. In a stroke, Huffington found herself overseeing a diverse portfolio with 117 million unique visitors per month in the United States and 270 million around the world. She also managed several thousand editors, writers, bloggers and business staff members.

Initially, Armstrong and Huffington seemed like a natural match. Each is a fan of big ideas that can be executed quickly; each prizes boldness and energy. At one AOL meeting with brand managers, Armstrong ribbed his underlings by recounting how Huffington called him on a Sunday to tell him what was wrong with AOL’s home page. Why had no one else done that?

Integrating a group of such varied websites and personnel would have posed a challenge to any manager. For one who admits to having little interest in organization and planning, it was impossible. Huffington preferred to improvise, and she did so aggressively — ‘‘like a hockey player,’’ as one former AOL executive put it, with some admiration.

A clash of cultures, however, was soon evident. Many of AOL’s sites did little more than promote their sponsors; AOL Real Estate, for instance, was mainly a home for Bank of America ads, next to stories about the joys of mortgage refinancing. In an attempt to restore some semblance of editorial integrity, Huffington fired the freelancers who worked for the site and replaced them with young staff members. Many were recent graduates of Yale — her feeder of choice — whose chief qualification, aside from the obvious, was a willingness to work for a pittance. But the hiring spree was rushed and filled the sites with fledglings. Page views plunged, irking corporate sponsors.

At first, many on Armstrong’s team had been awed by her energy and range, but they quickly grasped that these didn’t always translate into results. ‘‘No one else could give a commencement speech at Smith one day, meet the prime minister of Japan on Tuesday and debate the Middle East on MSNBC on Wednesday,’’ one former executive said. ‘‘But that doesn’t mean she knows the ins and outs of running Moviefone.’’ It didn’t help that AOL stock, following the acquisition, had fallen to less than $12 by August from just above $20 at the time of the purchase half a year earlier. At some point, Huffington stopped going to meetings of AOL executives, and in April 2012, an organizational reshuffling quietly moved every AOL site except The Huffington Post out of Huffington’s portfolio. Her tenure as AOL content czar was over.

By then, Huffington was having a serious case of seller’s remorse. During a tech conference, she was overheard at a bar in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., talking to the venture capitalist Scott Stanford, then a Goldman Sachs banker. Speaking in a voice loud enough for many to hear, she posed questions like, ‘‘Who would buy The Huffington Post?’’ and ‘‘How much would it fetch?’’ Around that time, Huffington Post employees recall, she went on trips with very rich people and returned with news that the site was about to be purchased again, this time for $1 billion.

But The Huffington Post was no longer Huffington’s to sell, and AOL seemed uninterested in parting with it. By October 2012, discontent with Huffington was widespread enough that top executives at AOL were quietly strategizing about ways to ease her into a kind of ceremonial role — one in which she would only promote the site rather than running its day-to-day operations. (A source said the effort was given a one-word shorthand: ‘‘Popemobile.’’ Like the Pope in his bulletproof bubble, Huffington would glide through the world and wave.) The idea never caught on, mostly because it was clear Huffington would never agree to it, and by May of this year, when Verizon announced its acquisition of AOL, it had long been abandoned.

Verizon went after AOL principally for its ad-buying technologies, but in mid-June, Verizon’s C.E.O. and chairman, Lowell McAdam, said he was committed to keeping The Huffington Post, as incidental as its acquisition may have been. Huffington, whose contract with AOL expired earlier in the year, wanted guarantees that Verizon would finance the site’s growth and keep its hands off articles with which it may have a difference of opinion — those on net neutrality, for instance.

Soon after the Verizon-AOL deal was announced, Huffington began to negotiate her future and the future of The Huffington Post. According to two sources, Armstrong suggested closing the acquisition first and prodding Verizon to make promises about The Huffington Post later. Huffington refused, and she held out until mid-June, when Verizon pledged more than $100 million a year for ongoing operations and vowed to give the site editorial autonomy. (Others with knowledge of the talks say that no financial commitments have been made yet.) The money will allow The Huffington Post to broaden its video offerings, supporting a 24-hour online network and what Huffington called, in an internal memo, a ‘‘rapid-response satire unit.’’ Assurances in hand, Huffington signed a new four-year contract that will keep her in situ as editor in chief.

None of this necessarily means that The Huffington Post will remain in Verizon’s permanent portfolio. In fact, if Verizon’s real goal is to offload the site, it has done exactly what it should to burnish the asset for eventual sale. Were suitors to come courting again, they would surely offer less for a Huffington-less Huffington Post.

That is not to say that Huffington is inexpensive to keep around. She flies all around the planet, occasionally with members of the A-Team in tow. A-Team duties include tending to Huffington’s Twitter account, her Instagram feed and her Facebook posts; running her errands; organizing her day; planning her travel; and prepping her speeches, which, if they aren’t pro bono, cost at least $100,000. One former A-Teamer recalled loading The Huffington Post on Huffington’s computer when she showed up at the office.

‘‘Arianna doesn’t surf the web,’’ the former A-Teamer explained. ‘‘She reads stories that people send on her iPhone, and she sends and receives emails on her BlackBerry. But I’ve never seen her on a computer, surfing the web.’’ Huffington said that this is not true, and stated that she ditched her BlackBerry nearly two years ago. But more than a dozen former and current Huffington Post staff members said they had never seen her so much as open a web browser.

Some former employees file this in the category, Things at Odds With Arianna’s Public Image. Also in this category is the vibe at The Huffington Post’s downtown Manhattan office. Despite its nap rooms, meditation rooms and breathing classes, which were introduced as Huffington entered her ‘‘Thrive’’ phase, it is described as a surpassingly difficult place to work.

Much of this difficulty is inherent to life at an Internet news site, where victory means beating the competition by a matter of seconds with a post that might yield gobs of traffic. This is why so many editors and writers at The Huffington Post remain at their desks during lunch and keep an eye on the web at all times. If, while you’re offline, three new Instagram filters are announced and you’re late to post the news, that’s a problem. ‘‘Just about everyone works continuously, whether you’re at the office or not,’’ one former employee said. ‘‘That little green light that says you’re available on Gchat is what matters.’’

Slide Show

Low pay worsens the strain. One former employee said that some staff members take second jobs to cover their expenses. Some tutor; others wait on tables; others babysit. (A representative for The Huffington Post said the company was unaware of any moonlighting.) Many staff members rely on what has been called ‘‘HuffPost lunch’’ — Luna Bars, carrots, hummus, apples, bananas and sometimes string cheese, all served gratis in a kitchen area of the office.

Inevitably, there is burnout. At the New York office, nearly two dozen employees have left since the start of this year, either because they were laid off or found more enticing and less hectic jobs. A Gawker post in early June, written by an anonymous former staff member, said the recent departures were hardly a surprise because the place has long been ‘‘so brutal and toxic it would meet with approval from committed sociopaths.’’

A former editor told me about a period in 2013 when a series of departures left a cluster of empty desks along a wall that Huffington walks past on the way to her office. ‘‘Someone told my manager, ‘Arianna is really stressed out about the number of people leaving, so we need a bunch of people to sit at those desks in the path from the elevator to her office, to make her feel better,’ ’’ the former editor said. ‘‘So we sat there, waiting to say: ‘Hello! Greetings!’ as she walked by. It was supposed to be for two hours, but she got there at about 3 in the afternoon instead of 11 in the morning. It was absurd. I had to interrupt my workday because this woman was stressed out, because so many people had left, because they were stressed out.’’ (A Huffington Post representative denied this story, saying it was ‘‘clearly made up by someone with an ax to grind.’’)

Staff members in Huffington’s inner circle must also contend with her superhuman endurance. Her oft-repeated claim to sleep eight hours a night notwithstanding, she rarely seems to be idle. Emails from her cease, several ex-employees told me, only between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m.

There are staff members who have stuck it out for years and speak highly of the site as a place to work. They say they form lasting bonds with co-workers and relish the sense that they are writing for millions of readers. Some, like Daniel Koh, a former A-Teamer, speak with a reverence and fondness for Huffington herself. Koh described her as a perfectionist of exceptional intellectual wattage, a leader who never raises her voice and never holds a grudge. ‘‘Was it intense, and long hours, and did she teach me to maximize my workday?’’ he said. ‘‘Absolutely.’’

But others who have worked closely with Huffington have found it a bruising experience, saying that she is perpetually on the lookout for signs of disloyalty, to a degree that bespeaks paranoia or, at the very least, pettiness. Employees cycle in and out of her favor, hailed as the site’s savior one moment, ignored the next. (The Gawker post called the office ‘‘essentially Soviet in its functioning.’’) ‘‘Everyone’s stock is shooting up or falling at any given moment, so everyone is rattled with uncertainty and insecurity,’’ one former employee said. ‘‘I’ve never seen anything like it.’’

When I asked Huffington about criticisms of the newsroom, she was unmoved. She pointed to the nap rooms and breathing classes as evidence that she took employee well-being seriously. Only the voices of current employees were worth listening to, she cautioned, because the opinions of people who were laid off or left were likely to skew negative. I noted that she seemed unwilling to accept any responsibility for what a lot of former employees said was a vexing atmosphere.

‘‘I’m definitely a work in progress,’’ she acknowledged. ‘‘I’m not by any means saying I’m perfect. But I feel very good about our culture here, because a lot of our top leaders have embraced it.’’

The Huffington Post is hardly the only web media company with a reputation as an arduous place to work. Nor is Huffington the only editor in chief considered capricious and exasperating by employees. But she is surely the first described in those terms to install hammocks in a newsroom. Only someone with her unique combination of drive and outward placidity could run a tremendously popular, hugely productive website and then begin a second career chastening us for our addiction to the Internet. Somehow she has pulled it off. In her site’s parenting section, some of the most successful posts target moms who are checking their Facebook feeds late at night, apparently yearning to be told that they shouldn’t be on Facebook at that hour. ‘‘You know, posts about, ‘Stop procrastinating and go sleep,’ ‘Disconnect your devices,’ ’’ said Ethan Fedida, the site’s senior social media editor. ‘‘They go crazy for it.’’

It’s as though Huffington is spreading an illness while simultaneously peddling the cure. Call it hypocrisy, but it testifies to her savvy. The business of web media is figuring out what people want — and if what we want is contradictory, why shouldn’t Huffington profit from that contradiction?

Huffington may be engaged in a bit of wishful projection when she presents herself as an apostle of serenity. But it is a veneer she never drops, at least in public. At the Barnes & Noble event for ‘‘Thrive’’ last year, the one moderated by Katie Couric, a young woman rose during the question-and-answer session.

‘‘What do you say to employers who are now seeking people specifically to work in social media?’’ she asked. ‘‘Our job is to be connected 24-7, where we have to manage your Facebook, your Instagram, your Twitter, your Pinterest. How do we detox when we’re told we have to be in the social-media revolution in order to earn our living?’’

After thinking for a moment, Huffington suggested that she tell her employer that tweets can be scheduled in advance, so she doesn’t have to be awake at all hours. Remind your boss that people are paid for their judgment, Huffington added, not their endurance. Couric then asked the young woman, ‘‘You think your boss would be receptive to that?’’

‘‘No,’’ she said, flatly.

All eyes turned back to Huffington. Some bosses are toxic, she offered, so start looking for a new job. With a smile, she added: ‘‘We’re hiring.’’",REAL
What Happens When a State Is Run by Movie Stars?,"Their prayers were fueled by a dual hope: that God would take mercy on Jayalalithaa and that Jayalalithaa would take note of their efforts on her behalf. The best way to get her attention was to put on a performance of their own.

Photo

You know you’ve entered Tamil Nadu when you begin to see Jayalalithaa’s face everywhere: a double-chinned Mona Lisa, her long, dark hair pulled back in a demure chignon. In the cities, her party members line the avenues with giant Jayalalithaa billboards to prove their fealty, and her likeness stares out from posters all over the villages, where her biggest vote bank resides. Her face appears on the outside of the free laptops she distributes to students and then again on the desktops. There are Amma pharmacies for subsidized drugs and Amma canteens for 5-rupee meals; soon there will be Amma cinemas for cheap movies. The ubiquity of that face gives the state the feel of a cartoon dictatorship, much to the annoyance of Tamils indifferent to her charms.

Chennai in particular is a city whose self-image is genteel, cultured and intellectual, and some there are prone to deep embarrassment over the excesses of Amma worship. It is also the capital of the Tamil film industry, the southern counterpart to Hindi-language Bollywood in the north. Its blockbusters are just as bombastic, and its fans are even more fervent: at every new release by the Tamil action star Rajinikanth, his admirers bathe posters of him in milk, a treatment typically reserved for idols in temples. But no actor has dominated Tamil culture like M.G.R., who is like a messianic hybrid of Elvis Presley and Ronald Reagan.

In the movies, M.G.R. was a swashbuckler: fencing with the dastardly, rescuing the innocent, dancing, romancing, laughing madly. Jayalalithaa, born in 1948, grew up in his thrall, but wary of the cinema. Her father died when she was 2, and her mother, Sandhya, was a struggling second-rung actress who rarely came home. At 16, Jayalalithaa was confident and voluptuous, a talented dancer with a knowing air. Sandhya’s colleagues found her alluring and offered her parts in movies. Though Jayalalithaa dreamed of becoming a lawyer, her mother pushed her to turn down a college scholarship and accept. One of her first films was ‘‘One in a Thousand,’’ a starring role opposite M.G.R.

When M.G.R. stepped into the studio, everyone was expected to stand in respect. But on the set of ‘‘One in a Thousand,’’ Jayalalithaa sat cross-legged and kept right on reading her book. M.G.R. was intrigued. Despite their three-decade age difference, she turned out to be his perfect on-screen foil: flirty one moment, haughty the next, worldly and earthy and vivacious. Rolling in the grass in a song sequence from the film ‘‘The Sacred Dwelling,’’ he pounces for a kiss, only to end up with a flower in his mouth; she bites the petals from his lips and flings them aside with her teeth. That they were lovers was an open secret, though M.G.R. was married to a former co-star named Janaki. Over the next eight years Jayalalithaa and M.G.R. starred together in 28 films.

By the time they met, M.G.R. was strongly associated with the Dravidian Progress Federation, or D.M.K. The party grew out of a movement against the brutal social order of the era in which lower­ caste Tamils were denied public resources and often forbidden even to wear shoes or ride bicycles. Dravidian activists protested the dominance of Brahmins in Tamil Nadu and of Hindi-speaking northerners on the national level. Fatefully, the D.M.K. came of age just as the cinema craze took hold in India, and many of its ideologues were screenwriters, M.G.R.’s close friend Karunanidhi among them.

The D.M.K. packaged its propaganda in the form of popular action entertainments, using catchy songs to instill Tamil pride, comedy to mock its enemies and extravagant oratory to attract a following, coding its ideas in allegory to evade the censors of the ruling Congress Party. The D.M.K. made M.G.R. a star: his madcap energy gave their films the wild charisma they needed to carry their message. The party cultivated an image of M.G.R. as ‘‘the savior of the poor,’’ the journalist Sampath Kumar told me. ‘‘And he became intoxicated with that image.’’

M.G.R. became the face of the party, and what a face it was: jowly in a way that was somehow dashing, with a smile that flitted dangerously between mischief and love. It was a stroke of luck, then, when M.R. Radha, a rival actor, unaccountably shot M.G.R. in the neck just before the 1967 elections, and widespread sympathy for his injury helped push the D.M.K. into power. Two years later, M.G.R. used his party clout to propel Karunanidhi to the chief minister’s chair, a prize for having given him his big break in films.",REAL
America’s ‘Postracial’ Fantasy,"The word ‘‘postracial’’ has been around since at least the early 1970s, when an article in this newspaper used it to describe a coalition of Southern government officials who believed that their region had ‘‘entered an era in which race relations are soon to be replaced as a major concern.’’ That didn’t happen. When a 21-year-old white supremacist was charged in the fatal shootings of nine African-­Americans in Charleston, S.C., on June 17, it was a stark reminder that the past half decade has provided little evidence of reckoning or repair. According to a recent Gallup poll, more black Americans in 2015 than in 2014 regard race relations as one of the most pressing problems in the United States. As for the term ‘‘postracial,’’ well, it has mostly disappeared from the conversation, except as sarcastic shorthand.

This is probably how it should be. When people talked about being ‘‘post­racial,’’ they were often really talking about being ‘‘postblack’’ — or, more charitably, ‘‘post-­racist-­against-­blacks.’’ After all, blackness is seen as an opposite to the default — the ideal — of whiteness, and chattel slavery and the legacies it left behind continue to shape American society. Sometimes it seems as if the desire for a ‘‘postracial’’ America is an attempt by white people to liberate themselves from the burden of having to deal with that legacy.

As a child born a few years after Loving v. Virginia — the 1967 Supreme Court case that effectively ended miscegenation laws — to a mixed-­race couple, I was keenly aware of the ways in which many people, especially liberal white people, saw me as an avatar for a colorblind civilization in which the best of white and black America banded together to move beyond this country’s shameful history by birthing beautiful beige-­colored babies. I was subject to a certain inquisitiveness, though well meaning, that I found irritating and doubted was directed at my darker-­skinned brothers and sisters: questions about which parent was black and which was white; incredulity about my hazel eyes; inquiries about whether I consider myself African-­American.

I was a curiosity, and a comfort: a black girl who was just white enough to seem familiar, not foreign, someone who could serve as an emissary or a bridge between blackness and whiteness. It’s true that I can move about the world in ways that many other black people cannot; for one thing, I am rarely racially profiled. My choice, if you can call it that, to identify as black is much different from that of, say, my father or even my own sister, whose skin is at least three shades darker than mine. The eagerness with which people gravitate toward me is not shown to many of the other black people I know. These ex­peri­ences led me to suspect that the breathless ‘‘post­racial’’ commentary that attached itself to our current president had as much to do with the fact that he is ­biracial as with the fact that he is black. His blood relationship to whiteness and its attendant privileges serve as a chaser to the difficult-­to-­swallow prospect that a black man might achieve ownership of the Oval Office.

My interactions with the world also underscored that biracial children are not in any way created equal — others’ interpretations of us are informed by assumptions based on appearance. Few black-white biracial Americans, compared with multiracial Asian-­whites, have the privilege of easily ‘‘passing’’: Our blackness defines us and marks us in a way that mixed-­race parentage in others does not. As the Pew survey explains, children of Native American-­white parents make up over half of the country’s multiracial population and, like Asian-­white children, are usually thought of as white. The survey also reports that although the number of black-white biracial Americans more than doubled from 2000 to 2010, 69 percent of them say that most others see them solely as black; ‘‘for multiracial adults with a black background,’’ Pew notes, ‘‘experiences with discrimination closely mirror those of single-­race blacks.’’

On June 11, the same day that the Pew report was released, another provocative narrative about racial politics emerged: that of Rachel Dolezal, a 37-year-old white woman and N.A.A.C.P. leader in Spokane, Wash., who had been masquerading as black for over a decade. Some commentators dispassionately proposed that Dolezal’s charade was yet another iteration of the white American tradition of co-­opting the black American experience; others, like many of my biracial black-white friends, expressed outrage about her identity theft. Dolezal got to indulge in the myth of the self-made American, of choosing whom she wanted to be. But unlike actual black people, she could discard her putative blackness at any time, which made her performance all the more offensive and absurd. The spectacle of a naturally blond Montana native parading around broadcast and cable news studios insisting that she didn’t identify as white reinforced the fact that for many Americans, blackness is impossible to divorce from ideas of what blackness looks like. (In Dolezal’s case, that meant well-­applied bronzer, braids and a weave.)

Being — or appearing — biracial is a real Rorschach test with regard to how our ideas about race have evolved. For every person who hardly bats an eye at the idea of a light-skinned biracial woman identifying as African-American, there’s another person waiting to inform her that she doesn’t ‘‘look very black’’ (the white husband of a Korean-­American friend) or that she is not actually black at all (an African-­American entrepreneur in a professional women’s association to which I belong). Which is why, when people I meet ask me, ‘‘What are you?’’ my usual response is to look at them with amusement and shoot back, ‘‘What do you think I am?’’",REAL
Joy of a Black Planet,"Photo

In 2011, Zim Ugochukwu was traveling on the Jagriti Yatra, a 15-day train trip through India for aspiring entrepreneurs. Her time in India wound up sparking an idea for a start-up, though perhaps not in the way the trip’s organizers intended. Ugochukwu was struck by the fact that, out of a group of about 500, she was one of just three African-Americans. She thought about how mainstream travel publications, even those online, weren’t speaking to them or their experiences. ‘‘When I searched ‘black travel’ on Google, I saw a black suitcase,’’ she said. ‘‘That’s not what I meant.’’

In September 2013, Ugochukwu created Travel Noire, a resource for black globe-trotters, continuing in a long online tradition of pulling together otherwise diffuse groups of like-minded people: tattoo artists on Pinterest, gamers on Reddit, and so on. In keeping with the times, Travel Noire is more of a brand than a publication, taking on many incarnations: a website, a vivid Instagram account and private forums. ‘‘I wanted to create a place for people to dream about a destination and read about how another person did it,’’ Ugochukwu said.

What she understood was that black travelers had to be able to picture themselves in entirely new territory, beyond the comfort of a cruise or weekend trip to Miami. Ugochukwu tapped into her generation’s most popular mood board (and envy-stoking machine), Instagram, flooding it with images of young, hip, black travelers hiking in Thailand, sky-diving in the United Kingdom and rafting in China, images perfectly crafted to provoke wanderlust. In July, Ugochukwu plans to introduce group packages called Travel Noire Experiences that include locales with black histories, like the Afro-Brazilian communities of Bahia or a tour of black-owned wineries in South Africa.

There is also a more somber, practical purpose to the site. Some Travel Noire readers may also use the site to avoid potentially unfriendly destinations. Much of Travel Noire’s approach, however, involves debunking the notion that certain places might be unwelcoming. Take, for example, Greece, which has a reputation for discrimination and harassment against dark-skinned people. But when one of Ugochukwu’s writers visited the country, she ended up having an amazing time.

‘‘That really changed the narrative,’’ Ugochukwu said, ‘‘just by showcasing it for our audience.’’",REAL
Do Another Woman’s Marriage Vows Bind Me?,"Photo

A single woman, I moved to a new town and became friendly with a married man who then told me that he was romantically interested in me. He said that while he wasn’t in an open marriage, his wife knew how he felt, and they were negotiating some arrangement that might allow him to pursue his feelings if they were shared. I was attracted to him but made it clear that I wouldn’t have an affair in secret and that I had no desire to cause a rift between him and his wife (whom I didn’t know as well but liked). At one point we saw a movie together, and we continued talking at work; we’re adjunct professors at the same university. It quickly became clear that his wife took a far more traditional view of their marriage, and although I thought I was being fairly responsible, I was pilloried by his wife, by her friends and by a close friend of mine for encouraging his attraction. I was told that I had no girl code, that I was antifeminist, that you just don’t do that to other women. Is a woman who has chosen not to marry really responsible for acting as a custodian of another woman’s marriage? My behavior may have been self-serving, thoughtless or any number of things, but I don’t believe it was ethically objectionable, at least not on the grounds that were presented. NAME WITHHELD

Amy Bloom: I don’t think the issue is that this is antifeminist behavior; the issue is that it is self-serving, self-deceiving and thoughtless behavior. I am all for grown women who take the ‘‘sisters before misters’’ approach. Lots of grown women say this — I wish more stuck to it. As soon as she found out that this was not an open marriage, she should have removed herself from the situation, which means you don’t go to the movies and you don’t have little private conversations. There was a mutual attraction, and she knew that she was playing around the edges and it was gratifying and exciting.

Kenji Yoshino: Feminism has nothing to do with this. If a single man were consorting with a married woman, the man wouldn’t be breaking a girl code, but he would be breaking the code of the marriage vow and hurting another person (the married woman’s spouse). The friends’ objection seems to be misplaced in focusing on the gender of the parties. The letter writer actually seizes this when she says, ‘‘I don’t believe that it was ethically objectionable, at least not on the grounds that were presented.’’ So the wrong grounds have been presented — but she is intuiting that there might be an ethical problem on other grounds.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: It’s important to stress that marriage is a social institution. When the people in a conventional Christian wedding service are invited to witness it, they represent the community’s standing there to say, ‘‘We’re going to help you do this difficult thing, which is sustaining a loving lifelong relationship.’’ My own view is that marriage is absolutely not something you can do on your own. You need friends and community to support you, and that’s why gay marriage is an important institution as well as straight marriage.

Of course, there are people who within the framework of marriage have all kinds of arrangements with each other, and I’m not going to say that that can’t be O.K. But this is a case where the job of the people around is to help them do the right thing.

The Economy’s Missing Metrics,"Photo

Nearly every day, a few hundred federal workers, carefully spread around the United States by a rigorous statistical model, carry out a peculiar task on a special, secure tablet computer. Throughout the day, they are directed to visit specific stores in search of specific items — say, organic romaine lettuce hearts; or a 2015 Hyundai Sonata Sport with the premium package; or a men’s long-sleeve button-down shirt, blue, size XL and made of 80 percent cotton and 20 percent polyester. Over the course of the month, 80,000 prices are entered into tablets throughout the country, and the data flow to Washington for processing. Parsed and analyzed by economists, that information determines the official United States government inflation rate: arguably the most influential bit of data in the world, determining whether new factories are built, new employees hired.

Inflation is just one of the many economic statistics that the federal government creates. There’s unemployment, trade in goods and services, personal income, consumer spending, rental vacancy, new home construction and thousands more. These statistics are not objective facts of the world, like the standard boiling point of water or the mass of a stone; instead, their very measurement creates them. Slight shifts in the design of surveys or the assumptions about the answers can lead to quite different results.

Because these assumptions are inherently debatable, the government often winds up publishing multiple versions of metrics. (Inflation has two distinct measures: personal consumption expenditures, known as P.C.E., and the Consumer Price Index, known as C.P.I. Unemployment has six, numbered U1 through U6, to reflect different interpretations of what ‘‘unemployed’’ actually means.) Our federal economic statistics are a remarkable resource: enormous, rigorous, essential. Together, they help us understand how the economy is working and whom it is, and isn’t, working for.

But in the decades to come, as we try to understand whether the American dream is deceased or merely slumbering, our statistics could get so much better. Because they rely on fixed definitions — created decades ago — of the phenomena they’re charged with measuring, they do a poor job of capturing the ways in which people’s economic lives are changing. The statistics are all but useless at measuring the change in general welfare created by new technologies, like Google Search, that make once tiresome tasks far easier to complete (at the cost of adding a whole universe of time-wasting distractions). In measuring employment, the stats are built around a model of full-time, fixed jobs in fixed locations; they struggle to keep track of Uber-like companies that employ people for brief gigs with no central workplace. Entrepreneurship, too, is measured quite crudely: It’s impossible, just looking at the new-firm stats, to distinguish the creation of Facebook from the opening of a small deli in Dubuque. Definitions of occupations are rigid and often archaic. Manufacturing work, for example, is broken down into dozens of discrete subcategories — tool grinders, sewing-machine operators, tire builders, woodworking-machine setters — while all ‘‘software developers’’ and ‘‘web developers’’ are organized into single catchall groups. You could learn a lot about the wages and employment patterns of adhesive-bonding-machine operators (18,210 workers in 2014, median wage $16.28 per hour). But you’d be hard-pressed to find any guidance on whether you’d make more money learning the Ruby on Rails computer-programming framework instead of developing your graphic-design skills.

Most of our economic statistics date to World War II. When Franklin D. Roosevelt first assumed the presidency, he asked his advisers how the economy was doing, and they responded with anecdotes: rail cars running half empty in Chicago, say, or department stores lagging in customers. Other than inflation, which had been measured since 1913, there were no reliable ways to judge economic strength over time. Spurred by F.D.R., the federal government sought to quantify the economy, creating a dozen different offices of economists and statisticians in the Departments of Labor, Commerce and Agriculture; the Federal Reserve; and several other agencies. The politicians wanted simple, straightforward answers to their economic questions. But the economists knew their answers were inherently subjective. They debated what the statistics should measure — arguments that weren’t resolvable with data because the data expressed the values and assumptions used in gathering them.",REAL
Letter of Recommendation: The Oxford English Dictionary,"Photo

Until the appearance of the Oxford English Dictionary in 1928, Samuel Johnson’s 1755 Dictionary of the English Language was the pre-­eminent authority on spelling and usage. Titanic an achievement as it was — Johnson wrote it largely on his own, with the help of a few assistants — it contained only those words the great lexicographer thought worth knowing. Richard Chenevix Trench, dean of Westminster and an early champion of the project that would result in the O.E.D., opposed the very idea of curation, as he explained to the Philological Society in London in November 1857.

‘‘I cannot understand how any writer with the smallest confidence in himself … should consent … to let one self-made dictator, or 40, determine for him what words he should use, and what he should forbear from using,’’ he wrote. For Trench, a dictionary should be a complete ‘‘inventory of the language,’’ not just a greatest-­hits collection. So he persuaded the Philological Society to crowdsource the compilation of what eventually became the Oxford English Dictionary — less a book than a ceaseless endeavor that continues to this day.

Maybe 20 years ago, my husband bought the supersize 20-­volume 1989 edition of the O.E.D. from an old friend, this half-­crazy bond trader. It has been my favorite possession ever since, and by a wide margin, handily beating out all books, paintings and drawings, souvenirs, jewels — shoes, even. To own these books is to dwell alongside your own personal Eighth Wonder of the World, something to wander and delight in as you please. That such a thing should even exist in this chaotic world seems impossible — the painstaking record of not only a language but also value systems and cultures and ways of life, alphabetized and arranged in 20 beautiful volumes bound in midnight-­blue cloth with gilt-­lettered spines, weighing about seven pounds apiece.

Consider Volume V (‘‘Dvandva — Follis’’). The text, typeset in a diverse mixture of fonts, of boldfaces and italics, is surprisingly stately and legible, evoking the sense of well-­ordered complexity that characterizes many of the 19th century’s great undertakings, from the Victoria and Albert Museum to Audubon’s ‘‘Birds of America’’: the truth recorded in every discernible detail, exact and unflinching, crazy, overwhelming. Only a people drunk on discovery, for whom possessing the entirety of knowledge seemed just on the horizon, could be capable of such exquisite arrogance.

Like a fool, I get in the habit of thinking that I have a decent vocabulary — lol! — but there are just nine words defined on the first page of Volume V, and I don’t know eight of them.

A selection of the words added to the O.E.D. in March 2015: ear opening, n.

A dvandva is a compound word made up of two equivalent components, e.g. ‘‘bittersweet’’ or ‘‘prince-­consort’’; it is Sanskrit in origin. Dvornik, Russian-­derived, means ‘‘house-­porter’’ — that is, a person who ferries things around in your house — of limited utility today, perhaps, unless maybe you’re an oligarch.",REAL
A Philosophy of Herbs,"The opposite outlook is held by the globalist optimist who, whether to use what she has, or simply because the devil may care (but she doesn’t), will cheerfully add cilantro instead of parsley to puttanesca sauce, or sage in place of basil to Thai green curry, then puzzle at why the puttanesca tastes nothing like last time, or why the curry brings to mind turkey stuffing.

Seeing herbs clearly demands remembering that their essence is to help. Herbs once were the unique domain of the apothecary and herbalist, the ‘‘root digger and wandering quack,’’ as Hercules cynically appraised Aesculapius. Although herbalists’ mortars and pestles often pounded out false nostrums, herbs do have specific actions on the body, whether animal or human. The deep earthiness of rosemary, the astringency of mint derive from chemical compounds — phenylpropenes and terpenes and sulfides — that plants build as defenses against the threatening bacteria or herbivore.

No matter exactly where its periphery is drawn, the category ‘‘herb’’ contains some of the most beautiful words in the English language. The magical ring of the most familiar has been dampened by common use: Rosemary and lavender, peppermint and cilantro have settled among the humdrum. But chamomile and gentian, hyssop and calendula, holy basil and cupid’s dart and nepitella, lady’s mantle, scarlet pimpernel, angelica, rue, samphire, feverfew and Jerusalem oak — all still tremble with the heavy breath of incantation.

We use herbs; they act. In that, we find answers to all the questions.

To the matter of garnishes: If a sprig of parsley isn’t doing anything on a plate other than waiting to be moved off it, along with the serrated cucumber slice, it isn’t needed. If a sprig of mint will be left sitting pertly in the pudding because it is still on its stem, it isn’t serving.

To the question of how much of an herb to use: As their history as medicine demonstrates, herbs are potent. The exact degree of potency is best ascertained by tasting. If a single leaf of thyme or an edge of curry leaf tastes strong, use sparingly; contrarily, if parsley or cilantro can be comfortably chewed while daydreaming, be liberal. (In general, the rule, as with present-day pharmaceuticals, is discretion.)

To which herb goes with what: The natural affinities tend to be geographical. Herbs that grow in the same climates as the main ingredient with which you’re hoping to pair them will usually cooperate.

If only the devout Sig. Cavaliere had knelt, before lunch, in the terraced garden, he would have seen, with his own eyes, the mint reaching and straining toward the pea tendrils — though I think not even this visual proof would have persuaded such an herbal puritan.

Divided Sky,"“What’s that sound?” I asked.

“Bomb. They are welcoming you.” He smirked, amused by his own joke.

He returned his gaze to the sheep, while sipping his coffee with his thumb and index finger carefully wrapped around the rim of his steaming glass. He is originally from Amman, has been living in Ramtha for the past two years and has become so accustomed to the sounds of war that he knows which are barrel bombs, which are shelling and which are just celebratory gunfire from a nearby wedding.

Unsure how to take his joke, I smiled uncomfortably and got up to follow Ali, a Syrian from Dara’a who does “fixer” type jobs in our building, to have a better look. As I walked with him and some of his friends toward the border, only about a third of a mile away, he raised his hand above his eyes to block the sunlight and muttered, ‘‘la hawla wala kuwwata illa billah’’ — a common Arabic phrase of exasperation that surrenders the will to Allah. A huge gray cloud rose behind the hills, slowly dissipating into the blue sky beyond the serene Jordanian foreground. I could only watch as Ali stared in the direction of his hometown, now engulfed by smoke.

It wasn’t long before videos of Dara’a were posted on Facebook. Ali took out his phone. There were jerky images of ruined buildings and young men and children lying on the ground covered in blood. Noises of wailing and chaos erupted from his phone’s pinhole speaker. With a burning cigarette in hand, he started reading out the names of people, apparently of those who had died or were injured. His thumb kept flickering across the phone screen to refresh the feed. No one recognized any of the names, but we remained silent as he read aloud.

I knew that to the Syrians standing there with me, those images and names were anchored to something real, a town where they grew up, and for some of them, a place where they were married and started their families.

I waited for someone to condemn Assad and his regime or to make a frantic call, but no one said a word. We stood around for a few minutes longer before returning to our plastic chairs to finish our coffee. Some continued watching the smoke rise in the distance. Others scrolled and typed messages on their phones.

As we sat down, we could hear the sheep that had moved on behind us. I looked around and noticed that Ali’s chair was still empty. It wasn’t until the sky fully cleared that he joined us and quietly lighted another cigarette. Maybe after living in Ramtha for the past few years, there wasn’t much left to say.",REAL
Dinesh D’Souza Isn’t the Real Criminal,"Photo

After your conviction for violating campaign-finance law, you served an eight-month sentence, spending nights in a confinement center. Irving Kristol once said that a neoconservative is a liberal who has been ‘‘mugged by reality.’’ So what’s a conservative whose reality is being surrounded by muggers? Unlike white-collar prisons, the confinement center has the full gamut of criminals — armed robbers, rapists, murderers. I thought of myself as an anthropologist with a rare opportunity to, you might say, study the natives.

What did you learn about the natives? I couldn’t find one guy who said that he was framed. They all acknowledged their guilt but argued that they were the small fry. They believe that the real criminals are not only part of the system, they are running the system, and, in fact, that they are the system and that, at its highest level, America is a crime syndicate.

You are a criminal, literally, and you’ve also said that your own prosecution was politically motivated. It sounds as if your worldview was actually quite similar to that of your neighbors. If you put my rap sheet alongside the Clinton rap sheet, I think that would be almost a prima facie case that they have gotten away with far more than I have. My crime consisted of giving away too much money. I didn’t benefit from it in any way.

Many conservatives these days are calling for reforms of the criminal-justice system. Do you think you’ll be joining that fight anytime soon? No, but I have been somewhat shaken in certain assumptions that I used to have about America’s criminal-justice system.

Which belief was shaken the most? That you are innocent until proven guilty. I have no doubt that the majority of people who are in prison are guilty of the crimes that they were accused of. Still, there are also a whole bunch of people who are in prison as a result of plea bargains.

I’ve read that 97 percent of federal cases and 94 percent of state cases end in plea bargains. Before this experience, I would probably have been fairly glib about that.

In California, where you live, ex-convicts are allowed to vote. In many states, they are not. Can we trust you and your bunkmates with the franchise? By and large, the concerns of the inmates are food, sleep, money and sex. I was initially contemptuous of that. I felt that they ignored all kinds of other issues that are important to human life. But it was clarifying, a refreshing contrast with the world I came from. Its relevance to letting these guys vote, I don’t even know.

Do you think that would be a clarifying experience for most wonks? Absolutely.I think we need to bridge the divide between the intellectual talking class and the people who actually respond to politics through raw experience.

In your book ‘‘The Enemy at Home,’’ you suggest that liberal attitudes about divorce and adultery helped to invite the Sept. 11 attacks. Have your own extramarital relationship and divorce changed your opinion in any way? My own marital woes and divorce and ill-fated engagement, all of that, have certainly made me more aware of how difficult it is to make marriages work. But I have not in the slightest departed from my belief in those traditional institutions. Now, my argument was that radical Muslims are able to point to the moral and cultural decay of America as displayed in Hollywood and use it as a recruiting tool. That was true when I wrote it; it’s true now.

In a recent interview, you said that a close reading of Milton’s ‘‘Paradise Lost’’ helped you understand Lucifer’s influence on Saul Alinsky’s organizing methods. Should we expect any more analysis of epic poetry to explain Hillary Clinton? Perhaps Coleridge’s ‘‘Kubla Khan’’ or Shelley’s ‘‘Prometheus Unbound’’? Either that or Dante’s ‘‘Inferno.’’ When I think of a Hillary administration, I’m reminded of the sign on the outer gates of hell: ‘‘Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.’’",REAL

RE: JUDGES

Emily Bazelon explored whether judges should more regularly — and openly — change their minds.

Bazelon’s article states: ‘‘Justice Clarence Thomas has told his law clerks, ‘I ain’t evolving.’ ’’ Apparently, Justice Thomas is proud of the fact that he isn’t evolving. Anyone in the computer industry … nay, anyone in any industry … would be out of a job if s/he were not evolving. Dan Styer, Wakeman, Ohio, posted on nytimes.com

An excellent examination of our country’s judicial history. Our country is still a baby by comparison to others in the world; we’re going to have growing pains and make mistakes. We need to stop crucifying people who admit they made one. A favorite motto of mine is: ‘‘The right thing and the easy thing are rarely the same thing.’’ Tiffany Kennedy, Seattle, posted on nytimes.com

In his dissent in Henslee v. Union Planters Nat. Bank & Trust Co. (1949), Justice Felix Frankfurter mentioned an earlier case in which he came to feel he voted with the wrong side. ‘‘Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late,’’ he wrote. ‘‘Since I now realize that I should have joined the dissenters in the Merchants Nat. Bank of Boston case, I shall not compound error by pushing that decision still farther.’’ The two cases were separated by less than six years. We know that justices err; more is gained by their admitting it publicly from time to time than by pretending that they do not. Robert Feldgarden, McLean, Va., posted on nytimes.com

‘The Word That Is a Prayer’,"One thing you know when you say it:

all over the earth people are saying it with you;

a child blurting it out as the seizures take her,

a woman reciting it on a cot in a hospital.

What if you take a cab through the Tenderloin:

at a street light, a man in a wool cap,

yarn unraveling across his face, knocks at the window;

he says, Please.

By the time you hear what he’s saying,

the light changes, the cab pulls away,

and you don’t go back, though you know

someone just prayed to you the way you pray.

Please: a word so short

it could get lost in the air

as it floats up to God like the feather it is,

knocking and knocking, and finally

falling back to earth as rain,

as pellets of ice, soaking a black branch,

collecting in drains, leaching into the ground,

and you walk in that weather every day.",REAL
How to Sell the Most Cookies,"Photo

Smile. ‘‘No one wants to buy from a person who is frowning,’’ says Katie Francis, 13, who sold 22,200 boxes of Girl Scout cookies this year, breaking the world record she set last year. Look and act like a professional, even if you’re just a child. When making the rounds in Oklahoma City, Francis wears her troop uniform and passes out business cards. Don’t waste time trying to convince naysayers; instead, ‘‘move on and find the yesses.’’ On school days, Francis works past dark, and she logs 12- to 13-hour days on the weekends.

A saleswoman cannot know the heart of consumers at first glance. Whatever it takes, secure their attention first. Francis goes door to door even in snowstorms. When she sets up a booth in heavily trafficked areas — outside a Walmart, say — she sings songs from the movie ‘‘Frozen,’’ with lyrics adapted to praise the virtues of cookies. Once you have potential customers in earshot, your verbal pitch should appeal to multiple motivations simultaneously: their hunger, impulsiveness, pity, inner philanthropist, sweet tooth. ‘‘There is more than one way to sell a cookie,’’ Francis says. Know what you’re selling: Francis can rattle off lists of ingredients and point out which cookies are ­gluten- and nut-free. What Francis refers to as her ‘‘cookie-­selling career’’ has led to multiple job offers and motivational-­speaking gigs. She recently addressed a university’s entire business department and will be the July speaker at Oklahoma’s Professional Sales Association.

Don’t neglect to cultivate your behind-­the-­scenes support crew. Francis’ mother stores up to 10,000 boxes of cookies in her garage at a time during the two-month cookie-­selling season. At night, she helps Francis count money and load inventory into the family’s S.U.V. and drives her to prime selling locations that change with the time of day. (A saleswoman needs to be something like a predator tracking her prey’s movements.) When her mother is not available, Francis has recruited adults willing to shuttle her around.

As for snacking on cookies while on the job, which some girl scouts do, Francis disapproves. ‘‘It’s better,’’ she says, ‘‘not to eat your product.’’",REAL
