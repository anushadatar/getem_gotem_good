The Scallop Sees With Space-Age Eyes — Hundreds of Them,"“For me, Newton and Darwin come together in these eyes,” said Gáspár Jékely, a neuroscientist at the University of Exeter who was not involved in the new study.

Earlier studies had given scientists hints that the scallop eye was weirdly complex. Each has a lens, a pair of retinas, and a mirror-like structure at the back. Scientists suspected that light passed through the lenses and the retinas, which are mostly transparent, bounced off the mirror, and struck the retinas on the return.

But no one knew how the mirror works, or why scallops needed two retinas when other animals need only one.

Benjamin A. Palmer, a postdoctoral researcher at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and his colleagues recently used a powerful new tool known as a cryo-electron microscope to look at scallop eyes.

He and his colleagues froze slices of the eyes, making it possible to inspect the tissue down to its fine molecular details. (Last month, three pioneers of cryo-electron microscopy won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.)

Researchers have long known that the mirror in a scallop eye is made from a molecule called guanine. It’s best known as one of the main ingredients of DNA, but in some animals guanine is packed into crystals that reflect light.

Some fish have a silvery tint to their scales thanks to guanine crystals. Chameleons use guanine crystals to help them change the color of their skin. But no one knew how guanine helped scallops to see.

Using cryo-electron microscopes, Dr. Palmer and his colleagues discovered that scallops make a kind of guanine crystal never seen before in nature: a flat square. “We were amazed,” he said. “We knew this would be something cool.”

The researchers found that the mirrors are made of twenty to thirty layers of guanine, each containing millions of squares that fit together snugly like tiles on a wall.

“To see that square tiling is completely new,” said Daniel I. Speiser, a visual ecologist at the University of South Carolina who was not involved in the study.

Dr. Palmer and his colleagues took X-rays of the scallop eyes to determine that these layers form a flat-bottomed bowl. The scientists created a computer model of the entire eye based on these findings, allowing them to trace the paths that light took as it bounced off the mirror.

Paradoxically, the guanine squares don’t reflect light on their own — they’re transparent. But their arrangement turns them into a collective mirror.

The layers of tiles are separated by thin layers of fluid, and as a ray of light passes through them, it gets bent further and further from its original direction. Eventually the light gets turned completely around, heading back toward the front of the eye.

This arrangement is well suited for underwater vision, the researchers found, because it is better at bouncing back some colors of light than others. “You have a mirror that basically reflects a hundred percent of the blue light it receives,” Dr. Palmer said. “It makes a lot of sense that it reflects all the light it has in its environment.”

The model created by Dr. Palmer and his colleagues may also solve the mystery of the two retinas. The researchers found that each retina receives sharply focused light from different parts of the animal’s field of view.

One retina can create a sharp image of what’s right in front of the eye. The other retina gives a better view of the periphery.

Dr. Palmer speculated that scallops might use each retina to face a different challenge in their lives.

The retina that sees the central field of view might allow scallops to quickly recognize oncoming predators, allowing them to beat a hasty retreat by swimming away.

Scallops may pay attention to their peripheral vision instead when they’re searching for a spot on the sea floor where they can settle down to feed.

Each eye, the new study demonstrates, is exquisitely complex. What’s more, the hundreds of eyes on a scallop all deliver signals to a single cluster of neurons, which may combine that information to create a rich picture of the outside world.

To Dr. Speiser, it all seems like overkill. Why does a fairly ordinary bivalve need Star Wars vision technology? “It’s still a puzzle why they see so well,” he said.

Dr. Palmer said that scallop eyes may provide inspirations for new inventions. There’s certainly precedent: NASA has built X-ray detectors to study black holes that mimic lobster eyes. Perhaps an artificial scallop eye could take pictures in dim seawater.

But Dr. Palmer is more excited by the prospect of creating materials that are new to engineering. His study shows that scallops have evolved a mastery over forming crystals, guiding them into shapes that researchers didn’t think possible.

At this point, no one has any idea yet how they do it. “Understanding that could open the door to much bigger things than just making a single device,” Dr. Palmer said.",REAL
Hundreds of Fossilized Pterosaur Eggs Uncovered in China,"The cache of well-preserved two-inch eggs stunned his colleague Dr. Kellner.

“If you were to tell me a year before that someone would find hundreds of pterosaur eggs at one spot I would have said ‘Yeah, yeah get out of here. Not even in your dreams,’” Dr. Kellner said. “But here we are.”

Pterosaurs laid soft eggs like snakes or lizards, not brittle ones like birds. The fossilized eggs found at the nesting ground look more like deflated balloons than eggs cracked for an omelet.

Dr. Kellner said it was also much more likely that pterosaurs laid their eggs in large nesting colonies near lake and river shores rather than in solitary nests high on cliffsides. He added that the large number of eggs they found suggested the pterosaurs returned to the nesting spot numerous times to lay their eggs.

More Reporting on Paleontology

Using CT-scanning, the team peered into the shells. Of the 215 eggs they found, 16 had embryonic remains, including one with partial wings and a toothless lower jaw. The team also discovered evidence that hatchlings had leg bones that were more developed than their forelimbs, suggesting the babies most likely crawled and were unable to fly. The team added that young pterosaurs were probably very reliant on their parents.

Denis Charles Deeming, a paleontologist from the University of Lincoln in England who wrote an adjoining article in Science about the findings, said he was surprised by the sheer number of eggs that were all collected together in one place. But he cautioned against making conclusions about the early lives and development of pterosaurs from the small number of embryos that the team found.

“They try to paint a picture of how these things worked, but the reality of it is that the evidence isn’t there,” he said.

Dr. Kellner said his team plans to uncover more pterosaur eggs, which may be hiding beneath the ones they already found. They hope to find more preserved embryos that will help unscramble the mystery.",REAL
How a Giant Tortoise Gets Off Its Back,"The giant tortoises of the Galápagos Islands have no natural predators, but their shells represent a mortal danger of their own. When flipped over, the animals — who regularly weigh in at more than 90 pounds — often struggle to find their feet. If they fail, they eventually die.

And for a giant tortoise with one shell type, the saddleback, big spills are a regular part of life.

“The saddlebacks live in places where you have a lot of lava rocks, so they should fall more often,” said Ylenia Chiari, a biologist at the University of South Alabama, comparing them with domed tortoises, another type that lives on flatter terrain.

Although they are closely related, these two giant tortoises have very different shells. Domed tortoises have rounded shells, and saddleback tortoises have flatter shells with flared edges and a raised neck opening.

Dr. Chiari thought the shells on the saddlebacks, with their edges and corners, had evolved to make it easier for these tortoises to get back up, and set out to test her hypothesis in a study that was published Thursday in Scientific Reports. She was wrong, but her research offered additional insights into the anatomies of these endangered creatures and how they may have evolved to get back on their feet.

To test her idea, Dr. Chiari and her team first made digital 3D models of both types of shells using 89 tortoises, some in the wild and some at the California Academy of Sciences.

The researchers also determined centers of mass for the two different types of tortoises by placing them on an unstable platform and photographing them. The scientists were then able to calculate which shell would require a tortoise to expend more energy when rolling off its back.

The results suggested that a tortoise with a saddleback shell would have to work harder to get back on its feet. In general, the study found, the rounder the shell, the easier it is for the animal to right itself — seemingly an advantage for the domed tortoise.

Photo

But there is another significant anatomical difference between the saddleback and domed tortoises: the larger size of the saddleback’s neck opening. This allows the saddleback to extend its longer neck farther, which biologists long assumed was a trait that helped the tortoise reach food in a drier climate.

The shell’s larger front opening also allows the saddleback tortoises to use their long necks to help pick themselves up (they wiggle their feet to shift their balance, too). That hole and the longer necks “could have evolved to overcome the fact that self-righting would have been more difficult in saddlebacks,” Dr. Chiari said, although more research will be required to confirm that idea.",REAL
Shy Elk and Bold Birds Become Partners in the Wilderness,"To study the magpies, he attracted the birds to 20 experimental sites with peanuts on tree stumps. During more than 20 separate trials with different magpies, he judged each bird’s behavior relative to the other magpies in a trial. Like the elk, he measured flight response, social structure and willingness to approach items they hadn’t previously encountered (a bike decorated with a boa and Christmas ornaments). He also noted who landed on a faux-elk that offered dog food rather than ticks (a previous study showed magpies liked dog food as much as ticks).

Photo

Bolder elk and magpies exhibited riskier behaviors like tolerating the experimenter, approaching novel objects and fending off animals. About half of the elk let magpies land, and just over half the magpies landed on the fake elk. And it was the shy elk and bold magpies that were more likely to engage.

This was counterintuitive for an elk: eyeballs offer easy targets for hungry magpies. But magpies also eat winter ticks.

This tick species waits on tall grass for passing animals, like elk and deer, but preferably moose, which don’t notice them until it’s too late. They clump together and infest by the thousands, remaining on a host all winter, expanding to grape size when fully engorged. They can drain all the blood from a moose calf, and are credited with giving the moniker “ghost moose” to those that groom themselves hairless.

Elk have fewer winter ticks than moose, perhaps because they’ve had more time to evolve coping mechanisms, like habitual grooming. But hair loss around the neck is still a problem.

Two decades ago, Bill Samuel, a retired moose biologist and author of a definitive book on moose and winter ticks, found some moose also evade the pests by tolerating magpies. Perhaps, Dr. Found thinks, shy elk gain an advantage over bold elk and compensate for their bashfulness by accepting magpies.

Few studies have examined the role that personality plays in shaping interactions between species, especially mutualistic interactions. In one study, however, aggressive spiders in so-called mutualistic relationships suffered compared to docile spiders. And in another study, bold cleaner fish tended to cheat mutualism by consuming the protective mucus around their client fish and swimming off instead of eating parasites. Dr. Found thinks personality reveals a messier mutualism than once assumed.

But there’s a missing piece to this puzzle, said Alison Bell, who studies personality in fish at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. This could be a three-way relationship: What’s the tick’s role? Does tick personality factor in? And does this behavior extend to all elk and magpies, or is it just some western Canadian quirk?

While more research remains to be completed, Dr. Found’s peculiar observation, described for the first time, demonstrates the complex role personalities play in the animal kingdom. Whether emotional concepts or just behavioral tendencies, personalities exist in all kinds of species and can influence the interactions among and between them. Some combinations work; some don’t. In this case, opposites attract — and it seems to be working.",REAL
Storm Waves With the Power to Heave Massive Boulders Over Cliffs,"Photo

On a flat peninsula in western Ireland bordered by shallow cliffs that rise from the Atlantic Ocean sits a field of boulders. Some weigh nearly four times more than a school bus. Now scientists have figured out how these boulders reached their high perches.

A study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that powerful storm surges swept the boulders inward. The findings might help scientists better understand the dangers of coastal storms, which climate scientists predict are bound to increase in our warming world.

Scientists have long debated whether these mighty boulders were deposited on the Irish coast by violent storm waves or powerful tsunamis.

To settle the question, John Dewey, a retired professor of geology at Oxford University, and Paul Ryan, a retired geologist at the National University of Ireland, dug into historic records, oceanographic data and field measurements. Both lighthouse records and measurements from offshore buoys point toward a landscape that is commonly ravaged by large storm waves.

And some of those waves can reach enormous heights. Take a storm in 1861, which sent waves crashing over an approximately 220-feet-tall lighthouse near the boulder site. The waves broke the glass and flooded the lighthouse. Its keepers, unable to push the door open against the water, had to drill a hole in the door to release the buckets of water before they could assess the damage.

“Think of the power of a wave crashing on the shore that high,” Dr. Dewey says. A single cubic meter of water weighs roughly a metric ton, or about 2,200 pounds, which is roughly the weight of a giraffe. “If you’re throwing a wall of water, say 30 or 40 meters high over a large area, the volume of water is enormous and the crushing force is tremendous,” Dr. Dewey says.",REAL
Tracking the Elusive Whale Shark,"The study is a collaboration of three dozen of the world’s top whale shark experts and thousands of citizen-scientists — mostly snorkeling ecotourists who snap photographs and video as they swim alongside the behemoths.

Giving tourists the opportunity to participate in science is fun and empowering, and deepens their commitment to conservation, said Darcy Bradley, a postdoctoral researcher at University of California Santa Barbara.

“The fact that we can all be citizen scientists is a really important and special thing,” said Dr. Bradley, who was not involved in the paper, but gets regular emailed updates when whale sharks she’s submitted to the database get spotted again. “We need more stewards for the environment.”

The animals that have been spotted are mostly juvenile males, measuring about 12 to 21 feet, although a site in the Galápagos recorded mostly females. It’s not clear where the adults live, though it is presumed that they are in the open ocean, said Dr. Brad Norman, the paper’s first author.

Whale sharks are covered with spots and can be individually identified by the pattern of spots on their sides, just behind the gills, above the pectoral fin, said Dr. Norman, also founder and principal research scientist with Ecocean, a nonprofit based in Western Australia.

A scientist or tourist can take a picture or video of a whale shark — ideally from its left side — then upload the image to www.whaleshark.org. There it is analyzed and compared to the 30,000 other images and either matched or confirmed as a new individual.

“The ability to photo-identify species — and indeed the whale shark was the first shark we could do this for — has transformed our ability to understand how many individuals are out there, who is moving where, how far do they go, and how many are staying around,” said Nicholas Dulvy, a professor of marine biodiversity and conservation at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada, who was not involved in the research.

Whale sharks were declared endangered last year after their numbers apparently dwindled. They are often illegally fished or caught as by-catch along with tuna, Dr. Dove said. Many are also struck by ships. Unlike whales, their bodies sink, so it is hard to know how many are hit, he said, describing the animals as gentle, polka-dotted and slow-moving. “This is a shark that lives in first gear,” he said.

The juvenile males don’t appear to migrate much, Dr. Norman said, with many seen repeatedly in the same region, and not much mixing across the hot spots.

The lack of sightings of fully mature adults means scientists don’t have a good idea of what the animals are doing, where they are living or their mating habits. Whale sharks are unlikely to have specific grounds where they give birth, because of long gestation periods, and the fact that no more than one or two pups have been found in the same place and time, the study said.

Even their numbers are a mystery. Worldwide, estimates of the population range from about 20,000 to about 200,000 whale sharks, Dr. Dulvy said.

In captivity, where scientists see the animals over time, it becomes clear that they have distinctive personalities, Dr. Dove said. “We get to know the bossy one, the shy guy.”

Though less familiar, some of the wild animals have been seen enough to earn nicknames, he said, citing two in Mexico: Rio Lady, and Keyhole, who has a distinctive hole on one fin. “They begin to have stories and narratives and lives that you can follow along with,” he said. “That’s one of the things that adds a layer of fun for the citizen-scientist.”

Dr. Norman, who is in the Maldives studying whale sharks, said there’s nothing like the joy of being near the animals — or watching first timers do it. “You’re swimming with the biggest fish in the sea. Sometimes you’re in water hundreds of meters deep,” he said. As long as a person stays 10 to 15 feet away from the animal’s path and does not try to touch it, swimming alongside the animals should be safe.

“They’re so graceful, they’re so beautiful,” he said. “All fear or trepidation goes and you’re just in awe.”",REAL
Seeking the Source of the Vanishing Great Salt Lake,"“Before we did this analysis people were just saying, ‘Oh the lake goes up; the lake goes down,’ ” Dr. Wurtsbaugh said. But natural variability in water levels and climate change are no longer excuses for inaction, he and his colleagues write.

When the researchers looked at historical data, they saw no trends in water level fluctuations. But development and water diversion since the mid-19th century have consistently reduced water entering the lake. Agriculture — including the use of water for alfalfa, pasture, hay, grain and corn — caused a significant loss.

Reliance on the lake’s waters by a growing population in recent years has been pushing the lake to its tipping point.

“It isn’t the water use 100 years ago that had an effect,” he added. “It’s really the last 15 to 20 years that are relevant to how the lake is now.”

To save bodies of water like Great Salt Lake, reducing consumption will be critical in arid basins, the authors argue. They recommend a careful analysis of how lake water is moving in and out of lake systems to identify distinct sources of declines, as they have with Great Salt Lake. Doing so will help regulators better weigh trade-offs between water use and maintaining lakes at sustainable levels.

These trade-offs have become apparent in previous approaches to preserving saline lakes. The Russian government built a $106 million dike in 2005 that sealed off the Aral Sea, which had been drying up because of agriculture. While this replaced a collapsed fishing industry with a smaller one, the Aral Sea is just 5 percent of the size it once was, and dust storms continue to be a problem.

An existing rail causeway dividing Great Salt Lake could similarly be used to manage lake levels. And continuing to divert water from the Colorado River Basin offers another potential solution, but not without costs.

Water conservation could also help. It worked to save Mono Lake in California. And in Tucson, Ariz., another arid basin, water collection, rock gardens with fewer plants and drip irrigation have significantly cut water use.",REAL
"If No One Owns the Moon, Can Anyone Make Money Up There?","“Before it was something really, really hypothetical,” said Fabio Tronchetti, a law professor at Harbin Institute of Technology in China. “But now there are groups that are really serious. It changes everything.”

Robert D. Richards, Moon Express’s chief executive — whose business plan is “to expand Earth’s economic sphere to the moon and beyond” — is far from the only entrepreneur looking for business opportunities beyond our planet.

Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of SpaceX, boldly proclaims that his company will begin sending colonists to Mars in a decade. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is using part of his fortune to finance his rocket company Blue Origin, and predicts millions of people will be living and working in space.

As these companies go where no businesses have gone before, they raise questions only fuzzily addressed by the Outer Space Treaty: What are private companies allowed to do in space? Can a company mine the moon or an asteroid and then sell what it has pulled out? How are countries to regulate these businesses?

Internationally, countries have been discussing how to answer these questions. In the United States, Congress has begun tackling regulatory issues. Some warn that if the United States does not set up business-friendly policies, then the start-ups could move elsewhere — including such seemingly unlikely places as Luxembourg.

A Quick Fix Before Launch

The Outer Space Treaty — officially it is the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space — declares that “the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all states parties to the treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes.”

The treaty also prohibited nations from making any claim of sovereignty over any part of the rest of the solar system.

Moon Express ran into a bureaucratic wall because the treaty declares that activities of nongovernmental entities — a classification that includes commercial companies — “require authorization and continuing supervision” of the government. (The United States had insisted on the clause, rejecting the Soviet view that space exploration should be limited to governments.)

“We had a mission planned, we had investors invested, but didn’t have a way forward at the end of 2015,” Dr. Richards testified during a Senate committee hearing in May. “There wasn’t anybody that didn’t want to say yes. There was just no mechanism to do so.”

The Federal Aviation Administration licenses rocket launches and re-entry of commercial spacecraft from orbit in order to ensure the safety of people on the ground. The Federal Communications Commission regulates communications satellites, and the Department of Commerce regulates commercial remote sensing satellites.

But the United States does not as yet have a process for authorizing or supervising novel endeavors like a private company landing on the moon.

Moon Express spent about a year working with the F.A.A., the State Department and other agencies to jerry-rig what Dr. Richards called a “temporary patch,” using the F.A.A.’s existing authority to review rocket payloads in order to gain the approval Moon Express was seeking.",REAL
Things Looked Bleak Until These Birds Rapidly Evolved Bigger Beaks,"Photo

Conservationists have been sounding the alarm over invasive species for years, warning of the damage they can cause to habitats and native animals. But in Florida, an invasive snail might be helping an endangered bird species come back from the brink, researchers say.

The population of North American snail kites — birds that use curved beaks and long claws to dine on small apple snails in the Florida Everglades — had been dwindling for years, from 3,500 in 2000 to just 700 in 2007. Things began to look particularly bleak in 2004, when a portion of the Everglades was invaded by a species of larger snail that the birds had historically struggled to eat. Ornithologists assumed the shift would hasten the snail kite’s decline.

But the number of snail kites in the Everglades grew over the decade following the invasion of the larger snails. The reason, according to a study published Monday in Nature Ecology and Evolution, is that the snail kites have rapidly evolved larger beaks and bodies to handle the bulkier snails.

“We were very surprised,” said Robert Fletcher, Jr., an ecologist at the University of Florida and an author of the study. “We often assume these large-bodied animals can’t keep up with changes to the system, like invasions or climate change, because their generation times are too long. And yet we are seeing this incredibly rapid change in beak size of this bird.”

Photo

Dr. Fletcher and his colleagues analyzed 11 years of morphological data they had collected on the birds. Because snail kites can live to the relatively old age of 8, that time period represented fewer than two generations for the birds. Nonetheless, the researchers found that beak and body sizes had grown substantially (about 8 percent on average, and up to 12 percent) in the years since the invasion.

Exactly how the birds are pulling off this evolutionary trick is not clear, but natural selection does appear to play a part. Young snail kites with larger bills were more likely to survive their first year than snail kites with smaller bills, presumably because the large-billed birds were better able to eat the invasive snails.",REAL
Cities That Never Sleep Are Shaped by Sunrise and Sunset,"Photo

Long after the sun has gone down, the electric lights keep blazing. That might suggest that most humans aren’t as influenced by Earth’s light-dark cycle as we used to be.

But a new study, drawing on the cellphone call records of more than a million people, shows that the times of day when they are active grew longer and shorter over the course of the year, waxing and waning with the daylight.

The new study, published on Tuesday in the journal PLOS Computational Biology, looked at city dwellers all living in the same time zone in southern Europe. In previous work with the same data, the researchers estimated how often users called one another.

Eventually, the scientists began to wonder whether there were patterns in the timing of calls.

As it turned out, there were clear peaks and dips in phone calls throughout the day. One peak in outgoing calls was always at midday, while another was in the evening. In one city the group studied, for example, the early peak was centered around noon, while another occurred at 9 p.m. The lowest likelihood of calls going out was at around 4 p.m. and 4 a.m.

Over the course of the year, however, there was a noticeable shift. The last call times crept later during a stretch of three or four months, even as the earliest call times grew earlier. The peak calling periods moved as well, with the morning peak moving earlier and the evening peak moving later. Then, the process reversed direction.",REAL
‘Crazy Jigsaw Puzzles’ Improve Our Views of Coral Reefs,"A century ago, if you wanted to document ocean life, you’d throw on a 60-pound glass helmet, dive in and sketch whatever passed by with a lead pencil on a zinc tablet. Today most scientists studying corals still dive with an hour’s worth of oxygen and a plastic piece of paper, using their personal judgments to jot down all they can before the air runs out.

But over the last few years, technology has catapulted oceanography into a new era of discovery. Now a scientist can carry along a camera in a waterproof box, take thousands of photographs an hour and upload those images to computers too fast to exist a decade ago. Powerful software then stitches together the photos and identifies unique features, creating billions of reference points that help to calculate the location of corals in 3D space.

“It’s like doing one of the most crazy jigsaw puzzles you can ever imagine,” said Stuart Sandin, a coral reef ecologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. He and his colleagues have just analyzed some of the first of these 3D photomosaics in a study published last month in the journal, Coral Reefs.

With the help of computer scientists and engineers at their university, Dr. Sandin and his team created their digital maps using more than 39,000 photos of about 44,000 coral colonies living on reefs at Palmyra Atoll near Hawaii. In analyzing digital reconstructions of about 1,000 square feet each, they discovered for the first time that rather than distributing themselves randomly wherever larvae happened to fall, coral follow somewhat of a pattern. Corals of every species and type, especially those that have similar forms and structures, cluster together across the reef. And some types are more clustered than others.",REAL
Even Whales Have to Exfoliate,"In August 2014, Sarah Fortune was trying to tag bowhead whales with transmitters so she could study their feeding habits in Canada’s Cumberland Sound, where many of the large sea mammals spend their summers.

But the whales kept swimming into a small, shallow bay with large boulders, where at least one removed a transmitter by rubbing against the rocks. “The whales were just rolling onto their sides, lifting their flippers out of the water, doing headstands, lifting their tails out of the water,” she said. The behavior was puzzling.

Though she didn’t know it at the time, the mystery of the rock-rubbing whales dates back at least 170 years. Around 1845, whalers started calling bowheads “rock-nosed whales” after seeing them rub their heads on boulders. Several subsequent papers have also noted the behavior, usually concluding the whales were using the rocks to rest.

But Ms. Fortune noticed that large pieces of skin were peeling off some of the whales. Perhaps, she thought, they were “using these rocks like humans using pumice stones, to get rid of calluses or dead skin.”

Ms. Fortune and a team of researchers published a paper in the journal PLOS One on Wednesday that seems to confirm her suspicions. Overhead footage of the whales taken by drones in 2016 — part of another study tracking the whales’ summer feeding habits — reveals that the animals are using the large rocks to rub dead skin off their bodies.

“Having the drones changed everything,” said Ms. Fortune, a marine ecologist at the University of British Columbia. “We could clearly see these whales clustered around these boulders taking turns sloughing off skins.”

Do Lefties Have an Advantage in Sports? It Depends,"Comparing all six sports against one another, he found the proportion of southpaws increased as the time available for players to act decreased. Nine percent of the top players were left-dominant in the slowest contest, squash, while 30 percent of the best pitchers were lefties in the fastest, baseball. Over all, left-handedness was 2.6 times more likely in the sports with higher time constraints (baseball, cricket and table tennis) than in ones with lower time pressure (badminton, tennis and squash).

His results are couched in a broader “nature” versus “nurture” discussion of why left-dominance may be an asset in sports.

The “nature” hypothesis posits that left-handers may innately be better athletes, perhaps benefiting, for instance, from the fact that the right brain hemisphere is in charge of both their dominant hand and visual-spatial awareness.

The “nurture” explanation suggests that left-handers’ relative rarity gives them a competitive edge because opponents are worse at anticipating their movements or are even used to employing strategies that play directly to lefties’ strengths (hitting balls toward the right in racket sports, for instance).

This “nurture” idea is supported by studies that have found a higher incidence of left-handers in professional interactive sports compared with the general population, but not in non-interactive ones like darts, bowling or golf.

Beyond sports, this explanation could account for why lefties have made up just 10 percent or so of the human population for thousands of years.

“From a Darwinian perspective, there seems to be something wrong with being left-handed,” Dr. Loffing said. “But the question is, why doesn’t it wash out? Why isn’t the world only right-handed?”

In 1996, a team of French researchers proposed that lefties have a fitness advantage in duel-like situations. The same group showed that more violent and warlike traditional societies have a much higher incidence of left-handers than more pacifist societies.

Dr. Loffing believes most of the lefties-in-sports trend can be explained by this so-called fighting hypothesis. His latest research suggests that the benefits portsiders derive from the element of unfamiliarity become greater when their opponents have less time to calculate. “We know that things like anticipation and decision-making are more difficult under time pressure,” he said.

In previous studies, Dr. Loffing and collaborators have shown that athletes can counter or even neutralize the left-sider advantage through training. Next, it would be interesting to combine these two findings and see if there is some time pressure threshold beyond which it would be exceedingly difficult for players to train against the southpaw edge — some threshold “beyond which being rare really pays off,” he said.",REAL
"Fewer People Are Contracting H.I.V., State Says","Photo

For a decade, the fight to reduce the number of people who get the virus that causes AIDS hit an impasse in New York State.

The pendulum is now swinging.

For the second year in a row the number of new diagnoses of H.I.V. infections in men who have sex with men dropped in New York State for 2016, after a decade where the rate of new infections refused to budge. The number of new infections in the overall population fell as well, by an average of nine percent statewide, more than double the rate of decline in past years, according to data released on Friday by the governor’s office.

The decline follows the adoption of new preventive drugs as well as crisis measures instituted by the governor in 2014, when the state infused additional tens of millions dollars into a new, multipronged approach to combating the disease.

Particular bright spots in the data were the strides made among communities historically overrepresented in H.I.V. contraction rates, such as Latinos and, in particular, blacks, who, while representing less than 15 percent of the population nationally, have accounted for nearly half of all new infections, according to a 2015 report from United States Centers for Disease Control.

In New York, there was an 11 percent drop in new diagnoses among Hispanics in 2016, and a seven percent drop in new cases among blacks. The most significant drop was among young people age 20 to 24, where the number of new infections fell 20 percent.",REAL
Philippines Suspends Dengue Shots After Drug Firm’s Warning,"Mr. Duque said that, with an average of 200,000 people infected with dengue every year in the Philippines, vaccination was “essential.”

He said that the Department of Health would be stepping up its monitoring efforts to ensure public safety and that the department’s legal division was studying what to do with the Sanofi contract and how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of children who may have been put at risk.

Mr. Duque said that government officials had been asked to coordinate with community health experts to identify and monitor the children. He said a post-vaccination surveillance program would last for five years.

“I hope that this development will not in any way affect the expanded program of immunization because there are countless number of lives that have been saved,” Mr. Duque said, adding that 7 billion Philippine pesos, or about $140 million, had been budgeted for all government vaccination programs for the year, up from 340 million pesos in 2006.

He would not say when the program was likely to be restarted or what steps would be necessary to allow resumption.

“We need to go back quite a long way to really put the facts together,” Mr. Duque said. “Until that is available, we can’t answer all your questions with definitive responses.”

He said the vaccines that were now in stock would not be allowed to be sold unless the labels were changed to reflect the latest advisory.

Sanofi representatives in Manila were not immediately available to comment on Friday.

The Philippines became the first country in Asia to approve the commercial sale of Dengvaxia, in December 2015. Dengvaxia is the first dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi.

Health advocates in the Philippines first raised the alarm over Dengvaxia when the government announced in April last year that it would be used in the school immunization program despite the fact that it was a relatively new drug with possible unknown effects. But the government continued, budgeting about $70 million for the program.

The government has defended its use of the vaccine, saying that the treatment had undergone extensive studies and stressing that it was approved for use by the World Health Organization. The first hint that there could be something wrong was in April last year, when an 11-year-old boy with congenital heart disease died after receiving a Dengvaxia shot, but the government worked to distance the drug from the death.

Nancy Binay, a legislator in the Philippine Senate, said she was alarmed at the drug’s potential impact on public health and urged the health authorities and Sanofi to “launch a nationwide medical advisory and information drive” to contact parents whose children had been given Dengvaxia.

The recently released Sanofi medical report was “deeply shocking and disturbing,” Senator Binay said.

She said it was “sad” that the health department ignored the warnings about the lack of patient safety and research integrity in the Dengvaxia tests. “Safety should always be the paramount concern when it comes to any immunization program,” she said.

Senator Binay called on the pharmaceutical giant to explain what it meant when it warned of “severe disease.”

“We don’t want the warning to the public to come too little, too late,” she said. “Obviously, there were shortfalls and gaps in the vaccine’s safety profile, and I believe Sanofi is morally and ethically obliged to inform the public what severe diseases came out in their clinical tests.”

Dr. Anthony Leachon, an independent director at PhilHealth, a government medical insurance body, said the Philippine medical community had expressed alarm at the government’s use of the vaccine.

He said that as early as last year medical experts had told the government that there was “lingering uncertainty” about the long-term effects of the vaccine, but that their concerns had apparently been ignored.

“Evidence from manufacturer’s trials shows that there may be a paradoxical increase in the incidence of severe dengue beginning a few years after children are vaccinated, and possibly continuing for the rest of their lives,” Dr. Leachon said.

The clinical trials on the dengue vaccine were designed specifically to assess this “and sadly, this danger has been confirmed,” he said.

“Many parents, teachers and health care workers claim they were never fully informed about the benefits and potential side effects of the vaccine,” Dr. Leachon added.",REAL
5 Takeaways From The Times’s ClimateTECH Conference,"Government to business: You need us

Not everyone bought in to that line of thought. Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic mayor of Chicago, made a very different prediction.

“All the companies that thought the last eight years were too over-regulated, in eight years they’re going to be begging for regulation,” he said. “You cannot create the Wild West on energy.”

Agriculture is ripe for innovation

The future of agriculture might be taking shape in Silicon Valley.

Agriculture, forestry and changes in land use together produce about 21 percent of global emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. With the global population expected to approach 10 billion by 2050, agriculture is a critical part of the climate puzzle.

One proposal came from Uma Valeti, a co-founder of Memphis Meats in San Leandro, Calif., which is racing to develop “clean” meats for humans that are grown from animal cells in a lab. The company hopes to to start selling its product by 2021.

The Farmers Business Network, based in San Carlos, Calif., is helping farmers aggregate data for more efficient agriculture. Nancy E. Pfund, whose venture capital firm DBL Partners is helping to finance the group, said the fund was helping farmers understand when they use too much water, electricity or seeds, “not because they’re doing it wrong, but because they haven’t had that data to understand how to optimize.”

Cities are on the front lines of climate change

Both Mr. Emanuel and Edwin M. Lee, the mayor of San Francisco, said climate change was increasingly a municipal issue.

“As we get these rains that come in torrents, my Embarcadero roadway gets flooded,” Mr. Lee said. “It comes over the piers. It used to never happen like that.”

Mr. Emanuel said his city was experiencing unusual weather extremes. Just a few years ago a blizzard dumped 24 inches of snow in less than 12 hours — while last year Chicago saw its driest winter since record-keeping began.

Mayors of 80 North American cities will meet in Chicago next week, Mr. Emanuel said, to sign “customized, very specific benchmark plans” to help meet former President Barack Obama’s pledge under the Paris agreement to cut domestic emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

"Jerry A. Fodor, Philosopher Who Plumbed the Mind’s Depths, Dies at 82","Known for his buoyant, puckish, at times pugnacious writing style, Dr. Fodor was the author of more than a dozen books, several intended for the general reader. Among the best known of these is “The Modularity of Mind,” published in 1983.

In it, he argued that the human mind, rather than being a unitary system as was often supposed, comprises a set of inborn, compartmentalized, purpose-built subsystems: a faculty for language, another for musical ability, still another for mathematics, and so on. These faculties, Dr. Fodor explained, operate by means of abstract algorithms, much as computers do.

In setting forth this model, Dr. Fodor married developments from the midcentury revolution in linguistics ushered in by Noam Chomsky to the computer science of the English mathematician and cryptanalyst Alan Turing.

While the brain, a physical entity, is amenable to study, the mind — an abstract, elusive quarry — is far less so, and questions about its architecture have occupied philosophers at intervals since classical antiquity.

Plato and Aristotle had much to say on the subject. So, more than two millenniums later, did philosophers like the 17th-century rationalist René Descartes and the 17th-century empiricist John Locke.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Such questions — in particular whether cognitive abilities are innate or must be learned — were taken up again in the first half of the 20th century by behavioral psychologists, notably B. F. Skinner, whose work, by Dr. Fodor’s lights, was a reprehensible thing indeed.

An ardent empiricist, Skinner maintained that a child is born with its mind a blank slate. As it matures, a spate of mental abilities — language, reason, problem-solving and much else — is learned through external experience.

In the late 1950s, Dr. Chomsky, a linguist, philosopher and ardent rationalist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, demonstrated that language was not learned behavior, as Skinner believed. Instead, he showed, it was the product of a dedicated mental faculty that is inborn — in today’s parlance, hard-wired in. His work, scholars now agree, vanquished behaviorism, especially as far as the study of language was concerned.

Dr. Fodor, an equally ardent rationalist who taught at M.I.T. for many years, expanded Dr. Chomsky’s ideas about linguistic innateness to include aspects of mind beyond language.

Drawing on the work of Turing, who developed early mathematical models of computation, Dr. Fodor proposed a model of the mind that entails separate faculties — he called them “modules” — each governing a separate function.

“Faculty psychology,” he wrote, “is impressed by such prima facie differences as between, say, sensation and perception, volition and cognition, learning and remembering, or language and thought.”

As Dr. Lepore pointed out on Wednesday: “It’s a very old idea, but for some reason it got lost in the history of philosophy. And it got resuscitated by Fodor.”

The idea had fallen into disfavor partly as a result of phrenology, the pseudoscience, popular in the 19th century, that sought to divine people’s prowess in given areas — and by extension their characters — by feeling the bumps on their heads to find the prominent spots.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

But if one pared away the bumps and their touchy-feely characterological connotations, Dr. Fodor argued, phrenology’s underlying premise — that the mind consists of discrete, dedicated faculties — was worth revisiting.

One problem that such a model appeared to solve had long bedeviled psychologists: the question of why one part of the mind seemed disinclined to talk to another.

“There are different aspects of the mind — reasoning, language, perception, thought — and they don’t communicate very well, and that’s a bit of a shock,” Dr. Lepore said.

Consider, for example, a familiar optical illusion, in which lines of equal length are flanked by inward- or outward-facing arrowheads:

Photo

Even contemplating it now — though you have known for years that it is an illusion — you cannot help seeing the lines as different in length.

“That’s an example of the perceptual part of the mind not communicating with the reasoning part of the mind,” Dr. Lepore explained.

A model of mental organization in which the faculties are in essence walled off from one another could account for this, Dr. Fodor argued.

“Faculty psychology is getting to be respectable again after centuries of hanging around with phrenologists and other dubious types,” he wrote in “The Modularity of Mind.”

Over time Dr. Fodor revised his position, arguing that some mental functions, including language and perception, are modular, while others, like belief, decision-making and logical inference, operate more broadly. But his words from 1983 still resonate:

“A proposed inventory of psychological faculties,” he wrote, “is tantamount to a theory of the structure of the mind.”

The son of Andrew Fodor, a research bacteriologist, and the former Kay Rubens, a homemaker, Jerome Alan Fodor was born on April 22, 1935, in New York City and reared in Queens.

After graduating from Forest Hills High School, he received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Columbia, where he studied with the philosopher Sidney Morgenbesser. He earned a Ph.D. in the field from Princeton, where he was a disciple of the philosopher and mathematician Hilary Putnam.

Dr. Fodor taught at M.I.T. from 1959 to 1986. He was at the City University of New York Graduate Center from 1986 to 1988 before joining the Rutgers faculty. Throughout his Rutgers years, he maintained his residence on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for its proximity to the opera, an abiding passion.

Dr. Fodor’s first marriage, to Iris Goldstein, an emeritus professor of applied psychology at New York University, ended in divorce. Besides his wife, Janet Dean Fodor, a distinguished professor of linguistics at the CUNY Graduate Center, his survivors include a son, Anthony, from his first marriage; a daughter, Katherine Fodor, from his second marriage; and three grandchildren.

His other books include “The Structure of Language” (1964), with Jerrold J. Katz; “The Language of Thought” (1975); “Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong” (1998); and “The Mind Doesn’t Work That Way” (2000).

Dr. Fodor was a regular contributor to The London Review of Books and The Times Literary Supplement, the London periodical. His laurels include Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships.

Like much in philosophy, a field whose marrow is argument, Dr. Fodor’s work was not without controversy. No book of his engendered more of it than the provocatively titled volume “What Darwin Got Wrong” (2010), written with Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, a University of Arizona cognitive scientist.

In it, the authors took on one of evolutionary biology’s sacred cows: natural selection. They argued that the process, with its slow incremental changes, may have little bearing on the development of cognition, or, for that matter, other features of Homo sapiens.

“We think that what is needed,” they wrote, “is to cut the tree at its roots: to show that Darwin’s theory of natural selection is fatally flawed.”

They continued, in one of the most damning indictments a rationalist can make, “We claim that Skinner’s account of learning and Darwin’s account of evolution are identical in all but name.”

The book loosed an uproar among scientists. (Its review in the magazine Science appeared under the headline “Two Critics Without a Clue.”)

“He and Chomsky had a modus operandi which was ‘Bury your opponents as early as possible,’ ” Dr. Lepore said, speaking of Dr. Fodor. “And when he went up against the scientific community, I don’t think Fodor was ready for that. He basically told these guys that natural selection was bogus. The arguments are interesting, but he didn’t win a lot of converts.”

In the end, despite a half-century of work by Dr. Fodor and his colleagues, the mind remains a slippery thing. He brought the point forcibly home in “The Mind Doesn’t Work That Way.”

“We’ve got lots to do,” Dr. Fodor wrote. “In fact, what our cognitive science has done so far is mostly to throw some light on how much dark there is.”",REAL
"Without Obamacare Mandate, ‘You Open the Floodgates’ for Skimpy Health Plans","While repeal supporters argue that people would benefit by having the choice to buy less expensive plans, state regulators have been cracking down on rogue agents who have misled customers about what such inexpensive plans cover or more important don’t.

Examples abound of people who are dumped from such policies or denied coverage, mired in debt and medical bills totaling thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.

One case pending in federal court involves Kevin Conroy, who had a heart attack in 2014 and underwent triple bypass surgery, just two months after his wife, Linda, obtained a short-term policy over the telephone.

Their insurer, HHC Life, refused to pay the bills.

“We freaked out,” Ms. Conroy said. “What were we going to do? It was $900,000.”

The insurer informed the Conroys the policy was “rescinded,” to use the industry jargon. After poring through his medical records, HCC claimed Mr. Conroy failed to disclose he suffered from alcoholism and degenerative disc disease, conditions he said were never diagnosed. “When one thing didn’t work, they went to another,” Mr. Conroy said.

HCC Life, a unit of Tokio Marine HCC, says it will defend its case. The company is also the subject of a multistate review by insurance regulators to see if it engaged in unfair or deceptive acts. It says it has fully cooperated. HCC Life stopped selling short-term policies last May.

A major player in this area is UnitedHealth Group, which abandoned the Affordable Care Act market after incurring sizable losses. United offers short-term plans through its Golden Rule unit. Before the federal law, Golden Rule was among those insurers criticized for rescinding policies. The company recently told investors it was excited by the president’s executive order because that would mean an increase in business for these plans.

Last year, a short-term policy averaged $109 a month for an individual, according to a recent analysis by eHealth, an online broker, compared with $378 a month during last year’s open enrollment period for an A.C.A. plan.

The policies are particularly attractive to the millions of people who don’t qualify for federal subsidies; only about half of the 17 million people buying coverage are subsidized, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Another target audience would be the 28 million who are uninsured. And some brokers are deliberately promoting the policies without pointing out they do not meet the same levels of coverage of A.C.A. plans, said Scott Flanders, the chief executive of eHealth. “They’re selling the hell out of it,” he said.

Jeff Smedsrud, a founder of Healthcare.com, an online insurance shopping site, “There are companies that aggressively, and some very aggressively, market it as a panacea.”

In recent years, state regulators have investigated the marketing practices of particular brokers, and consumers have sued to expose the actions of some bad actors.

In Pennsylvania during the past two years, the state took action against seven agents for misrepresenting the plans they sold. One woman who had a stroke was left with $250,000 in unpaid medical bills because the policy did not cover prescription drugs and other basic treatment.

While a handful of states, including New Jersey, now effectively ban short-term plans, others review rates and make sure the policies follow state law, said Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University.



But other states will likely do little to prevent more sales of these policies, said Katherine Hempstead, a policy expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “You’re going to make it easier in places where it is already easy,” she said.

Industry experts estimate as many as a million people may now have these policies, though the official tally is much lower. And others may fall under this umbrella, because it’s hard to distinguish from alternatives, like so-called limited benefit plans, which cap how much the insurer will pay, and association plans, available to small businesses, that will also be expanded under Mr. Trump’s executive order.

Several companies are poised to capitalize on a less restrictive environment. Health Insurance Innovations, which markets short-term policies, including those once offered by HCC Life, is under scrutiny by state insurance regulators. It recently told investors that there were “tens of millions” of people who could benefit from these plans. The company declined to comment.

These plans typically offer much higher commissions to brokers selling them, and they can be much more profitable for insurers. UnitedHealth’s Golden Rule spent about half of every dollar it took in premiums for medical expenses, according to regulatory filings. Under the federal law, insurers must spend at least 80 cents of each dollar on care for their customers. UnitedHealth declined to comment.

Some experts speculate that insurers are likely to exploit the existing A.C.A. market as a way of selling short-term policies to people until they have serious medical conditions. Coverage sold under the federal law would become increasingly expensive, with people priced out of the market if they didn’t get subsidies, Mr. Laszewski, the industry consultant, said.

While the market for subsidized coverage is largely protected, the market for those who pay the full cost is already shrinking, he said.

Like the insurance that was sold before the federal health care law, people with chronic conditions or a history of illness are mostly turned away. Companies will sometimes rescind policies if an individual has high medical bills.

UnitedHealth’s Golden Rule recently won a lawsuit involving one of its short-term policies, claiming it did not have to cover $400,000 in medical bills because it said a woman with breast cancer had an abnormal mammogram before she enrolled. The case is being appealed.



“Insurance companies today are interpreting their short-term health insurance policies so as to label any condition that arises during the policy term as a pre-existing condition for which the company can exclude coverage,” said a lawyer representing Ms. Jones in a statement. UnitedHealth declined to comment.

Customers often have had to argue about whether something was a pre-existing condition. When Karen Campbell and her husband looked for insurance before Obamacare, “we had this extensive, unbelievable interview, each of us about our medical history,” she said. After rupturing her Achilles’ tendon, which required $30,000 in surgery and physical therapy, the insurer asked for medical records to make sure it wasn’t something she previously had. “They just made it really difficult,” Ms. Campbell said.

Grace Wood, an instructor at a university in San Francisco, bought a short-term plan in 2013. When she had to have a heart procedure, her insurer, HCC Life, balked, leaving her with roughly $150,000 in unpaid medical bills.

“Why should I go bankrupt?” Ms. Wood recalled asking herself. It took her a year and a half, but she appealed and turned to regulators when the insurer ignored her. HCC eventually paid the claims.",REAL
Energy Idea for Mars Yields a Clue for Powering Data Centers,"On the Mars project, he focused on using electricity to fuel chemical reactions among elements found on the Red Planet, even creating dirt capable of germinating a seed. Figuring that he should be able to reverse the process, he founded Bloom and worked on converting chemical energy to electricity using readily available fuels and conductors.

Eventually, he and his team hit upon a version of the current design of roughly 5-inch-square fuel cells fused together in stacks — each about the size of a half-loaf of bread and capable of powering an average home. The stacks are loaded into tubular metal casings before being enclosed in banks about the size of a refrigerator that can then be arrayed on the ground or a roof to run large facilities.

The equipment, produced at the company headquarters here with final assembly at a factory in Delaware, is simultaneously high- and low-tech. Each cell is made from a thin ceramic wafer that is mainly zirconia — a relative of the diamond substitute. In a process reminiscent of high school art class, the wafers are screen printed with chemical inks on each side in an automated sequence and then fired in kilns. They are sandwiched between metal plates, and the resulting structure is a solid oxide fuel cell that can operate at very high temperatures, about 800 degrees Celsius, or 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit.

At that temperature, when natural gas mixed with steam flows over one surface of the cell while oxygen flows over the other, a reaction results in the release of electricity, steam that is recycled through the process and carbon dioxide.

Equinix tested the Bloom cells at a data center in San Jose for 18 months before committing to the current arrangement, in which it will buy the energy under a 15-year power purchase agreement. The company, which runs more than 185 data centers on five continents, serves as a kind of cloud and network broker. It builds and operates facilities that provide space, power and cooling as well as work rooms, showers and a security system featuring a series of locked chambers like something out of “Get Smart.” The client companies bring their own servers and other hardware to plug into more than 1,000 networks that connect them to customers and to each other.

The Southern Company, based in Atlanta, comes into the partnership because it has unregulated businesses that sell power nationwide. In this case, Southern buys the fuel-cell generators from Bloom and then, through a subsidiary called PowerSecure, sells the output to Equinix under a 15-year agreement.

The Bloom deal with Equinix and Southern is among the largest ever for a fuel-cell business, but Bloom faces competition from other providers, like Fuel Cell Energy, which is based in Danbury, Conn., and has a partnership with Exxon Mobil. It has won a number of recent contracts, which include installing and operating three fuel-cell projects for the Long Island Power Authority and one that will supply power for the Navy submarine base in Groton, Conn.

Indeed, the United States government has had a hand in the technology’s development through grant programs at the Energy Department and a federal tax credit that expired at the end of last year.

The natural-gas fuel cells provide some environmental advantages over traditional power plants that run on fossil fuels: They use little water and release almost no harmful smog emissions. The Bloom cells can also run on biogas or hydrogen, which would make them even more environmentally friendly, given a steady supply of those fuels.

The usefulness of natural-gas fuel cells in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a matter of some debate, however. Some environmentalists and public-utility officials say the fuel cells’ emissions may be understated and question whether their carbon reductions are sufficient to warrant public subsidies.

Photo

Still, their emissions are well below the average for coal-fired plants. Bloom puts the emissions of its natural-gas cells in the range of 679 to 833 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour, while coal plants released 2,252 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour in the second quarter of this year, according to the Power Sector Carbon Index, an analysis published by the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. They are much closer to those of natural-gas plants, which, according to the index, averaged 938 pounds per megawatt-hour during the same period.

Though companies looking to power energy-hungry data centers have often sought out hydroelectric power, which does not depend on fossil fuels and is generally inexpensive, fuel-cell technology is gaining traction, especially for customers who need an extremely steady power supply even during storms. For Tom Fanning, chief executive of Southern Company, the partnership with Bloom is part of a bid to take advantage of the technological advances that are upending the electric industry by allowing customers to make their own power, known as distributed generation.

"Score One for Corn: In Battle Over Biofuel, a Rare Setback for Big Oil","Such arguments appear to have been no match, however, for the sway held by corn farmers over President Trump, who promised Iowa farmers during the presidential primaries that he would retain the mandate. The Midwestern agricultural belt is an important part of his base.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, enacted in 2005 and significantly expanded two years later, requires that refiners blend an increasing amount of biofuel into gasoline nationwide. The program grew out of an effort by lawmakers to reduce the country’s reliance on oil, prop up its struggling corn and soy farmers and, in theory, rein in rising greenhouse gas emissions.

The mandate became a headache for some refiners, who struggled under a rule that forced them to buy credits to prove they had blended the ethanol and gasoline. So when Mr. Trump appointed the billionaire Carl C. Icahn, a majority investor in a Texas oil refiner, as special adviser on regulatory matters, expectations rose for a rule change.

Mr. Icahn quickly got to work behind the scenes, pressing the issue with Scott Pruitt, who would become administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as with Mr. Trump. The E.P.A. soon issued a request for public comment on possible changes to the mandate, including a reduction in biofuel quotas.

(Mr. Icahn later stepped down from his post after scrutiny from members of Congress about whether he was influencing regulations on ethanol to benefit his financial investments. He has now been subpoenaed by the Department of Justice over his efforts to overhaul the program.)

Those moves incensed the biofuels industry and their allies in Congress. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, accused the Trump administration of a “bait and switch” scheme. In October, 38 senators urged Mr. Pruitt to back off from any changes. Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa called the president to plead her case.

“We commend the E.P.A. for laying to rest a year of attempts from a small group of oil refiners who have been using every trick in the book to change the established rules,” Emily Skor, chief executive of the ethanol industry group Growth Energy, said in a statement. “We are grateful to our allies in Congress and to Administrator Pruitt for working with us.”

Some recent research has shown that the predicted environmental benefits of biofuels are elusive, partly because a class of more advanced biofuels has not grown as expected.

Instead, most growth has been in corn ethanol and soy biodiesel, which has driven cultivation of both crops to record highs. Almost 40 percent of domestic corn, and almost 30 percent of domestic soy, now goes toward ethanol, according to Department of Agriculture data. Biofuels currently make up close to 10 percent of the gasoline used in the United States.

But that expansion has pushed crop production into grasslands and other previously uncultivated land, hurting biodiversity and reducing the land’s ability to store carbon, scientists warn. Bioenergy can also increase competition for land with food crops and livestock grazing.

A 2015 study by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that between 2008 and 2012, more than 7 million acres of grassland and other uncultivated areas in the United States were converted to crop production, an area larger than the state of Massachusetts.

Moreover, some scientists have cast doubt on the very assumption underpinning the use of biofuels: that they do not raise levels of earth-warming gases in the atmosphere because the carbon dioxide the plants absorb when they grow offsets the carbon dioxide that is released when plant fuels are burned. A 2010 E.P.A. assessment of the program’s impacts estimated that the program would achieve 138 million metric tons in greenhouse gas emissions reductions by 2022.

A study published last year by researchers at the University of Michigan Energy Institute concluded that to date, biofuels had increased, rather than decreased, the country’s carbon dioxide emissions. The biofuels industry has disputed the study.

“The promise of better environmental benefits has completely failed,” said John M. DeCicco, a research professor at the institute who led the study and a former fellow at the Environmental Defense Fund. “There’s no doubt in my mind that the expansion we’ve seen so far has increased our greenhouse gas emissions.”

These fears differ from the oil industry’s complaints. Still, some environmental groups that had hoped that fossil fuel interests would have enough clout to convince the Trump administration to overhaul the mandate.

Instead, environmentalists are facing yet another defeat under Mr. Trump.

Australia Powers Up the World’s Biggest Battery — Courtesy of Elon Musk,"Mr. Weatherill, a Labor Party politician who has tried to promote his state as a magnet for innovation since taking office in 2011, was at home on his sofa in March when his phone began lighting up.

He was just days away from announcing a plan to deal with the power failures that had plagued his state for years.

On his phone came Twitter notification after Twitter notification with news that would upend his plan: Mr. Musk had offered to build the most powerful battery ever made, and do it faster than ever imagined.

Recalling that moment, Mr. Weatherill said he started to sweat. If he embraced Mr. Musk’s proposal, would it look like a billionaire American entrepreneur was strong-arming his state into redefining its energy policy? Was Mr. Musk’s offer real, or merely a publicity stunt?

When Mr. Musk was asked by the Australian entrepreneur (and fellow billionaire) Mike Cannon-Brookes “how serious” he was about his offer, the American mogul doubled down.

“Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free,” Mr. Musk tweeted. “That serious enough for you?”

“Of course, the whole thing then exploded, and everyone’s piling on me, saying ‘Grab it!’” Mr. Weatherill said at a conference in Adelaide, the state’s capital, in September.

For Mr. Weatherill, the project has been a repudiation of a federal policy that de-emphasizes renewable energy. For Mr. Musk, the battery has been a headline-grabbing venture that could prove that his radical vision of the world’s energy future is both functional and economical.

“This fits into his M.O. of doing these big, grandstanding things to get attention for the company and the technology that he’s building,” said Ashlee Vance, the author of a 2015 biography of Mr. Musk. “Tesla’s at this really critical stage where they’re trying to be both a car company and an energy company at the same time.”

Australia is a fitting target for Mr. Musk. The country is the world’s largest exporter of coal. By most measures, it is the sunniest continent on earth. It has abundant wind and hydroelectric power capabilities. And yet the cost of electricity in Australia increased 20 percent from 2012 to 2016, and Australians this year paid between 50 and 100 percent more for their power than Americans, according to experts.

South Australia has the highest electricity prices in the world. This imbalance of supply and demand has resulted in regular blackouts and astronomical bills for the state’s 1.7 million residents.

The high-capacity Tesla battery does not create energy, it just stores it. The state already invests in wind and solar energy. The battery would give it a bank of saved energy, which could ease pressure during periods of high demand and help better manage the electrical grid.

“More than 40 percent of South Australia’s electricity is coming from wind, which is good,” said Tony Wood, an energy director at the Grattan Institute, a think tank. “But the consideration of how to integrate it — and manage that intermittency — wasn’t so good.”

The day after Mr. Weatherill was roused from his couch in March, he and Mr. Musk spoke on the phone about the proposal. The Australian, knowing the tech mogul’s ability to stir the news media, had one demand: If Tesla were to win the contract, Mr. Musk would appear in South Australia to announce it to the world.

“He usually doesn’t come for announcements of winning a tender,” Mr. Weatherill said, “but he said he’d come.”

Mr. Musk nearly broke his promise, after a rocket launch by his company SpaceX was delayed. But in September, Mr. Musk arrived in Adelaide to announce the $50 million deal and to start the 100-day countdown to the project’s completion.

“What this serves as is a great example to the rest of the world of what can be done,” Mr. Musk said at the time, adding that half the battery had already been finished.

Mr. Musk declined to be interviewed for this article.

In March, when Mr. Musk first presented his proposal, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spoke with the entrepreneur and tweeted enthusiastically about its potential.

Months later, when Tesla and the French renewables company Neoen were awarded the contract, however, Mr. Turnbull’s Liberal Party government assailed the battery project and continued its attack on South Australia’s energy policy.

“30,000 South Australian households could not get through watching one episode of ‘Australia’s Ninja Warrior’ with this big battery,” said Scott Morrison, the country’s treasurer.

Mr. Turnbull’s government has promoted fossil fuels over renewable energy to stimulate growth and prevent South Australia’s power shortages. The government has questioned the battery’s capacity, implied the state has been hoodwinked by a clever salesman and suggested that Mr. Weatherill was looking for publicity ahead of a 2018 election.

“The Tesla battery has been sold to the people of South Australia as an answer to their woes,” Josh Frydenberg, the energy minister, wrote in an email. “But in reality it is just a fraction of the storage and backup that South Australia needs.”

Franck Woitiez, the general manager of Neoen’s Australia division, which will operate the battery from its wind farm, said the Turnbull government was out of touch with the future of renewable energy.

“There’s no turning back,” said Mr. Woitiez. “It’s not tomorrow, it’s now.”

The next several weeks, the beginning of Australia’s summer, will be crucial for judging the battery’s success.

“Summer is when Australia gets its peak demand,” said Mr. Wood, the energy researcher. “It will be a very important and high-profile demonstration in the role that batteries can play.”

But some experts said the stakes would be even higher for Mr. Musk. He could shop the idea globally — if it works.

“He needs these battery packs to really become effective,” said Mr. Vance, Musk’s biographer. “He needs this to justify the entire reason of Tesla’s existence.”",REAL

Now comes the tough part: figuring out what that means in practical terms.

Many states and cities have pledged to reduce emissions in an effort to meet the Paris agreement goals. The America’s Pledge movement is notable. It’s also incomplete. What will it take to get the biggest fossil-fuel dependent states on board?

Beyond that, the world also needs an “energy miracle,” as the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates has asserted. That’s where some of the world’s top innovators and entrepreneurs come in.

Astro Teller, the “Captain of Moonshots” at X, the research and development arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, will talk with Mr. Friedman about the challenges and opportunities of seeking big technology solutions to big problems. Katie Benner, a Times technology reporter, will talk to Geisha J. Williams, the president and chief executive of PG&E Corp., about the utility’s ambitious goal of generating half its power from renewable energy by 2030.

I’ll be sitting down with Michael Shellenberger, founder of Environmental Progress, and Simon Irish, chief executive of Terrestrial Energy, to talk about the role of nuclear energy. And Keith Bradsher, The Times’s Shanghai bureau chief, will take the conversation global in a talk with Li Junfeng, a central architect of China’s renewable energy policy.

Governor Brown is likely to remind the crowd that addressing climate change won’t be easy.

“Decarbonizing the economy is like climbing Mount Everest,” he told me in Bonn. “It’s like going from pagan Rome to Christian Europe, and we don’t have 700 years to do it. It’s a transformation.”",REAL
Clearing the Air on Climate Education: A Reporter Returns to the Scene of Her Story,"Others, though, excoriated the students, labeling them “stupid,” among other things. “Folks,” wrote one horrified reader, pushing back after a string of such comments on The Times’s Facebook page, “you’re talking about minors.”

Some readers, especially in southeastern Ohio itself, had objected to the way I’d chosen to weave in information about the region’s socioeconomic troubles, such as the opioid epidemic and the high poverty rate. “What was gained by mentioning a child has to borrow lunch money?” one tweeted. “What did that add to the article?”

I had responded to some of these threads on social media last spring, but the prospect of doing so face to face was more unnerving. And who was to say that this was a conversation anyone in the area wanted to have?

But it seemed I would not get out of it so easily.

This fall, students in the education school at Ohio University in Athens, about 30 miles from Wellston, had been assigned by their professor, Sami Kahn, to read my article. And Dr. Kahn had invited James Sutter, the teacher I profiled, to speak at an event that was soon expanded to include me and some of the Wellston students I interviewed.

The visit, as anticipated, had its tense moments.

In a deep-red region, Athens is a liberal college town, and some community members took issue with what they saw as my kid-glove approach to climate skepticism among young Republicans (even those not yet of voting age).

“Write about how they’re being lied to,” one social science professor instructed me at the reception. “That’s what changes the minds of my students.”

“We’re past debating climate change,” an environmental activist insisted.

The Wellston students spoke openly of feeling betrayed by my mention of drugs, poverty and low enrollment in four-year colleges in an article I had told them would be about climate education.

“In our town, we are just kind of trying to survive,” said Katey King, now a freshman at the university. “We have a lot of pride.”

For my part, I was glad we were discussing the often-ignored connection between attitudes toward climate change and economic inequality. And even as I defended my effort to explain to readers why climate change might not be a priority in Wellston, I knew I would be more mindful in the future of how certain facts might be misinterpreted as judgment.

Tense moments aside, much of our conversation focused on Mr. Sutter’s remarkable teaching. Like many of the students I met in Wellston, those on the panel had, in his classroom, come to consider climate change a serious problem, and to recognize human activities as its primary driver.

There may be emotional safety in talking about your story at a physical remove from where it unfolded. But it is far more enlightening — and personally rewarding — to be there.

A few days after I had returned from Athens, I received a direct message on Twitter from Jonathan Caldwell, a senior at Ohio University in St. Clairsville. “I appreciate your work,” he wrote. His education professor, Jacqueline Yahn, had apparently also distributed my article, which he had used for a class presentation on “how we approach ideas like climate change (or any other topic that can be seen as controversial) and what responsibilities I believe we have as teachers.”

At first I thought Mr. Caldwell, who grew up in eastern Ohio and is hoping to be the first in his family to graduate from college, was simply writing to make the connection.

Then, a few days later, came the invitation: “We’re a small campus here at Eastern. But we’re really close here at the campus and I know we would love to learn from you & I think we could share a lot with you as well.”

I haven’t discussed it with my editor yet. But maybe sometime soon I’ll be heading back once again to Ohio.

How Should We Respond to Sexual Harassment?,"Slippery slopes and consequences

Until recently, all of those accused, no matter the severity of their offenses, faced the same consequences: generally none. Protected by their power and authority, they kept their careers and reputations intact.

As that begins to change, some worry that we might bungle the job. “Taking harassment seriously also requires making serious distinctions,” Jonah Goldberg, a conservative columnist, wrote recently for The Los Angeles Times. “And yet Franken’s name is routinely listed alongside Moore’s and Weinstein’s.”

Masha Gessen, writing in The New Yorker, worried we may be on the verge of a “sex panic.”

Jane Curtin, a comedian who is a friend and former colleague of Mr. Franken’s, compared the current atmosphere to McCarthyism. “It’s just like the red menace,” she said in an interview with The Times. “You don’t know who’s going to be next.”

Many of those accused have lost their jobs, but for the most part, they are not facing legal consequences. Yet principles borrowed from criminal law can help us analyze whether our response to their actions is just and fair.

Criminal punishment tends to rest on two broad principles: the seriousness of the wrongdoing, and the perpetrator’s intent in committing the crime.

Viewed through that lens, the accusations against Mr. Weinstein, which include rape, and Mr. Moore, who is accused of molesting teenage girls, are clearer-cut cases for punishment than those against, say, Louis C.K., who masturbated in front of adult women but did not touch them.

It’s also important that courts do not consider only the moment of the crime itself in determining punishment. Our system also punishes defendants who threaten witnesses or obstruct justice, as well as others who help them do so. Here again, the accusations against Mr. Weinstein are especially extreme. According to a report by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker, he hired ex-Israeli intelligence agents to intimidate victims and journalists into silence.

Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov, two of the women who have accused Louis C.K. of misconduct, have said they stayed silent for years in part because of pressure from Dave Becky, Louis C.K.’s manager. Mr. Becky has denied threatening them. But the women have said they feared that speaking would bring retribution.

Accountability for harm

The question of punishment is merely one factor in considering these cases. The wave of accusations has also led to demands that society recognize and repair the harm of sexual misconduct.

Caroline Framke, a culture critic for Vox, called for an accounting of the “graveyard of potential cut short by careless cruelty.”

The principles of civil law, which are intended to make victims whole and ensure that no one profits from wrongdoing, can offer useful guidance about what is fair, and what is necessary.

A central principle is that the person at fault, not the victim, should bear the cost of the harms of wrongdoing. In law school, budding attorneys learn the “eggshell plaintiff” rule, which says that defendants are responsible for all of the harm they cause, even if the injuries were made more extreme because, say, the victim’s skull was as thin as an eggshell. Otherwise, the reasoning goes, the costs will fall on the victims — a more unfair outcome than holding perpetrators responsible for unexpectedly severe damages.

It is now becoming clear that there is not a one-to-one correlation between the objective egregiousness of sexual misconduct and the damage it can cause.

Louis C.K.’s actions may have been less extreme than Mr. Weinstein’s. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov have said they felt they could no longer work on projects involving him or his manager — a category that grew to include a large chunk of the comedy industry as Louis C.K.’s career took off.

And the Emmy-award-winning writer Kater Gordon told The Information that when Matthew Weiner, her boss on the show “Mad Men,” told her that he “deserved to see her naked,” he undermined her confidence and ambition. (Mr. Weiner has said that he does not remember making that comment, and would not speak that way to a colleague.)

Held up next to the allegations against Mr. Weinstein or Mr. Moore, those words may seem like a misdemeanor. But the harm was nevertheless severe, Ms. Gordon says, because she left the television industry, abandoning a promising career.

Women are often told to grow a “thicker skin” and become less sensitive to harassment. But the eggshell plaintiff rule suggests a different conclusion: that the harassers should bear the costs of the harm they impose, even on “thin-skinned” victims.

We must also consider harms that go beyond the immediate victims. Less diverse workplaces offer women fewer opportunities to find mentorship and achieve success; research suggests such workplaces are also less profitable.

Holding particular harassers responsible for harms suffered by an entire industry or gender is difficult; there are too many contributing factors for it to be easy to apportion blame. Collective harm may be more suited to government- or society-level responses. But again, the harm is there. The question is who ought to bear the cost.

Why it’s hard to think through these accusations

As more men are tarred as bad actors, and once-cherished public figures become pariahs, imposing responsibility can feel uncomfortable, even alarming.

People worry that we are sliding down a slippery slope to neo-puritanism, or in the throes of a witch hunt for sexual impropriety. Perhaps it will turn out that we are. But social science research suggests that this discomfort is a natural consequence of shifting social norms, not necessarily a sign that the changes are going too far.

Humans are wired to conform to group judgments. Dan Kahan, a professor at Yale Law School, argued in an influential paper that we rely more on our peers’ opinions than on actual laws to determine what behavior is right or wrong.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

In the famous “conformity study” by the researcher Solomon Asch, a majority of participants chose to select a clearly incorrect answer to a question rather than defy the group and cease being a peer in good standing.

Partisanship was a crucial element in the issue of sexual assault during the 2016 presidential campaign, when Donald J. Trump was heard on tape boasting about grabbing women’s genitals. The ensuing public debate led many women to discuss their experiences for the first time.

That was a shift away from the previous rules, in which victims stayed silent. But the partisan aspect of the episode meant that the new conversation about assault was still a form of group morality and a way to conform to group judgments. Opposing sexual assault became a way to call Mr. Trump unfit for office, and so it fit within the familiar context of partisan rivalry.

But the more recent accusations — affecting Democrats as well as Republicans — have scrambled that partisan logic and made such group moral decision-making more difficult.

Meanwhile, the old norms of gender roles and hierarchies have not disappeared, and may conflict with new demands for accountability. There is no safe harbor of conformity to be had.

It would be convenient if doing the right thing were easy. But bringing long-hidden harms to the surface cannot help disturbing the status quo. Accounting for years of wrongdoing is costly, and dismantling hierarchies that fostered harm can lead, in the short term, to chaos. Now society must decide how many of those costs it is willing to bear.",REAL
Conservationists Face Once-Remote Prospect in Arctic Drilling Fight: Defeat,"The moment seems certain to be decisive on both sides of the battle.

Drilling proponents see the measure as one of responsible energy development for the good of Alaska and the nation. Oil and gas production in a portion of the refuge would generate $1.1 billion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. And, proponents note, every barrel of oil from America is one not purchased from overseas.

For environmental activists, protecting the refuge is about preserving the fragile beauty of the Arctic wilderness — where caribou herds calve, polar bears den and millions of migratory birds gather — just as the effects of global warming are becoming more pronounced in the far north than almost anywhere else on earth.

At the heart of the debate, the opposing sides agree, is a clash of values. What is more important: the environment or economic development?

“Is this too sacred a ground to be disturbed by oil and gas drilling? It’s a question of what we are willing to accept as a society,” said Mark Myers, former director of the United States Geological Survey and a former Alaska Department of Natural Resources commissioner.

Mr. Myers said he believed that drilling could be achieved with strong environmental protections. But, he acknowledged, the choice of whether to open the Arctic is a visceral one.

“Is it painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa?” he said. “That’s the fundamental question Congress has to wrestle with.”

The origins of the battle over the refuge date back decades.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower placed the area under federal protection in 1960. Twenty years later, President Jimmy Carter expanded the refuge and set aside 1.5 million acres between the Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea — known as the 1002 area, after the provision that created it — to be set aside for the possible study of oil and gas development.

The law left it to Congress to decide whether to allow drilling in the 1002 area, drawing the fault lines that would define the political battle. Since then, successive Republican efforts to open the refuge have failed in Congress or been killed by presidential vetoes.

Photo

The closest drilling advocates came to success was in 2005, but Senator Cantwell, who was a freshman at the time, mounted a filibuster that ultimately stopped a provision in a military spending authorization that would have opened the refuge.

This time, the decisive role could fall to Senator Murkowski, the chairwoman of the Senate’s energy panel who has introduced legislation to open the Arctic wilderness every term she has served in the chamber.

“Right now, Lisa Murkowski may well represent the 50th vote, and that puts her in the driver seat to ask for whatever she wants. The things she seems to want most is opening the Arctic refuge,” said Niel Lawrence, Alaska program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Even the most ardent opponents of opening the Arctic refuge, often referred to by its acronym ANWR, say they realize this week could mark the moment they definitively lose the legislative battle over drilling. But neither side is ready yet to acknowledge defeat or declare victory.



Mr. Portman, who is deputy director of Alaska’s Resource Development Council, said he wouldn’t celebrate until a bill was signed into law. “I just don’t want to get my hopes up so much and set myself up for another disappointment,” he said. “I will not be standing up applauding until I see a vote that is in our favor and it goes to Congress and ends up on the president’s desk.”

To be sure, the tax bill could still collapse. Even if it passes, the Senate bill will have to be reconciled with a version that passed the House of Representatives that does not currently include the drilling provision. Moderate Republicans, some say, could still sink the effort.

“We’ve seen it before,” said Byron L. Dorgan, a Democratic former senator from North Dakota who is now lobbying to block drilling. “The potential exists to have some people say, ‘If ANWR is in, I’m out of it.’ We’ll see. Anything is possible.”

Drilling supporters, for their part, say they are grateful that Congress appears poised to send a message that economic prosperity is the government’s primary goal.

“It’s a very strong message to the people of America that we are on a very different pathway now,” said Gail Phillips, a former speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives. Ms. Phillips, who has called the refuge a “frozen wasteland,” said allowing drilling there would send an important signal that “there are other big projects and we are open to doing these things.”

For all the brave words of environmental activists, that’s precisely the prospect that worries them most. If they lose the fight over the Arctic refuge, they say, there’s no telling what could be lost next.

“This is one of the unique places on the planet,” Mr. Dorgan said. “Is everything for sale?”",REAL
E.P.A. Heads to Coal Country to Hear Views on an Obama Climate Rule,"Mr. Pruitt did not attend.

Holding the hearing in West Virginia “is like holding the only hearing on financial deregulation at the Wall Street Hilton — it does not denote a keen interest in alternative views,” Michael B. Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, said in an interview last week.

So many people requested time to speak that they were spread out over three meeting rooms in the state capitol during the two days set aside for the hearing.

During the morning hearing, Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia, led off the speakers, saying that the power plan “is not only unlawful, but it’s bad policy as well.” He led the coalition of states that sued to stop the power plan. The Supreme Court in February delayed enforcement of the regulation. (In similar fashion, a number of Democratic state attorneys general, including Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, have pledged to fight the repeal in court.)

Robert E. Murray, founder and president of Murray Energy, a major coal producer, exulted, “In President Trump, we finally have a president who has vowed to preserve coal jobs.” The Obama administration’s rule, which he called the “so-called and illegal Clean Power Plan, better known as the no-power plan,” would impose “massive costs on the power sector and American consumers” while eliminating even more coal jobs.

Before the hearing began, Mr. Murray warmly greeted dozens of miners whom his company brought in by bus for the event. “You all know you have to work the afternoon shift now,” he joked.

Several groups are also holding an alternate hearing across the Kanawha River, at the University of Charleston, to discuss the environmental, health and climate benefits of reducing coal consumption. “The Clean Power Plan has a lot of support,” said Bill Price, a local organizer for the Sierra Club who grew up in the area and whose father worked in the coal mines. Since the shift to power sources like solar and wind create jobs and clean the environment, he said, the Clean Power Plan is “pro-worker, pro-economy and it’s pro-environment.”

Some of the speakers marveled at the turnaround on environmental regulation that a change in administrations had wrought. Speaking in favor of repeal, Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association said, “I don’t think we have ever testified in favor of anything the E.P.A. has ever done.”

Opponents of repeal attending the hearing offered rebuttal. Jim Probst, West Virginia coordinator for Citizens Climate Lobby, said that he was speaking with future generations in mind, and said that it was wrong to blame regulations for coal’s woes. “The reality is that the coal industry has been in decline for many years.”

Liz Perera, climate policy director of the Sierra Club, testified that the Trump administration had “inappropriately cooked the books” on the costs and benefits of the plan. “This is about the kind of world we will leave for our children,” she said.

Stanley Sturgill, a retired Kentucky coal miner who has become an activist, started out at 3 a.m. to get to the hearing. Now 71 and afflicted with black lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, he called repealing the plan “immoral and indefensible.” He repeated a comment he gave in support of the plan in 2014: “We’re dying, literally dying, for you to help us.”

Coal-fired power plants are a major source of greenhouse gases: they produce about one-third of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions.

This is the sole hearing scheduled on repealing the plan; the Obama administration held four such hearings in creating it. A spokesman for the E.P.A. said, “We continue to assess the needs for additional hearings, and in the meantime encourage all stakeholders to submit their comments to the public docket, which will be open until January 16, 2018.”",REAL
Gene Therapy Hits a Peculiar Roadblock: A Virus Shortage,"Few gene-therapy companies have the factories or expertise to make the viruses for use in clinical trials, where standards are exacting and comprehensive. The firms that can do it are swamped with orders and requests.

The result is a logjam. Firms exploring new gene therapies may wait for years in line for bespoke viruses, said Dr. Jim Wilson, director of the gene therapy program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.

“It’s a real issue,” said Udit Batra chief executive of MilliporeSigma, which makes viruses under contract for drug companies.

MilliporeSigma and other such manufacturers, he added, are “oversubscribed, although companies like ourselves have doubled capacity to keep up with the demand.”

One of the few big companies producing a gene therapy, Novartis, recently got approval from the F.D.A. to market a treatment for a rare blood cancer.

But to get the viruses it needed, Novartis signed up years in advance with Oxford BioMedica, agreeing to three contracts starting in 2013 that, with incentives, add up to as much as $195.2 million and that included a provision to pay Oxford a share of the royalties when the drug was approved.

Only a few hundred patients a year might need Novartis’s treatment, and the company is charging $475,000 for the one-time therapy.

Other gene therapy companies are not always able to afford the manufacturing costs or find a manufacturer. Some have taken to buying slots in virus production queues years in advance — like buying a nonrefundable airline ticket long before your vacation and hoping you can get away when the time comes.

Other firms are hedging their bets. Worried that production at one company will fail — as can happen with the finicky viruses — they buy places in line at two contract companies.

Still other biotechs have simply been shut out, unable to get their viruses made.

Then there is BioMarin, one of the larger and more successful biotech companies, which decided to spend several hundred million dollars to build its own virus-manufacturing plant. It does not plan to make viruses for anyone but itself.

“We don’t want to be in a queue, that’s for sure,” said Robert Baffi, head of technical operations at BioMarin. The new facility also will give the company complete control over manufacturing, he added.

A Difficult Road

The process of developing a gene therapy usually starts with academic researchers who do the preliminary tests. For the viruses they need, they often turn to a few academic medical centers with expertise in the requirements for early clinical research.

But there, too, demand far exceeds capacity. At Indiana University, “we are backed up through 2018,” said Dr. Kenneth Cornetta, a professor of molecular and medical genetics.

After a gene therapy gets through initial tests in an academic setting, researchers may license it to a biotech company or form their own small company. Then they have to find a manufacturer who will make their viruses according to the exacting standards required for treating patients.

Delays arise at every step. The contract virus-maker has to translate the small-scale production used for research purposes into a recipe for commercial production, where standards are extensive and documentation exhaustive. And the maker has to negotiate a contract to do all this.

Those two steps can easily take a year, said John Dawson, chief executive of Oxford BioMedica. When the contractor finally is ready to start making the viruses, it can be six months to a year before they are ready — assuming there are no glitches along the way.

Manufacturing custom-made viruses can cost biotech firms a third or more of their development budget, even for diseases so rare that they expect to treat only a dozen or so patients in their final study, Dr. Wilson said.

The gene therapy companies often have no drugs on the market and need money. But investors have become wary of companies that do not have a ready source of viruses.

“You’ve got to believe that every time someone gives a pitch to an investor, the investor will say, ‘What are you doing about manufacturing?’” Dr. Wilson said.

The whole development enterprise has become nerve-racking, researchers said. “You don’t know until the end that you have a product that is good enough to be used in a treatment,” said Dr. David Williams of Harvard.

Or, as officials at Bluebird Bio can attest, whether you have any product at all.

The company was formed in 2010, hoping to show that gene therapy could work in adrenoleukodystrophy, a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease that strike boys. That was before the virus production logjam had begun, and all seemed well. Bluebird gave a virus manufacturer its recipe for making needed viruses.

Then, said Nick Leschly, the company’s chief executive, he got bad news. Using Bluebird’s recipe, the manufacturing company said it was going to cost Bluebird a million dollars to create enough viruses to treat one patient.

The company scurried to find ways to improve the efficiency of its recipe. Finally, they were ready to start anew. Manufacturing began, but months later there was nothing to show for it.

“We got no virus,” Mr. Leschly said.

“It was an Apollo 13 moment,” he added. “We put everyone in a room and said, ‘We have to figure this out. Everything at the company is now stopped. Nothing can be done without virus.’”

They finally found the source of the problem — the acidity of the solution used to grow the viruses was slightly off, killing them.

While the recipe for making viruses can affect prices, the cost of a new treatment also depends on how many patients will take the drug and how many cells from each patient must be altered by a virus.

If a company wanted to deliver a gene therapy to the lung or liver, where the organ’s “surface area is huge,” the current price could be as much as $3 million per patient — “commercially unviable,” said Mr. Dawson of Oxford BioMedica.

Oxford is improving its methods, he said, and should soon be able to cut that cost to approximately $300,000 per patient. Methods are improving, Mr. Dawson said, and his expectation is that it might cost a mere $30,000 for the viruses in the future.

The costs of testing the drug and marketing it are, of course, out of his hands.",REAL
"As Health Care Changes, Insurers, Hospitals and Drugstores Team Up","Given the uncertainty over the Affordable Care Act and the potentially limited appeal of the core insurance business, insurers are looking to follow the strategy pursued by UnitedHealth Group. The big insurer, which acquired a chain of outpatient surgery centers earlier this year, has a wide array of profitable health care businesses like its own pharmacy benefit manager and various consulting arms through its Optum unit.

While the companies promote these partnerships to employers and consumers as one-stop shopping, they could also put customers at a disadvantage by limiting their choices and increasing medical costs.

Under these arrangements, people may not be able to see doctors outside the organization’s own medical group. In addition, patients may worry that their doctor will decide not to order an expensive test to exact savings for the business partners — the insurer and the health organization. An in-house pharmacy benefit manager could direct customers to certain drugs because its manufacturer offers hefty rebates even if the medicine is more expensive or does not work as well as a competitor’s.

And the combined clout of the companies could push consumers’ expenses higher.

Employers that purchase coverage on behalf of their workers may also have difficulty determining how much they are paying for a given medicine or a particular service, said Edward A. Kaplan, a senior vice president at Segal Consulting. There’s already a lack of transparency when it comes to drug prices, and employers may have even less information if the insurer and the pharmacy benefit manager are the same entity. “It’s going to be harder for us to get behind the curtain,” Mr. Kaplan said.

Companies are actively looking for partners that will provide an entree into new businesses or a new supply of customers. CVS Health, which started as a drugstore chain, operates a large pharmacy benefit manager as well as walk-in clinics in its drugstores. By combining with Aetna, which covers about 22 million people, CVS would be able to direct members to its own mail-order and pharmacy business and to its walk-in clinics, located in its drugstores, for much of their care.

“It’s a sign of the continued integration in health care,” said Tom Robinson, a partner for Oliver Wyman, a consultant that estimated there have been about 200 partnerships created between insurers and large health groups in the last five years. By sharing in the profits or losses of these ventures, the parties say they work more closely to make sure a patient gets the right medicine or has access to a doctor at a nearby clinic instead of resorting to an emergency room.

The savings can be tangible. Anthem, which recently announced that it plans to start its own pharmacy benefit manager, estimated it could save $4 billion a year, the bulk of which it said would result in lower drug costs for customers.

These partnerships can also represent a dramatic departure from the status quo. In many situations, an insurer and a hospital group would barely talk to each other outside a meeting every year or so to haggle over how much to pay for a knee replacement or an overnight hospital stay. The discussions rarely include how to better manage the care of a patient whose asthma goes untreated or has back pain that would be better treated with physical therapy.

The contract negotiations between insurers and hospital systems tend to be “a zero-sum game,” said Brigitte Nettesheim, a senior executive with Aetna. Once the contract is signed, and a conflict arises over the cost or choice of a treatment, the patient is the one often caught in the middle.

Aetna started offering joint plans with Inova, a large organization in Northern Virginia, in 2013. The partnership now covers more than 193,000 people. Patients see a doctor who belongs to a special network of primary-care physicians and specialists, most of whom are not employed by Inova but work together closely with the system to coordinate care for patients.

Inova was able to finance the creation of this network through the joint venture, and it is now experimenting with new ways of paying the network’s doctors so they bear more responsibility for the overall effectiveness of the care they deliver. If they save money by caring for the patient more efficiently, they share in the savings.

Patients in these joint ventures are also assigned a nurse who helps them navigate the system. When a cardiologist prescribed a new cholesterol medicine that required a $200 co-payment, the nurse was able to call the doctor to find a less expensive alternative, saving the patient nearly $2,300 a year, Ms. Nettesheim said. “It’s about these open lines of communication,” she said.

When Banner Health, a large group based in Phoenix, partnered with Aetna to offer a joint health plan, it decided to add 35 retail clinics where people could get care after-hours or closer to their homes rather than show up in the system’s emergency rooms. The clinics “are lower-cost options for our members and more convenient,” said Chuck Lehn, the president of the Banner Health Network.

It’s too soon to tell whether these new combinations will succeed in delivering on the promises made when they join forces. “They just tied the knot,” Mr. Robinson of Oliver Wyman said. “Now they have to build the relationship.”",REAL
"Hooray for Fiona the Hippo, Our Bundle of Social-Media Joy","“We think this is just Michelle’s way of one-upping her groupie status,” said Chad Yelton, the zoo’s vice president of marketing. “She has all the merch, the tumblers, the calendar. If there’s something with Fiona’s face on it, she has to have it first.”

When Fiona was born, no one expected her to survive. Bibi, her lumbering, obstinate mother (“Fiona gets all of her diva tendencies from her mom,” said Christina Gorsuch, the curator for African mammals) gave birth six weeks early, and the baby weighed only 29 pounds. Most viable hippos weigh between 55 and 120 pounds at birth; premature infants rarely pull through. “In the first six weeks, there was at least once a week when we were sure she was going to die,” said Ms. Gorsuch, who was wearing a pair of hippo-shaped stud earrings in her office next to the antelope pen. “I kept telling the keepers to call me in the middle of the night when the inevitable happens.”

She was kept in the bestial equivalent of a newborn I.C.U., with round-the-clock care that included visits from local nurses from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital who located her tiny veins for an IV during a nasty bout of dehydration. Scientists at the zoo milked a hippo for the first time — “we had no idea what was in hippo milk before now,” Ms. Gorsuch said — so that they could recreate the formula for Fiona’s bottles. Every day, between January and May 15, when Fiona finally was able to promenade around the hippo tank for the public, seemed to bring a new health crisis. All of this was documented on social media for the world to see.

Overnight, Fiona became a symbol of resilience and positivity. Buzzfeed ran listicles of her bravest moments, calling her a “sassy, unbothered, unproblematic queen.” NPR ran a national report on her swelling celebrity status. One website called her “The Only Good Thing Left in This World.”

“Fiona is one of a kind, there’s no doubt about it,” said Thane Maynard, the director of the zoo, who talked to me in the zoo’s giant boardroom, featuring a lacquered mahogany table and several figurines of rare African mammals. The room would not have felt out of place in Disney’s Adventureland. Mr. Maynard was wearing a safari shirt and khaki pants, held up by a belt featuring a giant silver buckle of an elephant’s head. “Around here I’m known as the King of Khaki,” he said.

He knew Fiona was an international phenomenon after going on his yearly exotic birding expedition to the Black Rock Lodge in rural northern Belize. Fiona was only 6 weeks old at the time. Mr. Maynard overheard two strangers from California talking at the lodge about how grateful they were to have Wi-Fi in the jungle so they could get their “Fiona fix” on Facebook. “That’s when I knew, boy, she really is a rock star,” he said. “It’s Fiona’s world and we are just living in it.”

It was shortly after he returned from Belize that the call came from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Mr. Maynard said yes right away. “Look, this idea of telling a hopeful story is important to what zoos do,” he said. “We don’t need to be in the bad-news business. People love a story where everything looks dark and then heroes save the day. Fiona came here in the year 2017, a year when we need a lot more good news. And there she is, our good-news emissary.” (It should be noted that the Cincinnati Zoo was in particular need of good news in 2017, given that its last year was dominated by controversy about killing an adult gorilla after a child fell into his habitat.)

Mr. Maynard says that other zoo directors have begun to approach him about how he turned Fiona into the sensation she has become. The publicity team’s decision to share updates on the hippo from the beginning was unconventional; most zoos wait to share information on troubled animals. “Now we are getting asked at conferences about how we did it,” Mr. Yelton said. “We tell people, you have to find your Fiona, whatever that may be, and just tell the story.”

Ms. Curley said, “We have tried to say we are going to stop posting about her every day, but we get 100,000 commenters telling us they must have updates. Everyone is so invested now.”

“People tell us all the time that Fiona is something everyone can agree on,” said Amy LaBarbara, the zoo’s coordinator for marketing and events. “We have heard from countless people online that Fiona has been uniting the United States. We hear from people going through chemo that tell us she is the only bright spot in their day.”

Photo

Angela Hatke, the zoo’s communications coordinator, said: “Every time we post a photo of her weight, we get messages about body positivity. We aren’t saying these things. These are the fans coming up with it on their own.”

The fervor around Fiona makes sense, given the polarized, tense, mass anxiety swirling around the country this year. When times get rough, we tend to project our hopes and fears onto animals. It happened during the global economic meltdown, when the baby polar bear Knut became the undeniable star of the Berlin Zoo, raised by hand by his trainer after his mother, Tosca, rejected him in 2006. (Knut’s entire short life was blanketed by controversy — are polar bears meant to be raised by humans? — and ended in tragedy, as he slipped into the water and drowned in front of horrified zoogoers in 2011.)

As the animal philosopher Steven Cave wrote in an essay about Knut’s death, the bear’s story serves as a poignant cautionary tale about celebrity animals: “We might search for nature in zoos, but what we find are our conflicting ideas of nature reflected back at us. Those who believe we can live in harmony with the beasts and so redeem ourselves will try to catch the eye of the next animal superstar.” Of the bronze statue of Knut that now stands in the Berlin Zoo, he writes, “It is not Knut the Dreamer, but Knut as we dream him who is realized in bronze for future generations to chirp and coo over.”

In other words, it can be dangerous to overhype and anthropomorphize wild animals, as we project our fantasies and desires onto them and turn the narrative into a heartwarming tale that serves to reaffirm our own sense of goodness. The animal becomes a meme, a product, a unit of sale. As the late critic John Berger wrote of celebrity creatures living in zoos: “This reduction of the animal, which has a theoretical as well as economic history, is part of the same process as that by which men have been reduced to isolated productive and consuming units.”

And yet, many of Fiona’s keepers insist that she courts and adores the attention. “She absolutely knows she is a star,” Ms. Gorsuch said. “I’ve been in this industry over 20 years and I’ve never seen or experienced or heard anything like this. She loves the camera. She has the biggest personality. And yet she is clearly a hippo. When we reintroduced her to her parents, she knew how to be a hippo immediately. She has an incredible ability to balance her little worlds; being an animal, and being in public.”

The day I visited Fiona, Cincinnati was chilly and overcast and only a few fans were lingering around Hippo Cove, the $7.5 million enclosure that opened in 2016 and offers visitors the rare opportunity to view hippos as they frolic underwater. Fiona was out and spinning, like “Fantasia” brought to life. But where the vintage Disney version of hippos in tutus now feels more like a cruel, shaming joke, the experience of watching Fiona pirouetting felt joyful and buoyant. A roly-poly imp, she swam underneath the 3,300-pound body of Bibi, her mother. Fiona’s father, Henry, was inside, having suffered for months with infection and weight loss, an old man in hippo years at 36.

Two weeks later, on Halloween, the zoo announced his death. “He was also smitten with Bibi, the zoo’s 18-year-old female, and followed her everywhere,” the zoo wrote in a statement. Fiona “was the sixth calf that Henry sired over the years and, because she survived against all odds, has become a celebrity and an ambassador for the species. He couldn’t have left a better legacy.”

Fiona’s celebrity has undeniably been good for human business. A local brewery, Listermann, began making a #TeamFiona New England I.P.A. in June, and the first edition of the beer sold out within a day. (At least 10 people camped out in front of the brewery, which is a local hangout for zoo employees, to get a case.) Jared Lewinski, a brewer there, told me that they are now on their fifth edition, and plan to make a special commemorative ale for Fiona’s first birthday in January. After pledging to donate 25 percent of all beer sales to Fiona’s treatment, the brewery has now raised over $30,000.",REAL
Leaning on the Stars to Make Sense of the World,"One appeal is that they offer some order in an otherwise chaotic city and volatile world, said Galit Atlas, a clinical assistant professor in New York University’s postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.

“What makes us feel safe in the world is order, boundaries and sequence, and those three things are things that astrology can give us,” Ms. Atlas said. “Especially in a time when the world doesn’t feel safe, we tend to search for an order that makes sense.”

“That’s not a negative thing,” she added. “The more secure we feel in the world, the more we’re able to be productive — to live fully, to love and to work.”

Astrology is believed to have first appeared in ancient Babylon some 4,000 years ago. But as a written art in newspapers and magazines, the practice is comparatively new — about a century old. (The first horoscope column in a major newspaper graced the pages of The Sunday Express in London in 1930.)

There is no formal schooling to be an interpreter of the stars. But there are well-known newspaper horoscope columnists, like the English astrologer Patric Walker, who have mentored New York writers. Mr. Walker, who died in 1995 and was widely considered the most eloquent wordsmith in the history of horoscope writing, trained Sally Brompton, his successor and the current astrologer for The Post. His work also inspired Mr. Coppolino to shift from shoe-leather reporting to covering the planets in his online magazine Planet Waves and later at The Daily News.

“I had no interest in astrology; I couldn’t see the use of it and it didn’t seem practical,” Mr. Coppolino said. “But when I started reading Patric Walker in The New York Post, I suddenly found myself with a guy who wrote like Steinbeck.”

He added: “By day I was covering toxic tort litigation, and at night I would hang out in my girlfriend’s room in Woodstock and pore through the ephemeris and the New York Post horoscope with a red pencil and tarot deck, and I hacked the Patric Walker horoscope, like Julian Assange.”

For 23 years, Mr. Coppolino, who grew up in Marine Park, Brooklyn, and went to John Dewey High School, has been writing what he describes as “news astrology,” or reporting on current events through the lens of planets, houses and signs. The first major story he covered using astrology was the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.

More recently, he has used astrology to help him interpret news of three hurricanes, Harvey Weinstein, North Korea, the mass shooting in Las Vegas and the terrorist attack in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Coppolino studied the time and place of the New York truck attack (an “event chart”) to examine questions about the driver, Sayfullo Saipov, and how the tragedy happened. The chart, “like an objective map to the situation,” pointed to “sexual agony, loneliness and a sense of being homesick,” as part of Mr. Saipov’s motivation, Mr. Coppolino wrote in Planet Waves. And when looking at the time and place of Mr. Saipov’s birth (a “natal chart”), Mr. Coppolino saw “a person under extreme inner pressure, but also with the ability to be innovative.”

“I really try to avoid rationalization,” Mr. Coppolino said. “We’re not here to blame the planets, but rather, to take some guidance and use this technique for an expanded perspective.”

He added: “Most people are shellshocked right now. They’re in pain. The world is devastating. People are exhausted. And a purpose of the horoscope at that point becomes a spiritual touchstone.” (Mr. Coppolino views his audience as the everyday New Yorker, “human beings on the D train” or “people on their way to work.”)

But not everyone sees horoscopes as providing comfort or legitimate answers to life’s questions. John Marchesella, president of the New York City chapter of the National Council for Geocosmic Research, a nonprofit group that promotes astrological education for professional astrologers, dismissed horoscope writing as amateur, comparing it to “junk food,” or “a crumb” of astrology.

“To call it even a slice is giving it too much credence,” he said. “The sun sign column is only a sliver of what astrology can provide to people.”

But Rebecca Gordon, the astrology columnist for Harper’s Bazaar and founder of My Path Astrology School in New York 12 years ago, disagrees. She described horoscope columns as a way to promote astrology.

“That’s how most people find out that astrology exists,” she said, which is why “it’s so important that we give quality literature, quality interpretation, quality astronomy and astrology.”

Ms. Gordon explained how astrology writing is moving away from “your grandmother’s monthly horoscope” to something more modern that can serve a savvier readership.

Saturn’s move from a fire sign to an earth sign next month, for example, will usher in a sobering period, according to Ms. Gordon. Mr. Marchesella said the shift would represent “significant changes in governmental administration.” Mr. Coppolino said “we are entering the biggest point in reckoning in American history since the Civil War.”

“Between different astrologers, describing a chart is like poets describing a tree,” Mr. Coppolino said. “You’re going to get 20 different poems.”

“But the conversion from that to that,” he added, waving a finger from his astrology table to a draft of his next horoscope column, “that’s where the mystery is. That’s where the art is.”",REAL
Why Is This Bacterium Hiding in Human Tumors?,"The colon cancer story began in 2011, when Dr. Matthew Meyerson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Dr. Robert A. Holt of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia independently reported finding Fusobacteria, which normally inhabit the mouth, in human colon cancers.

That instigated a rush to confirm. Researchers around the world reported finding Fusobacteria in colon cancers, but their work only raised more questions. The new paper, by Dr. Meyerson and his colleagues, provides some answers.

The group looked at human colon cancers that had spread to the liver. The liver tumors were surgically removed and examined as long as two years after the patient’s initial colon cancer surgery.

The tumors that had been infected with Fusobacteria in the colon continued to be infected even after spreading to the liver, the researchers found. Liver cancer cells containing the bacteria did not appear to be newly infected, Dr. Meyerson said.

Colon tumors that did not originally have the bacteria did not have them after spreading to the liver. The researchers also looked for the bacteria in cancers that arose first in the liver, not in the colon. They found none.

“By far the most likely explanation is that the cancer metastasizes to the liver and carries this microbiome with it,” Dr. Meyerson said. “The bacteria are not there by chance.”

“It’s kind of amazing that the bacteria are such an integral part of the cancer,” he added.

Dr. David Relman, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at Stanford and the Palo Alto VA, agreed: “This really suggests they may be traveling with the cancer.”

Dr. Meyerson and his colleagues also transplanted human colon cancers into mice. The cancers grew. The scientists plucked out pieces of the tumors and transplanted them to other mice, where once again they grew.

The researchers did this repeatedly, moving the cancers through four generations of mice. The Fusobacteria remained with the cancers.

Yet when they treated the mice with an antibiotic — metronidazole — that kills Fusobacteria, the tumors grew much more slowly. As a control, the researchers treated some mice with erythromycin, an antibiotic that Fusobacteria resist. Tumor growth was unaffected.

So should colon cancer patients whose tumors contain Fusobacteria take metronidazole? Should scientists be racing to develop a vaccine against Fusobacteria to prevent colon cancer?

Not so fast, said Emma Allen-Vercoe of the University of Guelph, who is studying the bacterium’s role in colon cancer.

The problem with antibiotics is that they kill lots of bacteria, not just Fusobacteria. The other species may be important, Dr. Allen-Vercoe said, and may even slow the progression of colon cancer.

“We don’t know enough yet to be able to predict the effects of a given antibiotic, and since everyone has a different gut microbiota, such a therapy will likely be hit and miss,” she said.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Another problem, said Dr. Holt, is that patients would have to take the antibiotic indefinitely, because Fusobacteria are constantly being reintroduced into the mouth. If a person stopped antibiotic treatment, the bacteria could once again get into their tumor cells.

As for a vaccine, Dr. Allen-Vercoe said, not all strains of Fusobacteria are linked to cancer. “Of the few strains that are, there is no clear consensus on why they are behaving pathogenically,” she added. “And so there is no clear target for a vaccine strategy.”

Dr. Vogelstein suggests that instead of directly causing cancer, Fusobacteria might be altering patients’ immune response — and perhaps their response to treatments that use the immune system to destroy cancers.

Alternately, perhaps the bacteria are acting more directly by secreting chemicals that spur growth in nearby cancer cells, Dr. Relman said.

“It is not unreasonable to say Fusobacterium is promoting or contributing to colon cancer,” he said.

Are Fusobacteria guilty of causing cancer? If this were a criminal case, where the jury had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, Dr. Meyerson said he would have to acquit.

But if it were a civil case, judged on the preponderance of the evidence, his vote would be different: Fusobacteria are guilty.",REAL
"Review: ‘Bombshell’ Tells the Amazing Story of Hedy Lamarr, the Star and Inventor","Photo

“Any girl can be glamorous,” the actress Hedy Lamarr once said. “All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.” It’s a withering observation, especially for a Hollywood star once known as “the most beautiful woman in the world.” Beauty brought Lamarr fame, at least until everything fell spectacularly apart; as with too many actresses, beauty was also her gilded cage. The new documentary “Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story” shows how hard and how long she struggled to escape it — including through her invention in the 1940s of a groundbreaking communication system that underlies modern encryption.

The story of that invention has been told before though it’s curiously missing from Lamarr’s contribution to a dubious 1966 memoir, “Ecstasy and Me: My Life as a Woman,” which, bizarrely, includes an introduction by a shrink. (She unsuccessfully tried to stop its publication.) The title refers to the 1933 film that set her on the path toward scandal and stardom. Directed by Gustav Machaty, “Ecstasy” involves a young woman’s sexual desire and disappointment, and remains best known for the sight of its teenage Viennese star — then called Hedy Kiesler — frolicking naked and, more notoriously, feigning orgasm. (Machaty apparently jabbed her with a pin to achieve the desired writhing.)

By 1938, Hedy Kiesler had been renamed Hedy Lamarr, and she was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and starring alongside Charles Boyer in the romantic thriller “Algiers.” It was Boyer’s show; Lamarr was a side dish. In his review of the film, the critic Otis Ferguson all but shrugged her off as “the girl,” while movie magazine writers slobbered over her looks. “No more beautiful woman,” one columnist gushed, “has ever stormed the doors of moviedom than Hedy, grey-eyed, raven-haired Viennese known as the ‘Ecstasy Girl.’” Four years later, Lamarr was still battling such typecasting blather, despite having patented a secret communications system called frequency hopping.

Directed by Alexandra Dean, “Bombshell” is a very enjoyable addition to what has become a minor Hedy Lamarr industry that includes documentaries, books and stage productions. Like some of these other accounts, this documentary traces the arcs of Lamarr’s personal and professional lives, which by turns harmoniously converged and wildly veered in opposite directions. Whatever happened, it was rarely dull. The daughter of assimilated Jews, she married a munitions magnate who came with a castle and did business with Mussolini. When she decided to ditch her husband, she staged (or so she claimed) an escape that turned her into the heroine of her own thrilling adventure.

Lamarr’s subsequent tenure in Hollywood comes across as tame by comparison. There were tasty and dreary roles, missed opportunities and heartbreak. She married again (and then four more times) and raised a few children, one of whom she treated unspeakably. She also tinkered and she invented. At home, Lamarr had what her biographer Richard Rhodes, one of the movie’s on-camera experts, describes as an inventing table. Howard Hughes gave her a small version of this setup, Mr. Rhodes explains, that was kept in the trailer she used while shooting films. Hughes also lent her a few of his chemists for one of her projects; for her part, Lamarr counseled him on a plane design.

Video

Ms. Dean relates Lamarr’s ventures, those onscreen and off, with savvy and narrative snap, fluidly marshaling a mix of original interviews and archival material that includes film clips, home movies and other footage. Ms. Dean’s most valuable resource, though, are Lamarr’s taped interviews with Fleming Meeks, a journalist. In a 1990 Forbes article, he helped refurbish her legend by recounting how some 50 years earlier Lamarr — who wanted to contribute to the war effort — created a communication system with her friend, the composer George Antheil. What she was after was a radio-controlled torpedo that couldn’t be jammed. Her solution: randomly switched frequencies.

By the time Mr. Meeks wrote about Lamarr, she was in her 70s and no longer of use to Hollywood. That part of her story is bleakly familiar; it’s a sad, maddening movie-industry refrain, especially for older actresses. Another hurdle, as “Bombshell” makes clear, is that a female performer who subverted expectations — who was smart and not just lovely — wasn’t welcome in the world. Some of the period coverage of Lamarr’s invention attests to this. “It does seem incredible that anyone as beautiful and as fragile-looking as the luscious Hedy could be mechanically minded,” one 1942 magazine story trumpeted, adding that “she can sing, has a flare for designing and interior decorating.”

Over Lamarr’s lifetime, the brilliance of her discovery was overshadowed by the spectacle of failure as her stardom gave way to forgettable roles, misfires, catastrophes and more scandal. “Bombshell” sympathetically tracks her downward spiral without reducing her to the sum of her misfortunes. That’s a relief and seems right given how tough and proud Lamarr can sound in the interviews. Back in 1942, in that breathless story about her invention, Lamarr insisted that she hadn’t changed. “I’ve always been as I am today,” she said. “If I am a ‘new Hedy’ as some say, it is because they are seeing me as I really am, not looking at the outside of me.” History finally figured out that she was right.",REAL
