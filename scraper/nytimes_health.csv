"Without Obamacare Mandate, ‘You Open the Floodgates’ for Skimpy Health Plans","While repeal supporters argue that people would benefit by having the choice to buy less expensive plans, state regulators have been cracking down on rogue agents who have misled customers about what such inexpensive plans cover or more important don’t.

Examples abound of people who are dumped from such policies or denied coverage, mired in debt and medical bills totaling thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.

One case pending in federal court involves Kevin Conroy, who had a heart attack in 2014 and underwent triple bypass surgery, just two months after his wife, Linda, obtained a short-term policy over the telephone.

Their insurer, HHC Life, refused to pay the bills.

“We freaked out,” Ms. Conroy said. “What were we going to do? It was $900,000.”

The insurer informed the Conroys the policy was “rescinded,” to use the industry jargon. After poring through his medical records, HCC claimed Mr. Conroy failed to disclose he suffered from alcoholism and degenerative disc disease, conditions he said were never diagnosed. “When one thing didn’t work, they went to another,” Mr. Conroy said.

HCC Life, a unit of Tokio Marine HCC, says it will defend its case. The company is also the subject of a multistate review by insurance regulators to see if it engaged in unfair or deceptive acts. It says it has fully cooperated. HCC Life stopped selling short-term policies last May.

A major player in this area is UnitedHealth Group, which abandoned the Affordable Care Act market after incurring sizable losses. United offers short-term plans through its Golden Rule unit. Before the federal law, Golden Rule was among those insurers criticized for rescinding policies. The company recently told investors it was excited by the president’s executive order because that would mean an increase in business for these plans.

Last year, a short-term policy averaged $109 a month for an individual, according to a recent analysis by eHealth, an online broker, compared with $378 a month during last year’s open enrollment period for an A.C.A. plan.

The policies are particularly attractive to the millions of people who don’t qualify for federal subsidies; only about half of the 17 million people buying coverage are subsidized, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Another target audience would be the 28 million who are uninsured. And some brokers are deliberately promoting the policies without pointing out they do not meet the same levels of coverage of A.C.A. plans, said Scott Flanders, the chief executive of eHealth. “They’re selling the hell out of it,” he said.

Jeff Smedsrud, a founder of Healthcare.com, an online insurance shopping site, “There are companies that aggressively, and some very aggressively, market it as a panacea.”

In recent years, state regulators have investigated the marketing practices of particular brokers, and consumers have sued to expose the actions of some bad actors.

In Pennsylvania during the past two years, the state took action against seven agents for misrepresenting the plans they sold. One woman who had a stroke was left with $250,000 in unpaid medical bills because the policy did not cover prescription drugs and other basic treatment.

While a handful of states, including New Jersey, now effectively ban short-term plans, others review rates and make sure the policies follow state law, said Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University.



But other states will likely do little to prevent more sales of these policies, said Katherine Hempstead, a policy expert at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “You’re going to make it easier in places where it is already easy,” she said.

Industry experts estimate as many as a million people may now have these policies, though the official tally is much lower. And others may fall under this umbrella, because it’s hard to distinguish from alternatives, like so-called limited benefit plans, which cap how much the insurer will pay, and association plans, available to small businesses, that will also be expanded under Mr. Trump’s executive order.

Several companies are poised to capitalize on a less restrictive environment. Health Insurance Innovations, which markets short-term policies, including those once offered by HCC Life, is under scrutiny by state insurance regulators. It recently told investors that there were “tens of millions” of people who could benefit from these plans. The company declined to comment.

These plans typically offer much higher commissions to brokers selling them, and they can be much more profitable for insurers. UnitedHealth’s Golden Rule spent about half of every dollar it took in premiums for medical expenses, according to regulatory filings. Under the federal law, insurers must spend at least 80 cents of each dollar on care for their customers. UnitedHealth declined to comment.

Some experts speculate that insurers are likely to exploit the existing A.C.A. market as a way of selling short-term policies to people until they have serious medical conditions. Coverage sold under the federal law would become increasingly expensive, with people priced out of the market if they didn’t get subsidies, Mr. Laszewski, the industry consultant, said.

While the market for subsidized coverage is largely protected, the market for those who pay the full cost is already shrinking, he said.

Like the insurance that was sold before the federal health care law, people with chronic conditions or a history of illness are mostly turned away. Companies will sometimes rescind policies if an individual has high medical bills.

UnitedHealth’s Golden Rule recently won a lawsuit involving one of its short-term policies, claiming it did not have to cover $400,000 in medical bills because it said a woman with breast cancer had an abnormal mammogram before she enrolled. The case is being appealed.



“Insurance companies today are interpreting their short-term health insurance policies so as to label any condition that arises during the policy term as a pre-existing condition for which the company can exclude coverage,” said a lawyer representing Ms. Jones in a statement. UnitedHealth declined to comment.

Customers often have had to argue about whether something was a pre-existing condition. When Karen Campbell and her husband looked for insurance before Obamacare, “we had this extensive, unbelievable interview, each of us about our medical history,” she said. After rupturing her Achilles’ tendon, which required $30,000 in surgery and physical therapy, the insurer asked for medical records to make sure it wasn’t something she previously had. “They just made it really difficult,” Ms. Campbell said.

Grace Wood, an instructor at a university in San Francisco, bought a short-term plan in 2013. When she had to have a heart procedure, her insurer, HCC Life, balked, leaving her with roughly $150,000 in unpaid medical bills.

“Why should I go bankrupt?” Ms. Wood recalled asking herself. It took her a year and a half, but she appealed and turned to regulators when the insurer ignored her. HCC eventually paid the claims.",REAL
What Causes Bell’s Palsy?,"Photo

Q. What causes Bell’s palsy?

A. Bell’s palsy is a temporary partial facial paralysis that occurs when the nerve controlling the facial muscles is inflamed. But identifying the underlying cause of the inflammation “is a question for the ages,” said Dr. Joseph Safdieh, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology.

The current prevailing theory is that Bell’s palsy develops after a viral infection activates the immune system, Dr. Safdieh said, adding that “once the immune system is activated, it goes and attacks a nerve.” The condition usually affects only one side of the face, causing asymmetry or drooping on one side (the reason for that is not known either).

Some experts believe Bell’s palsy is related to the herpes simplex or common cold sore virus. But several large randomized controlled trials that compared treatment with antiviral agents and prednisolone, an oral steroid that suppresses the immune system, found the steroid to be most effective. The results reinforce the idea that the condition is caused by an immune system reaction rather than the virus itself, Dr. Safdieh said.

The condition has also been associated with recent vaccinations and upper respiratory infections, “but many people are vaccinated and have upper respiratory infections and don’t develop Bell’s palsy,” Dr. Safdieh said. “The ultimate answer is ‘we don’t know,’ but that many things that activate the immune system can trigger it.”

One specific cause that should be ruled out is Lyme disease, especially if Bell’s palsy develops in the summer or early fall or in children, in whom it is less common, Dr. Safdieh said. Treatment will differ if the patient has Lyme disease.

Bell’s palsy is also associated with sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that involves other parts of the body as well and is more common in African-Americans; both pregnancy and diabetes increase the risk for Bell’s palsy.

Bell’s palsy is often treated with oral steroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone. The earlier treatment starts, the better, but “most patients have a complete recovery within three months,” Dr. Safdieh said, though sometimes symptoms last longer and, in rare cases, never completely disappear. The disorder may also recur.",REAL
How Running May or May Not Help the Heart,"But, adding still more complexity to the issue, other recent studies have indicated that, even if longtime endurance athletes do develop heart problems such as atherosclerosis, their version of the disease may be different from and more benign than the types of heart disease that develop in less active people.

It was in hopes of bringing more clarity to the increasingly tangled question of how endurance training affects hearts that researchers from the University of Minnesota, Stanford University and other institutions decided, for the new study, to zero in on a unique group of runners: men who had participated in at least 25 consecutive Twin Cities marathons in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

These 50 runners, identified by marathon participation logs, turned out to have completed, collectively, 3,510 marathons, with each runner, individually, having finished anywhere from 27 to 171 of the races.

The men obviously were experienced endurance athletes. They had trained for at least 26 years, and some for more than 50. Many had started competing in high school or earlier, but others had come to the sport much later, often, the researchers report, in hopes of ameliorating the effects of past lifestyle choices, such as smoking or junk food diets. Most were lean at the time of the study, but a few qualified as overweight, based on their body mass indexes.

Most ran 30 miles per week or more.

The researchers had each of these runners fill out detailed questionnaires about their training routines, as well as their general health history and habits.

Then they scanned the runners’ hearts to look for atherosclerosis.

Sixteen of the runners proved to have no plaque in their arteries at all. The rest had some deposits, with 12 displaying slight amounts, another 12 moderate levels, and 10 having worrisomely large deposits of plaques.

When the scientists compared the men’s running histories to their scan results, however, they found little relationship between how much they had run overall and how much plaque they had in their arteries. Those men who had run the greatest number of marathons did not tend to have less, or more, arterial plaque than the men who had run fewer races, indicating that extreme running itself had not increased the severity of heart disease.

On the other hand, a history of heavy smoking and high cholesterol was linked to greater levels of plaque, especially in the men who had begun running later in life.

The good news was that these findings suggest that years of hard running had not harmed the men’s hearts, says Dr. William O. Roberts, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of Minnesota, who led the study, which was published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. Indeed, all that running probably helped to keep some runners’ arteries clear.

But the exercise also had not inoculated those with a history of unwise lifestyle choices, especially smoking, against developing heart disease.

“You can’t just outrun your past,” Dr. Roberts says.

Of course, this study was relatively small and focused on Caucasian men with the physical, economic and psychological wherewithal to run competitively for years. Whether the results apply equally to other people and other sports is unclear. (Dr. Roberts and his collaborators published a small study earlier this year of female marathon runners that found almost no plaques in their hearts.)

This type of study also can show only relationships between running and heart health. It cannot prove that running directly caused any changes in the heart.

Still, the results may help to quell some runners’ and their families’ worries about the cardiac demands of long-term training. But if you misspent your youth smoking and eating poorly or have a family history of cardiac disease, you might want to talk with your physician about having your heart assessed, Dr. Roberts says, even if you have completed a marathon or two, or even 100.",REAL
Therapy for Sexual Misconduct? It’s Mostly Unproven,"Still, there is reason to think that these therapeutic approaches can be adapted to treatment of the men accused of offenses ranging from unwanted attention to rape.

“You’re really looking at two categories of people,” said Rory Reid, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has a clinical practice focusing on sexual problems.

“One is what I call sexually compulsive behavior. The other is reserved for people committing non-consensual acts — sex offenders.”

The first group includes the college student failing out because he spends all his time surfing porn sites, or the man who is visiting prostitutes so often it’s threatening his livelihood and health.

Therapists treat these types much as they would substance abusers: with 12-step programs; group counseling sessions; and by teaching classic impulse-control techniques, like avoiding friends, social situations and places like bars that put them at high risk of repeating the behavior.

The services offered resemble those for other kinds of compulsive behavior, like gambling and drug use. There are life coaches, couples counselors and hypnotherapists, as well as residential clinics with names like Promises and Gentle Path at the Meadows.

It is not at all clear how well such addiction-based approaches work — if at all. And that’s especially true for men in the more serious offender category, who are more likely to respond to confrontation, experts said.

“Confrontation itself — being busted or outed, as so many are now publicly — is enough to curtail or end the behavior in many cases,” particularly when the offender has a lot to lose in terms of money and standing, said James Cantor, director of the Toronto Sexuality Center.

When confrontation is not enough, the therapist has alternatives. People who commit sexual assaults often minimize their behavior. One way to counter this is by having patients be more accountable and adopt appropriate language describing their offense, Dr. Reid said.

For example, a perpetrator needs to describe acts as an assault — to say “I forced my hand down her pants,” rather than “I went a little too far.”

Dr. Reid helps patients cultivate victim empathy by having them attend court-sentencing hearings, where victims read detailed accounts “and the impact isn’t sugarcoated” so offenders can “start to understand how an assault forever changes lives.”

The evidence is weak for empathy training in offenders, through techniques like role-playing and taking a potential victim’s point of view, said Michael Seto, director of forensic rehabilitation research at the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group.

“It’s hard to teach empathy,” he said. “Accepting responsibility is often done confrontationally instead of collaboratively.”

Dr. Wright, of the psychologists’ association, said repeat offenders’ social assumptions are often worth challenging in therapy as well.

“This is worth trying if, for instance, the serial harasser has these assumptions that, for instance, ‘Well, I’m not hurting the person, because I’m not touching her or I’m touching gently — that’s not a big deal,’” Dr. Wright said.

“Those are simply inaccurate thoughts, and it is possible to break them down.”

From there, the playbook is similar to that used to treat men with more severe disorders, Dr. Seto said. Amplify the person’s motivation to change by, say, getting them to describe the loss they face in their work, their family, their reputations.

Build awareness of what triggers the bad behavior — that is, not merely the presence of an attractive target, but the setting in which this occurs. Distraction, relaxation, meditation: these techniques can help, too, in the person who takes them seriously, as ways to offset bouts of anxiety or despair that can make willpower go right out the window.

Serial harassers, though often caricatured, do not fit any personality type or types. There’s the brash executive who gets what he wants; the doe-eyed guy with the man-bun in a loft; the nerdy good listener who likes to give shoulder rubs.

To the extent that their misdeeds are at least partially rooted in unacknowledged feelings of inadequacy or abandonment, traditional psychotherapy also has a role, experts said.

Having a measure of power can turn such longstanding psychological wounds into surreptitious excuses for exploitation. It’s my turn now; all those women who ignored me in high school have to line up at my door.

But only if the harasser is willing, committed and genuinely humbled is therapy likely to be anything more than a ruse to buy some sympathy — and worse, perhaps an eventual return to the field.

What to make of the harasser who is entirely unrepentent? “I don’t think we have a diagnosis yet,” said Dr. Cantor. “And we certainly don’t have a treatment.”",REAL
Gene Therapy Hits a Peculiar Roadblock: A Virus Shortage,"Few gene-therapy companies have the factories or expertise to make the viruses for use in clinical trials, where standards are exacting and comprehensive. The firms that can do it are swamped with orders and requests.

The result is a logjam. Firms exploring new gene therapies may wait for years in line for bespoke viruses, said Dr. Jim Wilson, director of the gene therapy program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.

“It’s a real issue,” said Udit Batra chief executive of MilliporeSigma, which makes viruses under contract for drug companies.

MilliporeSigma and other such manufacturers, he added, are “oversubscribed, although companies like ourselves have doubled capacity to keep up with the demand.”

One of the few big companies producing a gene therapy, Novartis, recently got approval from the F.D.A. to market a treatment for a rare blood cancer.

But to get the viruses it needed, Novartis signed up years in advance with Oxford BioMedica, agreeing to three contracts starting in 2013 that, with incentives, add up to as much as $195.2 million and that included a provision to pay Oxford a share of the royalties when the drug was approved.

Only a few hundred patients a year might need Novartis’s treatment, and the company is charging $475,000 for the one-time therapy.

Other gene therapy companies are not always able to afford the manufacturing costs or find a manufacturer. Some have taken to buying slots in virus production queues years in advance — like buying a nonrefundable airline ticket long before your vacation and hoping you can get away when the time comes.

Other firms are hedging their bets. Worried that production at one company will fail — as can happen with the finicky viruses — they buy places in line at two contract companies.

Still other biotechs have simply been shut out, unable to get their viruses made.

Then there is BioMarin, one of the larger and more successful biotech companies, which decided to spend several hundred million dollars to build its own virus-manufacturing plant. It does not plan to make viruses for anyone but itself.

“We don’t want to be in a queue, that’s for sure,” said Robert Baffi, head of technical operations at BioMarin. The new facility also will give the company complete control over manufacturing, he added.

A Difficult Road

The process of developing a gene therapy usually starts with academic researchers who do the preliminary tests. For the viruses they need, they often turn to a few academic medical centers with expertise in the requirements for early clinical research.

But there, too, demand far exceeds capacity. At Indiana University, “we are backed up through 2018,” said Dr. Kenneth Cornetta, a professor of molecular and medical genetics.

After a gene therapy gets through initial tests in an academic setting, researchers may license it to a biotech company or form their own small company. Then they have to find a manufacturer who will make their viruses according to the exacting standards required for treating patients.

Delays arise at every step. The contract virus-maker has to translate the small-scale production used for research purposes into a recipe for commercial production, where standards are extensive and documentation exhaustive. And the maker has to negotiate a contract to do all this.

Those two steps can easily take a year, said John Dawson, chief executive of Oxford BioMedica. When the contractor finally is ready to start making the viruses, it can be six months to a year before they are ready — assuming there are no glitches along the way.

Manufacturing custom-made viruses can cost biotech firms a third or more of their development budget, even for diseases so rare that they expect to treat only a dozen or so patients in their final study, Dr. Wilson said.

The gene therapy companies often have no drugs on the market and need money. But investors have become wary of companies that do not have a ready source of viruses.

“You’ve got to believe that every time someone gives a pitch to an investor, the investor will say, ‘What are you doing about manufacturing?’” Dr. Wilson said.

The whole development enterprise has become nerve-racking, researchers said. “You don’t know until the end that you have a product that is good enough to be used in a treatment,” said Dr. David Williams of Harvard.

Or, as officials at Bluebird Bio can attest, whether you have any product at all.

The company was formed in 2010, hoping to show that gene therapy could work in adrenoleukodystrophy, a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease that strike boys. That was before the virus production logjam had begun, and all seemed well. Bluebird gave a virus manufacturer its recipe for making needed viruses.

Then, said Nick Leschly, the company’s chief executive, he got bad news. Using Bluebird’s recipe, the manufacturing company said it was going to cost Bluebird a million dollars to create enough viruses to treat one patient.

The company scurried to find ways to improve the efficiency of its recipe. Finally, they were ready to start anew. Manufacturing began, but months later there was nothing to show for it.

“We got no virus,” Mr. Leschly said.

“It was an Apollo 13 moment,” he added. “We put everyone in a room and said, ‘We have to figure this out. Everything at the company is now stopped. Nothing can be done without virus.’”

They finally found the source of the problem — the acidity of the solution used to grow the viruses was slightly off, killing them.

While the recipe for making viruses can affect prices, the cost of a new treatment also depends on how many patients will take the drug and how many cells from each patient must be altered by a virus.

If a company wanted to deliver a gene therapy to the lung or liver, where the organ’s “surface area is huge,” the current price could be as much as $3 million per patient — “commercially unviable,” said Mr. Dawson of Oxford BioMedica.

Oxford is improving its methods, he said, and should soon be able to cut that cost to approximately $300,000 per patient. Methods are improving, Mr. Dawson said, and his expectation is that it might cost a mere $30,000 for the viruses in the future.

The costs of testing the drug and marketing it are, of course, out of his hands.",REAL
"As Health Care Changes, Insurers, Hospitals and Drugstores Team Up","Given the uncertainty over the Affordable Care Act and the potentially limited appeal of the core insurance business, insurers are looking to follow the strategy pursued by UnitedHealth Group. The big insurer, which acquired a chain of outpatient surgery centers earlier this year, has a wide array of profitable health care businesses like its own pharmacy benefit manager and various consulting arms through its Optum unit.

While the companies promote these partnerships to employers and consumers as one-stop shopping, they could also put customers at a disadvantage by limiting their choices and increasing medical costs.

Under these arrangements, people may not be able to see doctors outside the organization’s own medical group. In addition, patients may worry that their doctor will decide not to order an expensive test to exact savings for the business partners — the insurer and the health organization. An in-house pharmacy benefit manager could direct customers to certain drugs because its manufacturer offers hefty rebates even if the medicine is more expensive or does not work as well as a competitor’s.

And the combined clout of the companies could push consumers’ expenses higher.

Employers that purchase coverage on behalf of their workers may also have difficulty determining how much they are paying for a given medicine or a particular service, said Edward A. Kaplan, a senior vice president at Segal Consulting. There’s already a lack of transparency when it comes to drug prices, and employers may have even less information if the insurer and the pharmacy benefit manager are the same entity. “It’s going to be harder for us to get behind the curtain,” Mr. Kaplan said.

Companies are actively looking for partners that will provide an entree into new businesses or a new supply of customers. CVS Health, which started as a drugstore chain, operates a large pharmacy benefit manager as well as walk-in clinics in its drugstores. By combining with Aetna, which covers about 22 million people, CVS would be able to direct members to its own mail-order and pharmacy business and to its walk-in clinics, located in its drugstores, for much of their care.

“It’s a sign of the continued integration in health care,” said Tom Robinson, a partner for Oliver Wyman, a consultant that estimated there have been about 200 partnerships created between insurers and large health groups in the last five years. By sharing in the profits or losses of these ventures, the parties say they work more closely to make sure a patient gets the right medicine or has access to a doctor at a nearby clinic instead of resorting to an emergency room.

The savings can be tangible. Anthem, which recently announced that it plans to start its own pharmacy benefit manager, estimated it could save $4 billion a year, the bulk of which it said would result in lower drug costs for customers.

These partnerships can also represent a dramatic departure from the status quo. In many situations, an insurer and a hospital group would barely talk to each other outside a meeting every year or so to haggle over how much to pay for a knee replacement or an overnight hospital stay. The discussions rarely include how to better manage the care of a patient whose asthma goes untreated or has back pain that would be better treated with physical therapy.

The contract negotiations between insurers and hospital systems tend to be “a zero-sum game,” said Brigitte Nettesheim, a senior executive with Aetna. Once the contract is signed, and a conflict arises over the cost or choice of a treatment, the patient is the one often caught in the middle.

Aetna started offering joint plans with Inova, a large organization in Northern Virginia, in 2013. The partnership now covers more than 193,000 people. Patients see a doctor who belongs to a special network of primary-care physicians and specialists, most of whom are not employed by Inova but work together closely with the system to coordinate care for patients.

Inova was able to finance the creation of this network through the joint venture, and it is now experimenting with new ways of paying the network’s doctors so they bear more responsibility for the overall effectiveness of the care they deliver. If they save money by caring for the patient more efficiently, they share in the savings.

Patients in these joint ventures are also assigned a nurse who helps them navigate the system. When a cardiologist prescribed a new cholesterol medicine that required a $200 co-payment, the nurse was able to call the doctor to find a less expensive alternative, saving the patient nearly $2,300 a year, Ms. Nettesheim said. “It’s about these open lines of communication,” she said.

When Banner Health, a large group based in Phoenix, partnered with Aetna to offer a joint health plan, it decided to add 35 retail clinics where people could get care after-hours or closer to their homes rather than show up in the system’s emergency rooms. The clinics “are lower-cost options for our members and more convenient,” said Chuck Lehn, the president of the Banner Health Network.

It’s too soon to tell whether these new combinations will succeed in delivering on the promises made when they join forces. “They just tied the knot,” Mr. Robinson of Oliver Wyman said. “Now they have to build the relationship.”",REAL
New Recognition for Chronic Fatigue,"For patients struggling to get recognition that they are suffering from a serious physiological illness with real symptoms, the goal remains to have doctors take the problem seriously and prescribe an evidence-based approach to treatment that offers hope for relief.

Medical practitioners who remain disease deniers may think differently after learning about factors that can precede an attack of ME/CFS and the abnormalities now known to often accompany it. For example, one person in 10 who meets the diagnostic criteria for this syndrome reports that it followed an infection with Epstein-Barr virus, Ross River virus or Coxiella burnetii, a bacterium that causes Q fever.

The syndrome is also often accompanied by immune system disruptions, including chronically high levels of cytokines that change how the body responds to stress; poor function of natural killer cells that diminish the ability to fight infections, and abnormal activity of T-cells needed for an appropriate response to infection.

The core symptoms of the syndrome make it clear that this is not a matter of malingering. No one with an appreciation for life would pretend to be so debilitated. As the C.D.C. put it, “People with ME/CFS have fatigue that is very different from just being tired. The fatigue of ME/CFS can be severe; is not a result of unusually difficult activity; is not relieved by sleep or rest, [and] was not a problem before becoming ill.”

Furthermore, the agency explains, symptoms of the syndrome typically get worse “after physical or mental activity that would not have caused a problem before” the illness developed. Following even minimal exertion, patients tend to “crash” or “collapse” and may require days, weeks or longer to rebound. As mundane an activity as grocery shopping, attending a school event, preparing a meal or even taking a shower may force a retreat to bed.

Patients do not feel rested even after a good night’s sleep, and sleep is often abnormal — falling asleep or staying asleep may be difficult. Brain function is often described as “foggy,” causing problems with memory, quick thinking and attention to details. Some patients feel lightheaded, dizzy, weak or faint when they sit or stand.

Muscle and joint pain unrelated to an injury is a common accompaniment, as well as headaches that are new or worse than previously. Some people also have tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpits, a frequent sore throat, chills and night sweats, allergic sensitivities or digestive problems.

Estimates of the number of people in the United States afflicted with the syndrome range from less than one million to 2.5 million. The range of estimates is wide because of varying definitions of the disease and, as the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) stated in a 2015 report, the condition has not been diagnosed in 90 percent of those affected by ME/CFS.

To arrive at an accurate diagnosis, the doctor should review the patient’s personal and family medical history, conduct a thorough physical and mental status exam, and order blood, urine or other tests. Patients should be asked about how they functioned before and after they became ill and what now makes them feel worse or better.

Correctly diagnosing ME/CFS, hard enough in adults, is even more of a challenge in children and adolescents, whose problems both within and outside of school can be misattributed to a neurological, learning or psychosocial disorder or simply laziness.

Management of youngsters with the syndrome requires a team approach with flexible educational resources and demands suited to each child’s ability to meet them.

There is currently no known cure for ME/CFS and patients should be wary of any therapy that claims otherwise. When embarking on treatment, the C.D.C. recommends first tackling the symptom or symptoms that are causing the most problems. If it is disrupted sleep, for example, start by setting a regular bedtime routine, going to bed and waking at the same time each day, limiting naps to 30 minutes a day and removing all distractions, including television, computers, phones and electronics, from the bedroom.

If muscle or joint pain is especially debilitating, consult a pain specialist if over-the-counter remedies are not sufficiently helpful. Those with memory or concentration difficulties might benefit from drugs used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, as well as relying on organizers and calendars to keep track of important matters.

Waiting for Depression to Lift,"‘“I just feel utterly hopeless,” I say. The depression is a silent, slow motion tsunami of dark breaking over me. I can’t swim away from it and don’t believe I can survive its natural withdrawal. That’s why I am here.

This was over a year ago, and I’m still alive, thanks primarily to mental health care professionals and the passage of time. Over the course of the past decade, I have struggled with the exhilarating highs and excruciating lows of bipolar disorder, or manic-depression. I’ve spent a cumulative nine months living on psychiatric units.

All these units were locked down, regulated, sterile. I ate food off hard plastic trays with soft plastic cutlery. When the medications I swallowed in front of policing nurses behind their grimy desks caused my skin to flake into dead orangish chunks and hang from my face, I stole mini-packs of butter from the patients’ fridge and used it as a moisturizer. I hid the foil-and-plastic wrappers in a drawer with my hospital-issue white gauze underwear, which bulged slightly at the crotch, an accommodation to those patients who were male.

I have stared out windows for hours; a person trudging down the treeless street excited me as a major event. Between events, I named the landscape’s components in my head: single yellow line, grass, ugly rock, rakish slope toward road.

The unit I am on this time is all grays and beige and stale air. The doctor prescribes lithium, supposedly the bipolar miracle drug. I take the button-size white pill dutifully with endless Dixie cups of brackish fountain water from the nurses’ station. Yet, my depression continues.

The second bed in my room, which sits unfortunately close to the hallway’s clamoring communal telephone, is empty, and each morning I wake to a nurse asking, however gently, to take my blood pressure. The hospital’s red brick walls, visible through my window, remind me of my early childhood home in England, of churches and moderate antiquity.

A week in, during dialectical behavior therapy group in the cafeteria, I see a tall woman about my age with long dark hair and warm but haunted brown eyes being gently seated in the plastic-upholstered two-seater across from me. She has blackish bruises around her mouth and nose. She sits as though her spine is a column of brittle ash. Earlier that day, she’d attempted suicide by lithium overdose. My new roommate.

She wakes each morning an hour before me, making her bed with meticulous care, smoothing each wrinkle from the absurdly white hospital blankets. As she puts the finishing touches on her outfit and starts arranging the cushions brought by her husband from home on her bed’s pristinely smooth surface, I drag my sweaty self out from under the three, four, five blankets that fail to keep me feeling warm through the night. I make my way to the industrial-gray bathroom, splash cold water on my face and drag a hospital-issue black comb through my hair.

By the time I emerge, my roommate is sitting on the edge of her bed, her hands clasped in her lap. I look guiltily over at the knot of wadded white blankets and sheets on my still-damp bed.

“How are you?” she asks.

“Fine,” I say.

She looks away.

The nurse arrives to dress the wound in her neck, the result of where she had intubation for emergency dialysis after her overdose. I can’t see the wound, but she has complained that it means she cannot wash her hair for three days, the hair she keeps swept into braids or up-dos, always impeccable.

I flinch as the nurse swabs ointment onto her neck, then covers the area with a gauze pad before walking out. My roommate looks up at me, her eyes wide with concern.

“If you ever want to talk,” she says, “I’m here to listen.”

“Oh, thank you,” I say, thinking I could never possibly upset this girl with the impeccable hair. “You can talk to me, too, if you like.”

Next time, walk her through one of the meticulously reported stories of harassment — or don’t. For some nonbelievers, this may be analogous to the gay rights movement: They may need to know one brave accuser personally before believing (and supporting) the others. But never fear: I suspect there are many still to come.

Friend or Ghost?

I have a close friend who doesn’t respond to calls or texts when she wants to get out of a plan we’ve made. Then she claims to have “missed the messages.” This seemed plausible the first time, but after six more, not so much. The last time, I wanted to say something because the lie was transparent, and it hurt my feelings. But I don’t want to spoil our relationship. Any ideas?

J. D.

This is a common problem — by which I mean, I have behaved as badly as your friend. I was fearful that saying no to invitations, or “I’ve had a rough day. Can we reschedule?” would make my pals angry. So, I froze and did nothing, then cooked up some baloney to feed them later. It’s childish (and scarily self-important), but we all have our weak points.

Be a friend and help out. The next time you have dinner, say: “Amy, I’ll be fine if you want to cancel plans or reschedule. But pretending you didn’t get my texts hurts my feelings. Can you be more careful about that?” It didn’t spoil the relationship when my friend called me out. Like you, he was only asking to be treated respectfully.

He’s the Cat’s Meow — and Allergic to It, Too

Meanwhile, the guy won’t come to my house while the cat is here. Also, I love my cat. How would you deal with this?

Philippines Suspends Dengue Shots After Drug Firm’s Warning,"Mr. Duque said that, with an average of 200,000 people infected with dengue every year in the Philippines, vaccination was “essential.”

He said that the Department of Health would be stepping up its monitoring efforts to ensure public safety and that the department’s legal division was studying what to do with the Sanofi contract and how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of children who may have been put at risk.

Mr. Duque said that government officials had been asked to coordinate with community health experts to identify and monitor the children. He said a post-vaccination surveillance program would last for five years.

“I hope that this development will not in any way affect the expanded program of immunization because there are countless number of lives that have been saved,” Mr. Duque said, adding that 7 billion Philippine pesos, or about $140 million, had been budgeted for all government vaccination programs for the year, up from 340 million pesos in 2006.

He would not say when the program was likely to be restarted or what steps would be necessary to allow resumption.

“We need to go back quite a long way to really put the facts together,” Mr. Duque said. “Until that is available, we can’t answer all your questions with definitive responses.”

He said the vaccines that were now in stock would not be allowed to be sold unless the labels were changed to reflect the latest advisory.

Sanofi representatives in Manila were not immediately available to comment on Friday.

The Philippines became the first country in Asia to approve the commercial sale of Dengvaxia, in December 2015. Dengvaxia is the first dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi.

Health advocates in the Philippines first raised the alarm over Dengvaxia when the government announced in April last year that it would be used in the school immunization program despite the fact that it was a relatively new drug with possible unknown effects. But the government continued, budgeting about $70 million for the program.

The government has defended its use of the vaccine, saying that the treatment had undergone extensive studies and stressing that it was approved for use by the World Health Organization. The first hint that there could be something wrong was in April last year, when an 11-year-old boy with congenital heart disease died after receiving a Dengvaxia shot, but the government worked to distance the drug from the death.

Nancy Binay, a legislator in the Philippine Senate, said she was alarmed at the drug’s potential impact on public health and urged the health authorities and Sanofi to “launch a nationwide medical advisory and information drive” to contact parents whose children had been given Dengvaxia.

The recently released Sanofi medical report was “deeply shocking and disturbing,” Senator Binay said.

She said it was “sad” that the health department ignored the warnings about the lack of patient safety and research integrity in the Dengvaxia tests. “Safety should always be the paramount concern when it comes to any immunization program,” she said.

Senator Binay called on the pharmaceutical giant to explain what it meant when it warned of “severe disease.”

“We don’t want the warning to the public to come too little, too late,” she said. “Obviously, there were shortfalls and gaps in the vaccine’s safety profile, and I believe Sanofi is morally and ethically obliged to inform the public what severe diseases came out in their clinical tests.”

Dr. Anthony Leachon, an independent director at PhilHealth, a government medical insurance body, said the Philippine medical community had expressed alarm at the government’s use of the vaccine.

He said that as early as last year medical experts had told the government that there was “lingering uncertainty” about the long-term effects of the vaccine, but that their concerns had apparently been ignored.

“Evidence from manufacturer’s trials shows that there may be a paradoxical increase in the incidence of severe dengue beginning a few years after children are vaccinated, and possibly continuing for the rest of their lives,” Dr. Leachon said.

The clinical trials on the dengue vaccine were designed specifically to assess this “and sadly, this danger has been confirmed,” he said.

“Many parents, teachers and health care workers claim they were never fully informed about the benefits and potential side effects of the vaccine,” Dr. Leachon added.",REAL
Ban on Teflon Chemical Tied to Fewer Low-Weight Babies,"Photo

Banning a chemical used to make Teflon led to a sharp decrease in pregnancy-related problems.

Perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, had been used in many consumer products, including nonstick cookware, food packaging, electronics and carpets. The chemical was linked to a range of health problems, including low-weight births. Beginning in 2003, its use was gradually phased out in the United States under an agreement between government and industry, and eliminated by 2014.

Researchers used data from a larger health study to estimate levels of serum PFOA in women of childbearing age. They gathered data on birth weights from a government database. The study is in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health.

PFOA blood levels peaked in 2007-8, and then declined consistently each year through 2014. PFOA was implicated in 5 percent of low-weight births in 2007-8 and in 0.5 percent in 2013-14.

The researchers estimate that 118,009 low-weight births were prevented from 2003 to 2014, resulting in $13.7 billion in savings.

“It’s important to highlight the role of the Environmental Protection Agency in this,” said the senior author, Dr. Teresa M. Attina, a research scientist at New York University. “They sponsored a program with this goal in mind, acting in a good way by involving industry in the interest of public health.”",REAL
Air Pollution May Weaken the Bones,"Photo

Air pollution increases the risk for osteoporosis and bone fractures, researchers report.

Investigators analyzed data from two studies. The first tracked hospital admissions among 9.2 million Medicare recipients in the Northeast over eight years. The second looked at levels of parathyroid hormone, which aids bone health, in 692 middle-aged low-income men in Boston.

The study, in Lancet Planetary Health, found that the risk for bone fractures among people over 65 increased steadily as levels of air pollution — specifically, particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, or PM 2.5 — went up. Rates were almost 5 percent higher in areas with the highest concentrations of PM 2.5 than in those with the lowest.

The study in middle-aged men found that people living in locations with higher levels of air pollution had lower concentrations of parathyroid hormone and lower levels of bone mineral density.

The studies controlled for race and ethnicity, income, smoking, physical activity and other variables.

“Air pollution is like diluted smoking,” said the senior author, Andrea A. Baccarelli, a professor of environmental medicine at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. “Smoking causes cancer, cardiovascular disease and bone mineral density loss. So does air pollution. Even at pollution levels the Environmental Protection Agency considers acceptable, there is still an increased risk.”",REAL
Trauma May Have Fallout Over Generations,"Photo

The daughters of women exposed to childhood trauma are at increased risk for serious psychiatric disorders, a new study concludes.

Researchers studied 46,877 Finnish children who were evacuated to Sweden during World War II, between 1940 and 1944. They tracked the health of their 93,391 male and female offspring born from 1950 to 2010.

The study, in JAMA Psychiatry, found that female children of mothers who had been evacuated to Sweden were twice as likely to be hospitalized for a psychiatric illness as their female cousins who had not been evacuated, and more than four times as likely to have depression or bipolar disorder.

But there was no effect among male children, and no effect among children of either sex born to fathers who had been evacuated.

The most obvious explanation would be that girls inherited their mental illness from their mothers, but the researchers controlled for parental psychiatric disorder and the finding still held.

The lead author, Torsten Santavirta, an associate professor of economics at Uppsala University, said that it is possible that traumatic events cause changes in gene expression that can then be inherited, but the researchers did not have access to genetic information.",REAL
"Snickers Owner to Invest in Kind, Third-Biggest Maker of Snack Bars","Last month, Kellogg announced that it will buy the maker of RX Bars, a popular protein-heavy line of snack bars, for $600 million. And three years ago, General Mills bought the Annie’s brand of organic food, which includes mac and cheese, snack bars and popcorn, for about $820 million.

As part of the deal, Mars is hoping to help catapult Kind into a global health food brand. Mars will operate Kind’s international operations and make use of Mars’s own enormous worldwide distribution network to make and market Kind products in countries like China, where Mars has over 2.3 million distribution points.

The two companies also hope to use Kind as a “platform” to introduce other healthy food products in a variety of categories over the next several years.

“Job No. 1 is taking it global. Job No. 2 is what other categories either are we already in or we can easily get into that meet the Kind promise?” Grant F. Reid, Mars’s chief executive, said in an interview.

Mr. Reid, who has spent nearly 30 years at Mars, said he had explored acquiring or making an investment in a health and wellness food company for the past several years.

For Mars, which is the sixth-largest privately held company in the United States, the deal offers a toehold into a world that touts the use of almonds, chia seeds, amaranth and buckwheat as selling points.

The company has already been inching in this direction: Last year, it announced plans to remove artificial colors from its food portfolio, which besides candy includes products like Uncle Ben’s Rice. And while Mars is best known for sweets, a huge part of its business is in pet care, both in the sale of pet food and services like its Banfield pet hospitals.

In the same way that Nabisco and Kraft stood for quality packaged food during much of the last century, Kind’s founder, Daniel Lubetzky, said he that hopes his company will become a seal of approval for any number of different health and wellness food products. One day, he speculated, Kind could sell everything from beverages to frozen foods, so long as they capture the ethos of health and wellness that he says is the company’s promise to customers.

Though it began with snack bars, Kind has branched out to granola clusters, breakfast bars and fruit bars, saying that it still uses “ a nutritious food as the first and predominant ingredient in every food product” by avoiding artificial flavors and preservatives and campaigning against added sugar.

Mr. Lubetzky, who started Kind in 2004 with a snack bar whose packaging let the customer physically see each fruit and nut up close, said he first met Mars executives and members of the Mars family about five years ago. Over the past several years, he had contemplated selling his company or taking it public, but ultimately decided that partnering with a global player and remaining private would give the company the best opportunity to grow.

He said he was particularly intrigued with Mars because it too is private, which allows them “to really think about the long term.” He added that he wanted to plan in terms of 10 and 20 years and shuddered at the thought of having to think on a quarterly basis about earnings, the way public companies do.

The exact terms of Mars’s minority stake in Kind could not be learned. Both companies said they would not disclose the price of the investment or the valuation of Kind, and declined to comment on the $4 billion figure.

Deal-making in the food and beverage industry has been proceeding at a torrid pace, with 291 transactions announced this year, the highest level in two decades, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

Mr. Lubetzky, who will remain Kind’s majority shareholder, will continue to be its chief executive and run the business in the United States and Canada. He said that he plans to work with Mars on the international business.

For Mr. Lubetzky, the deal is a kind of vindication. He had sold a stake in Kind in 2008 to the private equity firm VMG, only to buy it back in 2014. When he bought the stake back, Kind was reportedly valued at $728.5 million, a fraction of its valuation today.",REAL
Clearing the Air on Climate Education: A Reporter Returns to the Scene of Her Story,"Others, though, excoriated the students, labeling them “stupid,” among other things. “Folks,” wrote one horrified reader, pushing back after a string of such comments on The Times’s Facebook page, “you’re talking about minors.”

Some readers, especially in southeastern Ohio itself, had objected to the way I’d chosen to weave in information about the region’s socioeconomic troubles, such as the opioid epidemic and the high poverty rate. “What was gained by mentioning a child has to borrow lunch money?” one tweeted. “What did that add to the article?”

I had responded to some of these threads on social media last spring, but the prospect of doing so face to face was more unnerving. And who was to say that this was a conversation anyone in the area wanted to have?

But it seemed I would not get out of it so easily.

This fall, students in the education school at Ohio University in Athens, about 30 miles from Wellston, had been assigned by their professor, Sami Kahn, to read my article. And Dr. Kahn had invited James Sutter, the teacher I profiled, to speak at an event that was soon expanded to include me and some of the Wellston students I interviewed.

The visit, as anticipated, had its tense moments.

In a deep-red region, Athens is a liberal college town, and some community members took issue with what they saw as my kid-glove approach to climate skepticism among young Republicans (even those not yet of voting age).

“Write about how they’re being lied to,” one social science professor instructed me at the reception. “That’s what changes the minds of my students.”

“We’re past debating climate change,” an environmental activist insisted.

The Wellston students spoke openly of feeling betrayed by my mention of drugs, poverty and low enrollment in four-year colleges in an article I had told them would be about climate education.

“In our town, we are just kind of trying to survive,” said Katey King, now a freshman at the university. “We have a lot of pride.”

For my part, I was glad we were discussing the often-ignored connection between attitudes toward climate change and economic inequality. And even as I defended my effort to explain to readers why climate change might not be a priority in Wellston, I knew I would be more mindful in the future of how certain facts might be misinterpreted as judgment.

Tense moments aside, much of our conversation focused on Mr. Sutter’s remarkable teaching. Like many of the students I met in Wellston, those on the panel had, in his classroom, come to consider climate change a serious problem, and to recognize human activities as its primary driver.

There may be emotional safety in talking about your story at a physical remove from where it unfolded. But it is far more enlightening — and personally rewarding — to be there.

A few days after I had returned from Athens, I received a direct message on Twitter from Jonathan Caldwell, a senior at Ohio University in St. Clairsville. “I appreciate your work,” he wrote. His education professor, Jacqueline Yahn, had apparently also distributed my article, which he had used for a class presentation on “how we approach ideas like climate change (or any other topic that can be seen as controversial) and what responsibilities I believe we have as teachers.”

At first I thought Mr. Caldwell, who grew up in eastern Ohio and is hoping to be the first in his family to graduate from college, was simply writing to make the connection.

Then, a few days later, came the invitation: “We’re a small campus here at Eastern. But we’re really close here at the campus and I know we would love to learn from you & I think we could share a lot with you as well.”

I haven’t discussed it with my editor yet. But maybe sometime soon I’ll be heading back once again to Ohio.

Euthanasia Law Passes in Australia for First Time,"Euthanasia Law Passes in Australia for First Time Image An assisted dying bill was ratified by the state of Victoria on Wednesday, making it Australia’s first to legalize euthanasia. Credit Scott Barbour/Getty Images

MELBOURNE, Australia — The Australian state of Victoria on Wednesday became the country’s first to legalize assisted dying.



After a two and a half years of debate and amendments, Victoria’s Lower House ratified the euthanasia bill, handing a victory to the state government of Premier Daniel Andrews, who had lobbied heavily for the law.

Starting in mid-2019, the law will allow Victorians with a terminal, incurable illness — and, in most cases, a life expectancy of less than six months — to obtain a lethal drug within 10 days of requesting it.

The state joins the Netherlands, Canada, Belgium, Colombia and Luxembourg in legalizing euthanasia. Several other countries — and states and jurisdictions in the United States, including California, Washington, D.C., and Oregon — have passed laws allowing assisted suicide, in which doctors, in certain cases, may prescribe or suggest a means in which patients may end their own lives, without directly assisting in the act.

Globally, assisted dying advocates have long argued for it on grounds of compassion and averting prolonged physical suffering for the terminally ill.

Mr. Andrews, the premier, said in a statement that the law would give those with terminal illnesses “the compassion and dignity they deserve at the end of their lives.”

In a tweet, he described Victoria’s law as the “most conservative voluntary assisted dying model that has ever been proposed — let alone implemented — anywhere in the world.”

Another Australian jurisdiction, the Northern Territory, had a short-lived assisted dying act, but it was struck down by the federal government in 1997.

Victoria’s amendments to the law make it more restrictive than those passed elsewhere. For instance, it allows a drug to be administered on behalf of a patient only if the patient is unable to administer it. Additionally, a patient needs to have been a resident of Victoria for at least one year to be eligible.

The bill faced substantial opposition, including from Mr. Andrews’s own deputy, James Merlino, who last month sought and failed to block the passage of the bill.

“My concern is proponents of this legislation will come back some time in the future and seek to expand it,” he said in a news conference at the time.

Broad concerns about the law, and the ways it may be interpreted, manipulated or expanded, led the state’s government to incorporate a slew of concessions and amendments, often in consultation with the Australian Medical Association, which advised in the process while opposing the law’s passage.

Dr. Lorraine Baker, the president of the association’s Victoria branch, acknowledged her organization’s difficulty in navigating the legislation.

“Historically, for the medical profession, everything is about preserving life,” she said. “That is such a fundamental ethical principle over centuries. However, we’re living in a society where now, in first world countries, life can be prolonged. Therefore, by default, apparent suffering can be prolonged.”

Dr. Baker said that a survey of Australian Medical Association members last year showed a strong minority of support for euthanasia policies.

“However, the majority of the profession, unsurprisingly, was opposed,” she said.

Dr. Baker said the association refrained from stronger criticism of the bill because certain elements were added, such as strong vetting and consultation with those considering ending their lives. Doctors, for instance, cannot first suggest assisted dying to a patient.

She did, however, warn of unforeseen consequences that could result from the law.

“The experience of watching people die, from whatever cause, is painful for anyone who watches it,” she said. “Whether or not it’s a well-managed dying, it’s a challenge for the people around them.”

And while opponents of the bill often argued that decisions about euthanasia should be left in the hands of the medical profession, Dr. Baker disagreed.

“Ultimately,” she said, “it’s a matter for society and the government.”

"As Walmart Buys Online Retailers, Their Health Benefits Suffer","Walmart says the share of its employees eligible for company-sponsored coverage, and of those choosing it, is slightly above the industry norm. But the health benefits it offers in its online operations appear to be inferior to those of many e-commerce competitors.

At Bonobos, an online men’s wear retailer that Walmart agreed to buy in June for $310 million, workers currently pay nothing in premiums for medical coverage in exchange for a deductible — that is, the level below which they are responsible for covering their own expenses — of $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families. A similar policy under Walmart’s plan will cost an individual about $750 more per year in premiums and a family nearly $4,000 more, according to documents on Walmart’s employee benefits website. Both plans will also feature a deductible that is 50 percent higher than the current one.

Some of the biggest changes appear to be occurring at another recent acquisition, ModCloth, an online retailer that made its name selling hip, vintage-inspired apparel to millennial women. To keep biweekly premiums for ModCloth’s roughly 300 workers relatively close to what they pay now, their deductibles will rise from nothing to several thousand dollars per year.

Some economists say that as Walmart amasses such properties, its practices could put pressure on benefits throughout the e-commerce sector, which had been a relative bright spot for low-wage workers.

“My concern is they bring their model with them regardless of what was going on before they got there,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who served as chief economic adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

Blake Jackson, a Walmart spokesman, said: “We’ve put a lot of thought into creating a total package, including both compensation and benefits, that offers more than what we’ve had in the past.”

Mr. Jackson pointed out that as new employees of the retail giant, many of the workers had gained benefits like a 401(k) retirement plan with a company match and a stock purchase plan.

Mr. Jackson said that the company would make sure its benefits largely kept up with those of competitors, and that the benefits that Walmart offered hourly e-commerce workers were essentially the same benefits it offered hourly workers in its traditional stores.

In addition to its standard health insurance benefits, Walmart covers 100 percent of the cost of certain types of major surgery, like transplants, at a top facility.

The group OUR Walmart, which prods the company to improve wages and benefits, alerted The New York Times to the changes in coverage. The group’s current campaign seeks to make ModCloth’s customers aware of Walmart’s policies. Neither Walmart nor any of its recent e-commerce acquisitions is unionized.

The new Walmart options for hourly workers prominently feature what are known as consumer-driven plans, in which workers cover all their medical expenses out of pocket, up to a relatively high deductible. A medical-expense account to which the company contributes money helps defray these costs.

One coverage option for a worker and a child, including dental and vision, has a biweekly premium of about $67 (assuming no use of tobacco products). Walmart would in turn contribute $600 to a health reimbursement account. Once that $600 is exhausted, however, the worker would have to shoulder the full amount of family medical expenses up to $5,500.

At companies with 200 or more workers, only 10 percent of those enrolled in such plans face deductibles of $5,000 or higher for family coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 2017 survey.

Photo

Larry Levitt, a health insurance expert at the foundation, said that such high-deductible plans had increasingly become the cost-containment strategy of choice among many employers, but that the particulars of Walmart’s plan made it especially ungenerous.

At Walmart’s archrival, Amazon, workers typically pay less for more coverage. A similar type of plan would cost an Amazon worker with a child about $60 in biweekly premiums, with Amazon contributing $1,000 into a reimbursement account, according to the company. (The plan includes dental and vision coverage.) After exhausting that account, the worker would pay all expenses out of pocket up to $3,000.

If a ModCloth worker with a child wanted to lower the annual deductible to $3,500 — the lowest the company offers for this type of plan — and receive a $1,000 company contribution, the biweekly premium would be about $136, or just under $2,000 more per year than the Amazon plan.

ModCloth workers were also given the option of sticking with a more conventional insurance plan, but those who do will face premiums that are roughly double their old premiums for family coverage, and their deductible will rise from nothing to $2,000.

The average full-time hourly wage at ModCloth is $13.64. (Walmart put the average wage for its full-time store employees at $13.85 per hour.) But ModCloth employees say Susan Gregg Koger and Eric Koger, who started the company when they arrived in Pittsburgh to attend college in 2002 and later married, saw generous health insurance benefits as central to their feminist values. (Ms. Koger declined to comment.)

“The health benefits were really, really good,” said Alicia Faust Ogg, who worked in returns and customer service at ModCloth between 2012 and 2014.

Ms. Ogg, who had a baby while at the company, said that she had paid nothing out of pocket for her prenatal visits and that her hospital bill for the delivery had been below $1,000.

Under ModCloth’s current insurance, workers pay biweekly premiums ranging from $6.65 for the employee alone to $144 to cover a spouse and children as well. They pay no deductible within the company’s network and a modest co-payment for most doctor visits.

But in a tough retail environment, online operations were under pressure even before Walmart’s buying spree.

In 2014, ModCloth imposed the first of several rounds of layoffs and, according to several current and former employees, gradually made its perks less generous. That included cutbacks in health coverage, they said, but it remained comprehensive and affordable before the company was sold.",REAL
"Tokyo, Once a Cigarette Haven, Could Finally Kick Out the Smokers","But more recently, the rest of the world’s no-smoking culture has spread to Japan.

As more people have grown aware of the health hazards, the number of smokers in Japan has dropped sharply, according to data from the cigarette maker Japan Tobacco. And an increasing number of employers, restaurant owners and public facilities throughout the country have voluntarily banned cigarettes after a 2002 bill that encouraged a reduction in passive smoke.

I remember being astonished the first time we saw segregated smoking lounges at Tokyo’s Narita Airport.

Now train platforms, department stores and many restaurants are smoke free, while office workers who have yet to kick the cigarette habit are consigned to small smoking rooms or outside shelters. The Ueno Zoo even announced that it was considering a smoking ban to protect visitors coming to see a newborn panda.

A more drastic step may be in store. Early next year, Tokyo’s metropolitan assembly will vote on whether to ban smoking indoors in most public places, including restaurants, hotels, offices, department stores, airports, universities and gyms. Outside, smokers would be restricted to specially designated shelters or zones.

Sure, some may still break the rules. But in Japan, a country where individuals are reluctant to stand out, many people say that if such a smoking ban is imposed, they will have no choice but to follow it.

“I will be in trouble,” said Yuta Ishimoto, 40, who has a pack-a-day habit.

On a recent afternoon he sat sending emails from his laptop and taking drags from a cigarette in a Tsubaki Café, one of a few chains of coffee shops that allow customers to light up freely. But come the ban, he shrugged, he would follow the rules. “Shikataganai,” he said, which, roughly translated, means “It can’t be helped.”

Still, as strong as the impulse is to follow the rules, the culture of smoking is also ingrained. And smoking is big business.

A law completely banning indoor smoking is “a totalitarian idea,” said Motoki Takeda, the director of the general affairs department of the Japan Tobacco Federation, which represents 60,000 cigarette sellers nationwide. “It’s almost like bullying the smokers.”

The national health ministry has proposed a smoking ban similar to the one Tokyo is considering. But the idea is trickier on a national level.

The governing Liberal Democratic Party has long resisted antismoking policies, in part because the government owns one-third of Japan Tobacco, the cigarette maker, and taxes on cigarettes generate about 2 trillion yen, or $18 billion a year — about 3 percent of total revenues.

Many Liberal Democratic lawmakers also come from rural constituencies where tobacco farmers or mom-and-pop restaurant owners hold sway over elections.

And then there is the culture of smoking.

Some lawmakers cling to an idea of Japanese culture in which people who spend their days projecting a reserved public face can unveil their genuine selves only after hours when they congregate at pubs — known in Japan as “izakaya” — to drink, eat and smoke. That combination, they say, uniquely allows restrained personalities to relax and open up.

“The izakaya is the kind of place where you can honestly talk about your true feelings or opinions,” said Akinori Eto, the chairman of the Liberal Democrats’ tobacco committee.

The health ministry recently proposed a compromise version of its smoking ban to expand an exemption so that restaurants as large as 150 square meters, or a little over 1,600 square feet, could allow smokers.

But Tokyo is likely to stick to a stricter proposal, in part to fulfill the city’s agreement with the International Olympic Committee, which requires a smoke-free environment for the 2020 Olympics, which will be held here. The governor, Yuriko Koike, is also a strong supporter of the ban and campaigned on it during the city’s election last year.

Determined smokers figure they will spend even more time cramming into outdoor smoking shelters and parks dotted around the city. Some have switched to e-cigarettes since the proposed ordinance would not cover them.

The food service industry, worried about the potential effect on business, is heavily lobbying for a more liberal exemption for restaurants and bars.

“We demand that each restaurant can make its own decision on its smoking policy,” said Hisao Fukuda, the managing director of the Japan Foodservice Association. “Smoking customers should have the right to choose restaurants that would cater to those customers with appropriately segregated smoking environments in place.”

Musashi, a Japanese robata-style barbecue restaurant tucked down an alley behind Shimbashi Station in central Tokyo, is the kind of place that would be affected by the city ban. On a recent evening, an ashtray was placed at every table setting.

Masahiro Shibatsuka, 67, an engineer who had met up with a childhood friend for drinks and a light meal of grilled squid, said the proposed Tokyo ordinance went too far. “It is violating people’s rights,” he said, waving a Hi-Lite brand cigarette and nursing an alcoholic lemon sour.

Koki Okamoto, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and head of the Neighborhood Second-Hand Smoke Victims Society, said restaurants could potentially gain customers as more people stop smoking and an increasing number of families with young children seek to go out to eat.

“If they change their mind-set, it will be possible to increase their profits or sales,” said Mr. Okamoto, who wrote a separate Tokyo ordinance aimed at protecting children from secondhand smoke.

Indeed, on the night my colleague and I visited Musashi, nonsmokers outnumbered smokers by 2 to 1. And on a visit to another cafe, when my colleague and I ordered coffee, the cashier asked whether we were O.K. with the fact that smoking was allowed on all three floors.

At Musashi, one of the smokers I spoke to, Eri Yamamoto, 25, said she would always find a way to feed her habit. But as she chain-smoked from a pack of Winstons and shared plates of grilled fish and pints of beer with two friends, she confessed, “I really want to quit.”",REAL
Cities That Never Sleep Are Shaped by Sunrise and Sunset,"Photo

Long after the sun has gone down, the electric lights keep blazing. That might suggest that most humans aren’t as influenced by Earth’s light-dark cycle as we used to be.

But a new study, drawing on the cellphone call records of more than a million people, shows that the times of day when they are active grew longer and shorter over the course of the year, waxing and waning with the daylight.

The new study, published on Tuesday in the journal PLOS Computational Biology, looked at city dwellers all living in the same time zone in southern Europe. In previous work with the same data, the researchers estimated how often users called one another.

Eventually, the scientists began to wonder whether there were patterns in the timing of calls.

As it turned out, there were clear peaks and dips in phone calls throughout the day. One peak in outgoing calls was always at midday, while another was in the evening. In one city the group studied, for example, the early peak was centered around noon, while another occurred at 9 p.m. The lowest likelihood of calls going out was at around 4 p.m. and 4 a.m.

Over the course of the year, however, there was a noticeable shift. The last call times crept later during a stretch of three or four months, even as the earliest call times grew earlier. The peak calling periods moved as well, with the morning peak moving earlier and the evening peak moving later. Then, the process reversed direction.",REAL
Older Voters Stymied by Tighter ID Requirements,"Older people vote. In last year’s presidential election, Census Bureau data show, about 64 percent of all adults had registered to vote and 56 percent reported voting.

But among those aged 65 to 74 years old, more than three-quarters had registered and 70 percent voted — a proportion that dropped only slightly in older cohorts. Even among people aged 85 and older, more than 60 percent cast ballots.

Still, we don’t make it easy for them.

Physical barriers at polling places, a longtime obstacle for the elderly and disabled citizens of any age, can prevent older voters’ participation. Voting machines may not accommodate people who use wheelchairs or are visually impaired.

The Government Accountability Office last month reported the results of a survey of 178 polling places used in 2016. Accessibility had improved since 2000, the G.A.O. concluded, but the great majority still had impediments outside — like steep ramps or inadequate parking — or inside that could discourage or exclude disabled voters.

Federal law requires accessibility, but “there’s very little enforcement and resources devoted to ensuring that older Americans and others with disabilities can vote,” said Wendy Weiser of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.

More recently, a wave of onerous state voting requirements has added to the problem, with an outsized effect on older voters, argues a new report by Senator Robert Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota.

Officials in states adopting the requirements usually cite fears of widespread fraud, a concern debunked by researchers and election officials themselves. Nevertheless, older people who’d voted religiously all their adult lives are suddenly encountering barriers that effectively disenfranchise them.

“Needing a photo ID, getting a photo ID, getting access to polling places — there are lots of obstacles for older people,” said Mr. Casey, the ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.

As voting requirements tighten, “the target may have been younger voters, poor voters, minorities,” said Richard Hasen, a specialist in election law at the University of California, Irvine. “But one of the casualties has been older voters. ”

They skew Republican, as it happens. Voters over age 65 backed Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2012 by a 56 percent to 44 percent margin, and they voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, 53 percent to 45 percent.

Nevertheless, they’ve become collateral damage in the voting eligibility conflicts that have led to protests and multiple lawsuits.

Consider the voter ID laws enacted in 32 states. Many require that the IDs, typically drivers’ licenses, be currently valid. But “older Americans are more likely to have expired IDs, or IDs that don’t have their current addresses,” said Ms. Weiser.

That can send them scrambling for the documentation that would allow them to get state voter ID cards as alternatives. But finding a birth certificate issued 80 years ago can prove burdensome.

Would-be voters may have to write to another state, may run into trouble if they’ve changed their names, may be unable to travel to state offices or to afford the fees.

“What we’ve discovered on the ground is that people are so confused and intimidated by the complex, ever-changing voter ID laws that they don’t vote even if they have the requisite ID,” said Kathleen Unger, founder of VoteRiders.

Other voting restrictions have also created barriers for older voters. Many counties have closed polling places since a 2013 Supreme Court ruling struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Almost every Arizona county closed polling places before last year’s election, for instance, a statewide reduction of 212 polling places, the Leadership Conference Education Fund has reported.

Older voters who can’t drive or easily take public transportation — where it exists — can be stymied when officials shutter polls near their homes with little notice. And with fewer polling places, even older voters who can reach the new ones may encounter forbiddingly long lines.

Moreover, using an absentee ballot has grown more difficult. Some states already limit the acceptable reasons for not voting in person.

Now, new legislation in some states forbids helpers — churches, civic groups, unions — from collecting and mailing absentee ballots, a potential hardship for older voters who can’t get to a post office or mailbox themselves.

How such changes may have affected election results “turns out to be a complicated social science question,” Dr. Hasen said. But it’s also the wrong question, he added: “The focus should be on why any eligible voter should be disenfranchised.”

States could help older voters cast ballots, experts said. Why can’t someone who no longer drives nevertheless use an expired license as a voter ID?

Dr. Hasen also suggests allowing voters without acceptable IDs to sign affidavits swearing they are who they say they are. “If I’m lying, you can sue me for perjury,” he said.

Early in-person voting, required in 36 states last year and permitted in three more, gives older voters more time to arrange rides to polls and reduces waiting time when they get there. Mailed ballots and easily obtainable absentee ballots allow participation by those who find travel a hardship.

Sixteen states required curbside voting in 2016, an inexpensive, low-tech solution. “If you lack the physical ability to walk into the polling place, workers will bring a paper ballot and envelope to the car,” Dr. Hasen said.

Older people take this civic duty seriously.

On this past Election Day in Edgewater, N.J., Roslyn Wilson, 97, took the elevator from her 12th floor apartment to the polling place right downstairs. So did her friend and neighbor, Ada, who is 102. They have voted there for years.

A few years back, borough council candidates began discussing moving the polling place from Ms. Wilson’s building, home to many seniors, to another location.

“We were all very indignant,” Ms. Wilson said. “Few of us have cars. We’d have to walk, which a lot of people can hardly do, or take a bus. Many people would have just not voted.”

Petitions began circulating almost immediately. To widespread relief, the idea quickly died.",REAL
Am I at High Risk for a Heart Attack?,"Photo

Q. How do physicians assess a patient’s risk for heart attack, and what factors are taken into consideration? After 20 years of resisting medication and being told my cholesterol numbers were so off the chart I was at extreme risk for a heart attack, I was told at my last checkup that my 10-year risk for a heart attack was only 9 percent.

A. Physicians use a number of different factors to assess your risk of having a heart attack or stroke, including your age, gender, race, total cholesterol and levels of so-called “good” HDL and “bad” LDL cholesterol. Whether you have high blood pressure or diabetes and whether you smoke are also important risk factors.

Though your level of ""bad” cholesterol is a very important risk factor, “the need for a cholesterol-lowering statin is not based solely on the LDL level, but on the other risk factors it keeps company with,” said Dr. Robert Eckel, a former president of the American Heart Association.

Weight, physical activity and diet also play a role in heart disease, though they aren’t usually included in heart risk calculators that you find online and that physicians utilize to assess risk, from groups like the American College of Cardiology. (Some heart risk calculators you’ll find online have been criticized for overestimating the risk of heart disease, but they can give you a rough idea of where you stand, as long as you’ve had your cholesterol and blood pressure tested recently).

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The estimation of risk can change based on a single factor. So, for example, while a 50- or 60-year-old woman with high LDL cholesterol but no other problems may face a very low risk of a heart attack or stroke over the next 10 years, a man of the same age with a similar profile will be at considerably higher risk. Advancing age increases the risk for both men and women.

That said, if your 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease is assessed at 9 percent, you should consider medical treatment. Current medical guidelines recommend starting nondiabetic patients ages 40 to 75 on statins once their 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease is 7.5 percent or higher.",REAL
Why Tobacco Companies Are Paying to Tell You Smoking Kills,"Mr. Myers said the ads would be less effective than originally intended because fewer people read newspapers and watch television today. The tobacco companies, he said, also negotiated to not include the phrase “here’s the truth” in the ads.

Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, declined to comment beyond an Oct. 2 release about the ads, which said it was working to make its business practices more responsible. Murray Garnick, the company’s general counsel, said in the statement that “includes communicating openly about the health effects of our products, continuing to support cessation efforts, helping reduce underage tobacco use and developing potentially reduced-risk products.”

R. J. Reynolds, which is part of British American Tobacco with Lorillard, said in an email that the company was “fully complying with its obligations under the court order.”

The initial order came from a 1,600-page civil racketeering judgment from Judge Gladys Kessler that excoriated the tobacco industry for lying about and misrepresenting its products beginning in the 1950s. She said they had sought “to make money with little, if any, regard for individual illness and suffering, soaring health costs or the integrity of the legal system.”

The corrective statements were meant to appear in places that tobacco companies had “historically used to promulgate false smoking and health messages.” In addition to the TV and newspaper ads, there will be messaging on the packs themselves and on the company’s websites, though details are still being worked out.

“I certainly don’t think that what we have finally ended up with is really in the spirit of the original ruling,” said Ruth Malone, a professor of nursing and public health policy at the University of California, San Francisco, who consulted for the Justice Department in the case.

“The original ruling was so that the American public would understand that they had been deceived through multiple means about whether smoking caused disease, whether smoking killed people, whether secondhand smoke caused disease, whether nicotine was addictive,” she said.

Proposed versions of the ads in 2011 appeared tougher. One said: “We told Congress under oath that we believed nicotine is not addictive. We told you that smoking is not an addiction and all it takes to quit is willpower. Here’s the truth: Smoking is very addictive. And it’s not easy to quit. We manipulated cigarettes to make them more addictive.”

Tobacco companies argued that the initially proposed statements were “forced public confessions” designed to “shame and humiliate them.” They also said the statements were unnecessary after a 2009 law gave the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products.

The campaign that will begin on Sunday includes five different ads with statements divided by category, such as the “manipulation of cigarette design and composition to ensure optimum nicotine delivery” and “adverse health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke.” Other statements include “Secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in adults who do not smoke” and “Smoking kills, on average, 1,200 Americans. Every day.”

Full-page ads will run online and in the Sunday issues of more than 40 newspapers, including The New York Times, on five separate days. There are also five versions of the commercials, which will run for a year on CBS, ABC and NBC in the evenings on Monday through Thursday. The spots feature a voice reading a statement as the text appears on the screen.

Altria said in its most recent annual filing that it expected actions related to the order to cost $31 million.

American cigarette manufacturers spent more than $8 billion on advertising and promotional expenses in 2014, according to the Federal Trade Commission, though the vast majority of that was through price discounts. That year, they spent $50 million on magazine ads, while newspaper spending was too limited to report. The companies are not allowed to advertise on broadcast TV.

In October, the F.D.A. expanded its public education campaign to emphasize the harmful effects of nicotine on the developing brain. The agency will follow that with ads aimed at discouraging young people from using e-cigarettes. About 15 percent of adults in the United States smoked cigarettes in 2015, compared with 43 percent in 1965, government figures show.

And while the tobacco industry has moved to create safer products, Dr. Malone said the public should understand that the companies would rather not be running the corrective statements campaign.

“The only reason they’re finally printing and broadcasting all of this is because they were forced to do so by a judge that found them guilty of racketeering,” Dr. Malone said. “Otherwise, this would still be going on.”",REAL
Why Is This Bacterium Hiding in Human Tumors?,"The colon cancer story began in 2011, when Dr. Matthew Meyerson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Dr. Robert A. Holt of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia independently reported finding Fusobacteria, which normally inhabit the mouth, in human colon cancers.

That instigated a rush to confirm. Researchers around the world reported finding Fusobacteria in colon cancers, but their work only raised more questions. The new paper, by Dr. Meyerson and his colleagues, provides some answers.

The group looked at human colon cancers that had spread to the liver. The liver tumors were surgically removed and examined as long as two years after the patient’s initial colon cancer surgery.

The tumors that had been infected with Fusobacteria in the colon continued to be infected even after spreading to the liver, the researchers found. Liver cancer cells containing the bacteria did not appear to be newly infected, Dr. Meyerson said.

Colon tumors that did not originally have the bacteria did not have them after spreading to the liver. The researchers also looked for the bacteria in cancers that arose first in the liver, not in the colon. They found none.

“By far the most likely explanation is that the cancer metastasizes to the liver and carries this microbiome with it,” Dr. Meyerson said. “The bacteria are not there by chance.”

“It’s kind of amazing that the bacteria are such an integral part of the cancer,” he added.

Dr. David Relman, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at Stanford and the Palo Alto VA, agreed: “This really suggests they may be traveling with the cancer.”

Dr. Meyerson and his colleagues also transplanted human colon cancers into mice. The cancers grew. The scientists plucked out pieces of the tumors and transplanted them to other mice, where once again they grew.

The researchers did this repeatedly, moving the cancers through four generations of mice. The Fusobacteria remained with the cancers.

Yet when they treated the mice with an antibiotic — metronidazole — that kills Fusobacteria, the tumors grew much more slowly. As a control, the researchers treated some mice with erythromycin, an antibiotic that Fusobacteria resist. Tumor growth was unaffected.

So should colon cancer patients whose tumors contain Fusobacteria take metronidazole? Should scientists be racing to develop a vaccine against Fusobacteria to prevent colon cancer?

Not so fast, said Emma Allen-Vercoe of the University of Guelph, who is studying the bacterium’s role in colon cancer.

The problem with antibiotics is that they kill lots of bacteria, not just Fusobacteria. The other species may be important, Dr. Allen-Vercoe said, and may even slow the progression of colon cancer.

“We don’t know enough yet to be able to predict the effects of a given antibiotic, and since everyone has a different gut microbiota, such a therapy will likely be hit and miss,” she said.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Another problem, said Dr. Holt, is that patients would have to take the antibiotic indefinitely, because Fusobacteria are constantly being reintroduced into the mouth. If a person stopped antibiotic treatment, the bacteria could once again get into their tumor cells.

As for a vaccine, Dr. Allen-Vercoe said, not all strains of Fusobacteria are linked to cancer. “Of the few strains that are, there is no clear consensus on why they are behaving pathogenically,” she added. “And so there is no clear target for a vaccine strategy.”

Dr. Vogelstein suggests that instead of directly causing cancer, Fusobacteria might be altering patients’ immune response — and perhaps their response to treatments that use the immune system to destroy cancers.

Alternately, perhaps the bacteria are acting more directly by secreting chemicals that spur growth in nearby cancer cells, Dr. Relman said.

“It is not unreasonable to say Fusobacterium is promoting or contributing to colon cancer,” he said.

Are Fusobacteria guilty of causing cancer? If this were a criminal case, where the jury had to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, Dr. Meyerson said he would have to acquit.

But if it were a civil case, judged on the preponderance of the evidence, his vote would be different: Fusobacteria are guilty.",REAL
Thanks a Lot! New Reasons Not to Eat Cookie Dough,"“It’s a new view of flour,” said Dr. Marguerite A. Neill, an associate professor of medicine at Brown University Medical School and an expert on food-borne illnesses, who was not involved in this study. “It would have seemed incredible that this dry, powdery substance, stored on a shelf for months, could have a live micro-organism that didn’t spoil the flour but still could make someone sick.”

Dr. Neill, herself a baker and cook, added apologetically, “It sounds like I’m being a killjoy.”

In addition to refraining from tasting uncooked flour dishes, she advised people to wash their hands in hot, soapy water after handling flour, such as after dusting a rolling pin or dredging fish fillets. As for the final product: high, sustained cooking heat will kill pathogens.

Don’t panic: the researchers’ concerns do not include commercial treats like cookie-dough ice cream and packaged refrigerated cookie dough. Ever since 2009, when a strain of E. coli from commercial cookie dough sickened 77 people, and flour was the suspected cause, ingredients are not only pasteurized but heat-treated. (This explains why those cookie dough chunks extracted from ice cream pints don’t bake up like the real thing — though people keep trying.)

Although the recall was initiated over a year ago, the broader message about uncooked flour products was not widely known. “I was shocked. I had no idea,” said Joanne Chang, founder of Boston’s Flour Bakery and Cafe, who learned the news from a reporter, as bakers for her seven branches were filling orders for 1,000 pumpkin pies. “One of the reasons I went into pastry is because you can taste as you go along. ”

Identifying the cases and the cause was a relentless undertaking that involved doctors and clinics, state health workers and investigators from the Food and Drug Administration and the C.D.C.

The symptoms patients experienced included abdominal pain, mild fever, vomiting and diarrhea, which was often bloody. Stool samples helped isolate the strain and point to a cluster. By February 2016, federal investigators started tracking the culprit.

Dr. Neill called their work “absolutely dogged.” Researchers went through tiers of inquiry, asking patients about their food-prep and eating around the time they became ill. Tasting raw baking dough was a common factor.

Early on researchers thought the tainted ingredient could have been chocolate chips.

But thank goodness scientific detection ruled those out because the bakers used different brands.

Some patients were able to retrieve the bags of flour they used; all came from the same facility in Kansas City, Mo. Some children who fell ill had come in contact with the flour by tasting homemade playdough or raw tortilla dough that they were given at a restaurant to amuse themselves.

No contamination was found at the General Mills facility where products like Gold Medal flour had been milled and packaged, researchers said. Instead, they speculated, the dangerous bacteria most likely spread earlier, as manure-dropping cattle or whitetail deer roamed through wheat fields. That means, said researchers, the bacteria, identified as two strains of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, could reappear.

Eventually, nearly 250 products containing the flour, including cake mixes, were recalled.

A spokesman for General Mills underscored the advice not to eat raw batter, saying the company cannot heat-treat flour before packaging it. Doing so “would impact its performance, such as rising properties.”

Jenny Scott, a senior adviser for the F.D.A.’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, who helped develop warnings on eating raw flour products, said that children were among the most vulnerable patients.

“As an adult you have the information to determine whether to take that risk, but when you give a child a ball of raw dough, you’re putting your risk values on that child.”

Ms. Chang, winner of the 2016 James Beard Award for Outstanding Baker, carefully sifted through her own risk analysis. At last she broke the news to some of her bakers.

“They all laughed at me,” she said.",REAL
Abnormal Proteins Discovered in Skin of Patients With Rare Brain Disease,"They deteriorate mentally, weaken, move uncontrollably, and may become blind and unable to speak. The disease belongs to the same class of brain disorders as mad-cow disease.

The findings do not mean that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be transmitted by touch or casual contact, said the senior author of the study, Dr. Wen-Quan Zou, at Case Western University School of Medicine. Patients are not dangerous, he emphasized.

The researchers also said that although the disease had been transmitted decades ago by corneal transplants and certain neurosurgical procedures, there was no definitive evidence that other types of surgery had ever spread it. And the levels found in skin are far lower than those in the brain.

Despite the new findings, there is no reason to change the medical care given to patients with the disease or to people known to have genetic mutations that may predispose them to Creutzfeldt-Jakob or related illnesses, the researchers said.

The study, by scientists at Case Western and the National Institutes of Health, was published on Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

A researcher who was not involved in the study, Kurt Giles, at the University of California, San Francisco, said that if this finding led to a new means of diagnosing the disease, that would be valuable. There is now no treatment, but if one were to become available, it will be important to correctly identify patients as early as possible, he said.

Another researcher, Dr. Laura Manuelidis, at Yale University School of Medicine, who questions whether prions cause the disease, said it was plausible that the abnormal proteins could reach the skin, but she doubted that finding them there had any implications for disease transmission.

Most cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, about 85 percent, are “sporadic,” meaning they strike out of the blue in people with no risk factors or family history. Another 5 percent to 10 percent of cases are hereditary, caused by a genetic mutation.

Fewer than 1 percent come from exposure to infected tissue from the brain or nervous system, usually during medical procedures.

One form of the disease, called new variant, has been described in Britain and France, in people younger than the usual patients. There were concerns that they might have contracted the disease from eating beef from cows with a related condition — bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad-cow disease — but the link has not been proven.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob is the most common member of a family of disorders that affect people and animals called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The diseases eat holes in the brain, leaving it looking like a sponge (hence the name). The other human ailments include kuru, fatal familial insomnia and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease.

In animals, the spongiform disorders include mad-cow disease and scrapie in sheep and goats. Another form, chronic wasting disease, is having a devastating effect on wild deer, elk and moose; it is highly contagious among the animals.

The leading theory for the cause of these diseases is that a healthy protein normally found in the body somehow folds into an abnormal shape — a prion — and then sets off a chain reaction in which other normal proteins also misfold, clump together and cause brain damage. Dr. Stanley Prusiner, at the University of California, San Francisco, coined the term prion and won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research on the diseases.

In the new study, Dr. Zou and his colleagues collected skin samples from patients and sent them for testing to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont., part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Byron Caughey, a senior investigator at the laboratories, said the scientists wanted to find out whether skin could be used to make a Creutzfeldt-Jakob diagnosis more easily, something he said would be especially helpful in countries where brain biopsies, spinal taps or autopsies would be difficult or impossible.

The researchers used a highly sensitive assay to look for prions in skin samples from 23 patients, including 21 with the sporadic form and two with the new variant. They also analyzed skin from 15 people who did not have Creutzfeldt-Jakob, as controls.

The assay found prions in all 23 patients and in none of the controls.

The researchers also injected brain or skin extracts from two patients directly into the brains of mice that were specially developed to be vulnerable to the human disorder. All the animals developed prion diseases, but the skin extracts took much longer to make the animals sick.

Shooting infectious material directly into the brain is an extreme measure with high odds of spreading disease, so the study does not imply that skin poses any risks in real life, Dr. Caughey cautioned, adding that more research is needed to determine what the findings mean.",REAL
Dog Owners Live Longer,"Photo

A Swedish study suggests that owning a dog is linked to a reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and death.

Researchers used demographic data on 3.4 million Swedes ages 40 to 80. In Sweden, all dogs are registered with the Swedish Board of Agriculture and identified by number with an ear tattoo or a subcutaneous chip.

Anyone with a record of cardiovascular disease before the 12-year study began was excluded, and the researchers controlled for age, sex, marital status, income and other factors. Owning a dog was associated with a 20 percent lower risk of all-cause death and a 23 percent lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease. The study is in Scientific Reports.

The effect was stronger with certain breeds, particularly pointers and retrievers. The senior author, Tove Fall, an epidemiologist at Uppsala University, suggested that this may reflect different kinds of owners: picture the owner of a Labrador retriever, and then one who has a Pomeranian.

“Owning a dog is good motivation to get out and exercise and may provide some social support,” Dr. Fall said. But the study does not prove cause and effect, and in any case, “not everyone is up to owning a dog. Don’t give a dog to your grandmother in the hope that she’ll live longer.”",REAL
Young Again: How One Cell Turns Back Time,"Right before an egg is fertilized, it is swept clean of deformed proteins in a dramatic burst of housecleaning.

The researchers discovered this process by studying a tiny worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. The worm has been a favorite of biologists for 50 years because its inner workings are much the same as our own.

C. elegans relies on many of the same genes that we do to control the division of cells, for example, and to program faulty cells to commit suicide.

In 1993, Dr. Kenyon discovered that a gene called daf-2 greatly influenced the life span of these worms. Shutting down the gene more than doubled the worm’s lifetime from 18 days to 42 days.

That finding, which Dr. Kenyon made while a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, led to the discovery of an entire network of genes involved in repairing cells, allowing animals to live longer. Humans depend on similar genes to repair our cells, too.

“Cynthia really pioneered the field of aging and rejuvenation using C. elegans,” said Irina M. Conboy, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley.

The longest-lived mutant worms savored only an extra few weeks of life, but their germlines kept rolling along from one generation to the next.

Dr. Kenyon’s curiosity about the germline’s secrets was sharpened in 2010 by a study by Jérôme Goudeau and Hugo Aguilaniu, two biologists then at the University of Lyon in France. (Dr. Goudeau now works at Calico.) They took a close look at the proteins in the worm’s egg-like cells, called oocytes.

Most C. elegans are hermaphrodites, producing both eggs and sperm. As the eggs mature, they travel down a tube, at the end of which they encounter sperm.

Dr. Goudeau and Dr. Aguilaniu discovered that a worm’s eggs carry a surprisingly heavy burden of damaged proteins, even more than in the surrounding cells. But in eggs that were nearing the worm’s sperm, the researchers found far less damage.

Dr. Goudeau and Dr. Aguilaniu then ran the same experiment with a twist. They mutated a gene in the worms, leaving them unable to make sperm. The eggs in these entirely “female” worms were filled with damaged proteins and did not get repaired.

These experiments raised the possibility that the sperm were sending out a signal that somehow prompted the eggs to rid themselves of damaged proteins. In 2013, Dr. Kenyon and Dr. Bohnert set out to test that possibility. (They moved the research to Calico in 2015.)

Clumping proteins are involved in many diseases of old age, such as Alzheimer’s. Dr. Kenyon and Dr. Bohnert set up an experiment using a special strain of worms in which clumping proteins glowed.

In hermaphrodite worms, they discovered, immature eggs were loaded with protein clumps, while the ones close to the sperm had none. The researchers then created mutant “female” worms and observed that their eggs all became littered with protein clumps.

When Dr. Bohnert let them mate with males, however, the clumps disappeared from the eggs. “In thirty minutes you typically see them cleared out,” he said.

Dr. Bohnert and Dr. Kenyon then carried out additional studies, such as looking for other mutant worms that could not clear out protein clumps even though they could make sperm. Combining these findings, the researchers worked out the chain of events by which the eggs rejuvenate themselves.

It begins with a chemical signal released by the sperm, which triggers drastic changes in the egg. The protein clumps within the egg “start to dance around,” said Dr. Bohnert.

The clumps come into contact with little bubbles called lysosomes, which extend fingerlike projections that pull the clumps inside. The sperm signal causes the lysosomes to become acidic. That change switches on the enzymes inside the lysosomes, allowing them to swiftly shred the clumps.

“It’s a huge, coordinated shift,” said Dr. Bohnert.

Dr. Bohnert and Dr. Kenyon hypothesize that the worms normally keep their eggs in a dormant state. The eggs accumulate a lot of damage, but make little effort to repair it.

Only in the last minutes before fertilization do they destroy protein clumps and damaged proteins, so that their offspring won’t inherit that burden. The detritus may even be recycled, Dr. Kenyon speculated, into building blocks needed to make the new proteins that are required to develop an embryo.

“Once the oocyte hears the knocks on the door, then it can just clean it all out and even use it as food, maybe,” she said.

If her previous research is any guide, then we may very likely use the same strategy in human reproduction. “The hypothesis is that it’s not just a worm thing,” Dr. Kenyon said.

That remains to be seen. In their new paper, Dr. Kenyon and Dr. Bohnert reported that they had tested this hypothesis on frogs, which are much more closely related to humans than is C. elegans.

The scientists exposed frog eggs to a hormone that signals them to mature. The lysosomes in the frog eggs became acidic, just as happens in worms.

“I think it’s a way to guarantee that you clean the slate for the next generation,” said Dr. Bohnert.

The germline may not be the only place where cells restore themselves in this way.

Throughout our lives, we maintain a supply of stem cells that can rejuvenate our skin, guts and brains. It may be that stem cells also use lysosomes to eradicate damaged proteins.

“That would have huge implications,” Dr. Conboy said. It might be possible, for example, to treat diseases by giving aging tissues a signal to clean house.

Calico, founded by Google in 2013, is searching for drugs to counter aging. But Dr. Kenyon doesn’t see new medicine emerging from this research anytime soon.

“We didn’t patent anything from it,” she said. “I would think you’d need to know a lot more before you know exactly what to do. This is still the very early stage.”",REAL
