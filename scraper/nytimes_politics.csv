Senate Passes Sweeping Republican Tax Overhaul Bill,"Early on Saturday morning, Vice President Mike Pence provided a tiebreaking vote to pass an amendment offered by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, that would allow people to use up to $10,000 a year from tax-advantaged 529 savings accounts to fund tuition at private and religious K-12 schools or certain educational expenses for home-schooled students. Right now, such accounts can only be used to pay for higher education.

The bill’s approval, coming on the heels of the House passing its own tax bill last month, is the first significant legislative victory for the Republican Party since it assumed control of the House, Senate and White House in 2017. The lightening-fast trajectory of the bill and the ability to overcome — or ignore — objections that have bedeviled previous attempts to revamp the tax code, highlights the pressure Republican leaders faced to notch a victory after several failed legislative efforts this year.

Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader and Kentucky Republican, called it “a great day for the country.”

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a statement that with Senate approval “we will move quickly to a conference committee so we can get a final bill to President Trump’s desk.”

Republicans have pitched the bill as a middle-class tax cut and the overhaul is intended to immediately cut taxes for about 70 percent of middle-class families. But it would raise them on millions of others, since the Senate plan eliminates some tax breaks like the deduction for state and local income taxes and phases out the individual tax cuts at the end of 2025.

Businesses fare far better, with the corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent from 35 percent and made permanent. It also offers a large tax break for the owners of small businesses and other companies that are not organized as traditional corporations, a provision that was sweetened in a last-minute deal to bring two wavering senators on board.

Democrats opposed the tax bill as a bloc, saying it was meant to help the wealthy and not the middle class. With the Senate split 52 to 48, Republicans barely had votes to spare. But the bill’s passage was made possible by a near-complete Republican embrace of the idea that about $1.5 trillion of tax cuts will pay for themselves, by producing enough economic growth and additional federal revenue to offset their costs to the Treasury.

That belief was contradicted by several studies, including one from Congress’s official economic scorekeeper, which Republicans dismissed as overly pessimistic.

Mr. McConnell waved off any deficit concerns, saying “I’m totally confident this is a revenue neutral bill. Actually a revenue producer.”

The House and Senate will now work quickly to resolve the differences between their bills and deliver a plan to President Trump’s desk, with the aim of delivery by Christmas.

Congressional leaders raced the bill through the House and the Senate in a month, with a crush of changes coming in the 11th hour as Senate leadership worked to address the concerns of a few lawmakers whose support was critical to passage. Several changes were included to satisfy Ms. Collins, including a provision that will allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes paid and allowing lower-income individuals to claim the medical expense deduction.

In the late afternoon, Ms. Collins announced her support for the bill, citing those changes as well as a promise from Mr. McConnell that he would support two bipartisan bills meant to help stabilize individual insurance markets under the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Collins had expressed concern about a provision in the tax bill to repeal the act’s mandate that most Americans have insurance or pay a penalty.

Lawmakers also included a more generous tax break for companies organized as pass-through entities, a provision needed to win the support of Mr. Johnson and Senator Steve Daines of Montana.

And, in a bid to get Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona on board, leaders agreed to work on providing “fair and permanent protections” for the beneficiaries of an Obama-era effort that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, Mr. Flake said.

“There are no ironclad commitments — at this date we’re going have a bill — but I am confident,” Mr. Flake said. “I’ve always been convinced on DACA that the president’s instincts are better than the advice he’s getting.”

Mr. Flake, an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, said he had spoken with Vice President Mike Pence about the issue. “We had a long conversation last night and today, and he committed to start working with me on this,” Mr. Flake said.

Mr. Flake also said he had won changes in a provision, which expires after five years, to allow companies to immediately deduct new investment expenses, which he called a “gimmick.”

The bill would also open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling, putting environmental activists on the brink of defeat in what has been a decades-long battle. Opening the wildlife refuge to energy exploration has been a goal of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska.

Several of the changes, most notably the property tax break and the additional deduction for pass-through businesses, combined to add several hundred billion dollars to the cost of the bill. To offset them, party leaders scaled back some planned tax cuts and increased a new tax on assets held overseas by American multinational companies.

Most notably, they decided to maintain the alternative minimum tax on corporations and to trim the effects of the alternative minimum tax for high-earning individuals. Originally, the bill would have eliminated both those taxes entirely.

None of those changes were likely to improve the fiscal cost of the bill — in defiance of the concerns that several senators had raised about adding to future deficits.

Chief among those worried about the deficit was Mr. Corker, whose fears over the bill’s effect on the federal budget deficit created last-minute complications for Republican leaders on Thursday when he demanded changes to the bill.

Mr. Corker had pushed to scale back the tax cuts after a report from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation that projected the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits over a decade, even after accounting for economic growth.

Republicans said Mr. Corker had angered colleagues and overplayed his hand in the wake of that analysis. Mr. Corker was alarmed by the projections. But many of his colleagues greeted them with distrust, both because they expected tax cuts to generate more robust economic growth than the forecasters projected and because they felt burned by unflattering analyses of their health care proposals issued this year by the Congressional Budget Office.

The joint committee sprinted to complete its analysis of the Senate bill before the vote, having failed to complete one of the House version before it was passed two weeks after its introduction. Still, Republicans wondered why the analysis arrived on Thursday, the day the Senate was originally scheduled to vote, a leadership aide said on Friday.

The timing and the scoring of the analysis generated a lot of suspicion, the aide said.

Mr. Corker pointed to the analysis to push for rolling back of some of the tax cuts after several years, to reduce the bill’s cost, but many of his colleagues revolted over that idea. Republican leaders decided on Thursday night to drop efforts to appease Mr. Corker and instead sweeten their offer to Mr. Daines and Mr. Johnson, by offering to allow pass-through owners to deduct 23 percent of their business income, up from 17.4 percent in the original bill.

Previously, the leaders had offered a deduction of 20 percent. The increase to 23 was enough to get both men on board.

“After weeks of fighting for Main Street businesses including Montana’s farmers and ranchers, I’ve decided to support the Senate tax cut bill, which provides significant tax relief for Main Street businesses,” Mr. Daines said in a statement Friday morning.

Mr. Johnson followed with his own pledge of support.

“I wanted more,” he said, “but I’m a reasonable human being.”

Mr. Johnson had helped give a scare to Republican leaders on Thursday, as he, Mr. Corker and Mr. Flake withheld their votes as Republicans were trying to kill a Democratic motion to relegate the bill back to a Senate panel.

“Senator Corker called me and said, ‘Why shouldn’t we vote for that one?’” Mr. Johnson recalled on Friday.

“There’s always parliamentary maneuvers, right?” he said. “So we didn’t vote.”

Recounting how the vote played out, Mr. Johnson said, “I was just kind of biding my time.” Eventually, he said, a Republican colleague, Rob Portman of Ohio, came over to see what could be done.

The deal to sweeten the tax break for pass-through businesses came together later that night, as Mr. Johnson, Mr. Daines and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina met with Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, in his Capitol office to make a case to Senate leadership.

“There’s a lot of competing interests,” Mr. Johnson said, likening the bill to a Rubik’s Cube.

“I guess they put that Rubik’s Cube together,” he added.

While Ms. Collins publicly remained undecided on the bill over the past week, Republican leaders were confident they would bring her on board. She made her demands clear early in the process, and she actively negotiated with the leadership until the day of the vote.

Democrats warned on Friday that Republicans were making a political mistake with a bill that would increase taxes on some middle-class families.

“It’ll be a dramatic turning point in a downward spiral for the Republicans,” Mr. Schumer said.",REAL
"A Hasty, Hand-Scribbled Tax Bill Sets Off an Outcry","Photo

WASHINGTON — By midafternoon on Friday, Republicans had the votes to pass their tax bill in the Senate. What they did not have was a bill.

The legislation, covering nearly 500 pages, finally surfaced well after the sun had set. It appeared first in the lobbying shops of K Street, which sent back copies to some Democrats in the Senate, who took to social media to protest being asked to vote in a matter of hours on a bill that had yet to be shared with them directly.

The drafts that leaked to journalists included changes scrawled in looping handwriting in the margins. Democrats posted screenshots and accompanying complaints. Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, called it “Washington D.C. at its worst” in a video in which he held up a page of the bill with the changes.

“This is unbelievable, we’re doing massive tax reform on an absolute incredible timeline,” he said. “This is going to affect everybody in this country.”

With Republicans intent on passing a bill along party lines, public protests have been Democrats’ only weapon throughout the lightning-fast progression of the bill over the last month. The minority party has no ability to stop the bill, because Republicans are employing a Senate tactic that allows them to bypass a Democratic filibuster. The first version of the tax plan was introduced in the House on Nov. 1 and approved two weeks later; the Senate is on course to match that pace.

That would be a compressed schedule in any event, but it was particularly so on Friday, as Republicans inserted several last-second amendments to secure majority support for their bill. Democrats could only scold and work up a frenzy on social media.

In a separate video, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, held up a stack of legislative text and tried to read the changes that the Republicans had made. She struggled to make sense of the garbled language and lamented that she could not possibly read the bill in the hour or so before the expected vote.",REAL
Michael Flynn Pleads Guilty to Lying to the F.B.I. and Will Cooperate With Russia Inquiry,"Mr. Flynn’s plea deal could deeply undercut the claims made in January by Mr. Trump and his aides that they were misled by Mr. Flynn about his discussion with Russians regarding sanctions imposed on Moscow by the Obama administration over the election interference. In fact, the documents say multiple members of the team coordinated the specifics of Mr. Flynn’s outreach to Russia and knew that the conversations were about sanctions.

Mr. Flynn’s agreement also provided new context for Mr. Trump’s efforts to get F.B.I. officials to back off their investigation of Mr. Flynn.

James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has said that the president asked him to shut down the investigation one day after Mr. Flynn was fired in February. “I hope you can let this go,” the president said, according to congressional testimony by Mr. Comey.

The information provided by Mr. Flynn, who promised to provide prosecutors with information on “any and all matters,” suggests one possible motivation for the president’s efforts to shut down the Flynn investigation: to avoid revealing the deep involvement of his top transition officials in Mr. Flynn’s discussions with Mr. Kislyak.

In May, the president fired Mr. Comey as well and said the Russia investigation was on his mind at the time. Mr. Mueller is investigating whether Mr. Trump’s firings of Mr. Comey or Mr. Flynn amount to obstruction of justice.

Mr. Trump made no public comments on Friday, though Mr. Flynn’s plea provided an awkward backdrop for a closed-door holiday reception for members of the press corps at the White House.

Ty Cobb, the president’s lawyer dealing with the Russia inquiry, played down the potential impact of Mr. Flynn’s deal, saying that Mr. Flynn served only briefly in the administration and had pleaded guilty to just a single count of lying to the F.B.I.

“Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn,” Mr. Cobb said in a statement.

But while the court documents released on Friday show no direct evidence of collusion with Russia, the special counsel’s filings so far paint a damning portrait of Mr. Trump’s associates. His former campaign chairman, two other campaign aides and his former national security adviser have now all been charged with felonies.

In a statement, Mr. Flynn, 58, denied “false accusations of ‘treason,’” but said that he had agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, who are examining whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russians during the election and whether anyone sought to cover it up.

“I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right,” Mr. Flynn said. “My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the special counsel’s office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.”

Friday’s 45-minute hearing in federal court in Washington was a humiliating moment for Mr. Flynn, a decorated Army general who had risen to lead the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired by Mr. Obama before joining the Trump campaign.

Dressed in a crisp gray suit, Mr. Flynn arrived at the courtroom with his wife, holding hands. They occasionally traded glances, and her legs trembled before prosecutors laid out their case that Mr. Flynn had repeatedly lied to investigators about his dealings with Russia and his lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government.

Mr. Flynn’s plea agreement requires his full cooperation. He agreed to take a polygraph and, if asked, to participate in covert law enforcement activities. Such undercover activities are unlikely, however, since the plea agreement was filed publicly.

Prosecutors said they would delay Mr. Flynn’s sentencing, a sign that their investigation was not over and that they had not exhausted Mr. Flynn’s cooperation. Lying to the F.B.I. carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, but court documents indicate Mr. Flynn faces a likely sentence of zero to six months in prison.

Because he pleaded guilty to lying, Mr. Flynn hurt his credibility as a witness if he ever offered evidence against someone else at trial. But Mr. Flynn’s cooperation could still be valuable in guiding Mr. Mueller’s understanding of the campaign’s contacts with Russia, even if he cannot directly implicate anyone in a crime.

According to prosecutors, on Dec. 22, Mr. Flynn discussed with Mr. Kislyak an upcoming United Nations Security Council vote on whether to condemn Israel’s building of settlements. At the time, the Obama administration was preparing to allow a Security Council vote on the matter.

Mr. Mueller’s investigators have learned through witnesses and documents that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel asked the Trump transition team to lobby other countries to help Israel, according to two people briefed on the inquiry. Investigators have learned that Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kushner took the lead in those efforts.

Mr. Mueller’s team has emails that show Mr. Flynn saying he would work to kill the vote, the people briefed on the matter said.

Mr. Flynn also spoke to Mr. Kislyak on Dec. 29, according to court documents, about the sanctions against Russia announced that day. He had consulted with Ms. McFarland about the matter. She was with other members of the team at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, the court documents revealed, “to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian ambassador about the U.S. sanctions.”

Mr. Flynn asked Mr. Kislyak that Moscow refrain from escalating the situation, and Mr. Kislyak said Russia “had chosen to moderate its response,” the documents said. The following day, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said Moscow would not retaliate against the United States for the sanctions.

American intelligence agencies had grown so concerned about Mr. Flynn’s communications with Mr. Kislyak and false accounts that he provided to Mr. Pence that he was interviewed by F.B.I. agents at the White House four days after the president was sworn into office. Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, warned the White House that its national security adviser might be compromised by the Russians.

Even before Mr. Trump said he would appoint Mr. Flynn to the post, questions swirled around his connections to foreign governments, particularly a dinner he was paid to attend in Moscow in 2015 when he sat at the same table as Mr. Putin.

Mr. Flynn had also formed a consulting group after he left the Obama administration that led to inquiries into questionable lobbying for foreign governments, including the Turkish government.

Investigators working for the special counsel have questioned witnesses about whether Mr. Flynn was secretly paid by Turkish officials during the campaign. After he left the White House, Mr. Flynn disclosed that the Turkish government had paid him more than a half-million dollars to represent its interests in a dispute with the United States.

Prosecutors did not charge Mr. Flynn with crimes related to his work with the Turkish government. But in documents, they made clear that they have evidence that Mr. Flynn “made materially false statements and omissions” in his federal filings about that lobbying work.

Mr. Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., was intimately involved with his father’s undisclosed lobbying efforts. The son has not been charged with a crime and it is not clear whether his possible legal exposure put extra pressure on his father to plead guilty. Barry Coburn, a lawyer for Mr. Flynn Jr., declined to comment.",REAL
Flynn’s Guilty Plea Looms Over a White House on the Verge of a Tax Cut Success,"Still, former Representative Mickey Edwards, Republican of Oklahoma, said Mr. Trump’s unconventional political appeal might yet minimize the consequences that other presidents might have endured.

“In any normal White House, and with any normal basis for presidential support, the Flynn story would be crippling,” he said. “This president’s support base is small but apparently unshakable, and with Republicans in Congress showing a frightening unwillingness to hold this president to account, I don’t expect this development to change the behavior of either Congress or the president.”

Mr. Flynn was the highest-ranking current or former White House official to be convicted of a crime connected to his time in office since two national security advisers to President Ronald Reagan — John M. Poindexter and Robert McFarlane — were found guilty during the Iran-contra scandal. Mr. Poindexter’s conviction was later reversed on appeal and Mr. McFarlane was pardoned by President George H. W. Bush.

Almost everyone in Washington, it seemed, had expected an indictment of Mr. Flynn, and the possibility that he was cooperating with prosecutors was telegraphed last week with the news that his defense lawyers had cut off contact with Mr. Trump’s lawyers.

And yet the announcement on Friday still hit the White House like a thunderclap. The president’s legal team had no advance warning. His chief of staff, John F. Kelly, learned about it from television. He called Mr. Trump, who was still in the residence part of the White House, to let him know he would be hearing about a Flynn plea deal soon. The president’s reaction, according to one adviser, was that Mr. Flynn “is in a lot of trouble.”

Whether that fear turned into something more immediate about himself or his family, Mr. Trump did not vocalize it, the adviser said. His staff urged him to stay off Twitter, and for the most part, he complied. The president had a cordial, if at times awkward, lunch with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, and then used Twitter to deny any plans to fire him. In the afternoon, Mr. Trump stopped by a White House Christmas party for reporters but stayed less than five minutes.

The president’s optimistic outlook last weekend was fueled by his White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, who has consistently assured him that the investigation by Mr. Mueller would most likely conclude by the end of the year. Mr. Cobb has successfully persuaded Mr. Trump for the most part to curb his combative instincts and work in the parameters of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, turning over requested documents and avoiding incendiary attacks on the prosecutor.

But Mr. Trump has been slipping free of Mr. Kelly’s restrictions for several weeks, speaking with old friends by telephone during his Mar-a-Lago trip and becoming incensed all over again about the Russia inquiry. Friends said he was particularly excitable in his phone calls in the days leading up to Mr. Flynn’s guilty plea, a mood that seemed reflected by a week of lashing out on Twitter at various targets other than the investigators.

He has been so fitful that at one point during his stay in Florida, he told some club members that he was not fretting about whether Senate Republicans would pass his tax proposal because he had “a plan.” If the Senate failed to approve his tax cuts, Mr. Trump told them, he would refuse to sign a new short-term spending bill financing the government, forcing a partial shutdown.

Aides insist that Mr. Trump is not consumed with the Russia inquiry more than he has been at other times. Yet he has been leaning on Mr. Cobb, constantly summoning him to the residence and dialing another lawyer on his team, Jay Sekulow, for consultations, people briefed on the discussions said.

The White House made a point of playing down any appearance of concern on Friday. A statement issued by Mr. Cobb diminished Mr. Flynn’s importance by noting that he served as national security adviser for only 25 days before being fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and others about the details of his conversation with a Russian ambassador.

The statement also sought to distance the president from his former aide by calling Mr. Flynn a “former Obama administration official,” which was not exactly the full story. During President Barack Obama’s administration, Mr. Flynn was an active-duty lieutenant general who was promoted to direct the Defense Intelligence Agency, but he was not a political associate of the president, and Mr. Obama fired him.

Mr. Flynn became one of Mr. Trump’s most visible and vocal supporters during the presidential campaign last year, giving a memorable stem-winding speech at the Republican National Committee in which he assailed the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and led the crowd in chants of “Lock her up.” The irony of that phrase was lost on no one on Friday.

Mr. Trump reportedly tried to protect Mr. Flynn from this day. James B. Comey testified before Congress in June that when he was F.B.I. director, Mr. Trump asked him to “see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Mr. Trump, who fired Mr. Comey, later disputed that account.

Mr. Comey’s firing led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Not only was the investigation into Mr. Flynn not let go, it now poses an unknown potential threat to Mr. Trump’s White House.

Mr. Comey offered his own take on the turn of events on Friday with an Instagram post quoting Amos 5:24, “But let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.”",REAL
"Trump to Keep Embassy in Tel Aviv, but Recognize Jerusalem as Capital","With another deadline looming next Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to sign an order keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv. But he will couple that with a statement that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital — something that no president, Republican or Democrat, has done since the state of Israel was established in 1948.

Given the extreme sensitivities surrounding Jerusalem, Middle East experts said Mr. Trump’s plan was fraught with risk. Even after extensive consultations with Arab leaders, which the White House has done, such a move could provoke volatile reactions.

“The devil is in the details of what they announce,” said Martin S. Indyk, who served as American ambassador to Israel under President Bill Clinton. “If this is not framed properly, far from resolving this issue, it will land the administration in even hotter water.”

Among the questions, Mr. Indyk said, are whether Mr. Trump will restrict recognition to West Jerusalem, whether he will mention Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem and how he will deal with Jerusalem’s status as a holy city — a factor that could determine whether Saudi Arabia supports or abandons his peace project.

News of Mr. Trump’s decision came amid fresh disclosures about how, even before he took office, he worked closely with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to scuttle a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israel’s settlement policy — subverting then-President Barack Obama, who had decided to allow a vote to go ahead.

Documents filed in connection with the guilty plea of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, revealed that on Dec. 22, 2016, a “very senior member” of Mr. Trump’s transition team instructed Mr. Flynn to contact foreign officials, including from Russia, “to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.”

Lawyers identified the senior transition official as Mr. Kushner. Russia rebuffed Mr. Flynn’s request and voted for the resolution, which passed after the United States abstained.

Mr. Trump has kept up his close relations with Mr. Netanyahu, though that may be tested if, as expected, the White House tries to jump-start peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians early next year.

While Mr. Netanyahu supports the decision to move the American Embassy, Israeli officials have not pushed the issue in recent months. Other leaders in the region, like King Abdullah II of Jordan, remain deeply opposed to it.

But Mr. Trump was under immense pressure from pro-Israel and evangelical supporters and is likely to repeat past assertions that it is not a matter of if, but when, the embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. He is also being pressed to declare that next week’s waiver will be his last — effectively promising to devise a plan by mid-2018 to begin relocating the embassy.

Declaring Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital would not itself mark a change in American law. In 1995, Mr. Clinton signed a statute declaring, “Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital of the State of Israel.” But administrations have been allowed to decide, as a matter of policy, whether to recognize it as the capital, and none have done so.

That law requires the embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, unless the president issues a waiver finding that doing so would be against national security interests of the United States. American presidents have done so every six months since then to avoid prejudging the outcome of — and therefore hampering — an eventual resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to change course. At the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March 2016, he said he would “move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.”

But he signed a waiver on June 1, and officials said Mr. Adelson was among the supporters who were deeply disappointed by the president’s decision.

Among those pressing hardest for moving the embassy, said people close to the deliberations, was Vice President Mike Pence, who has been a conduit for Mr. Trump to religious conservatives. In a speech in New York on Tuesday, he said Mr. Trump was “actively considering when and how to move the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.”

In the short run, the decision could complicate plans for Mr. Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump’s special envoy, to restart peace negotiations. Palestinian officials have warned that Mr. Trump is “playing with fire.”

“If you’re trying to be creative by saying we’re recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, you’d better qualify it,” said Dennis B. Ross, a longtime Middle East peace negotiator. “If you don’t qualify it, that means you’ve just accepted the Israeli position on the final status of Jerusalem, which means you’ve lost the Arabs.”",REAL
"Debt Concerns, Once a Core Republican Tenet, Take a Back Seat to Tax Cuts","All but one Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, appeared set to vote for the bill on Friday.

The House and the Senate would still have to reach final agreement on the details, and Mr. Trump would have to sign his name, but the Republican Party now stands on the verge of driving up the national debt after spending much of the last decade promising rectitude and criticizing Democrats for profligacy.

The legislation reads “as if it were developed for a country whose debt problems have been solved, when in reality debt is the highest it has ever been other than around World War II,” declared the co-chairmen of a bipartisan commission created in 2010 to propose measures for reducing the debt.

Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, formerly President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, said the current crop of Republicans are avoiding “nearly all the hard choices.”

Mr. McConnell has a well-documented history of fretting about the debt.

“We’d like to do something about the nation’s biggest problem, spending and debt, which of course is the reason for this economic malaise,” he said in 2011. He added that Republicans could not address the problem because they did not control the White House or Senate.

Last year, with Republicans in control of the House and the Senate and about to claim the White House, he reiterated his distaste for debt. “I think this level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,” Mr. McConnell said. “My preference on tax reform is that it be revenue neutral.”

He continued in words that now seem particularly striking. “What I hope we will clearly avoid, and I’m confident we will, is a trillion-dollar stimulus,” he said. “Take you back to 2009. We borrowed $1 trillion and nobody could find that it did much of anything. So we need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly.”

This week, the congressional scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, reported that the Senate’s tax plan is, in fact, a stimulus plan that costs $1 trillion — the amount it would add to the debt over the next decade after accounting for its significant economic benefits.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who shepherded the House’s version of the tax bill — which also would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade — has assiduously cultivated a reputation for concern about the federal debt.

In 2011 he released “The Path to Prosperity,” a budget plan proposing large spending cuts to balance the books. He said fiscal discipline was unpopular but necessary.

“What I do know is I can’t look my kids and my constituents in the eyes with my conscience being clear and not know that I didn’t do everything I could to try and fix this problem,” Mr. Ryan said in a 2011 interview with CNBC.

In 2013, he said the debt “will weigh down our country like an anchor.”

At the time, the federal debt held by investors equaled 72 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. The Republican tax plan could push that to 85 percent by 2021, Goldman Sachs estimated Wednesday, which would be the highest debt ratio since the immediate aftermath of World War II.

Republicans are gambling that voters would rather have tax cuts now and worry about debt later. That is certainly the position of the corporate sector, which has abandoned pious expressions of concern about Washington’s extravagance in favor of earnest pleas for tax relief.

“Passing tax reform is the single most important thing that Congress can do to make American companies more competitive,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said last month.

A number of prominent Republicans have defiantly insisted that economic forecasters are wrong about the likely cost of the tax cuts. They say the legislation will cause a surge of economic growth that will allow the government to collect just as much money at lower tax rates.

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the analysis of the economists Congress employs for that purpose, using techniques he has endorsed, as “curious.”

The Trump administration, without offering evidence, continues to insist the federal debt will not rise.

Republicans also have long distinguished between deficits caused by spending increases and deficits caused by tax cuts. They argue that tax cuts are good for the economy, and that the resulting problem of larger deficits should be addressed by reducing government spending.

“You also have to bring spending under control,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week. “And not discretionary spending. That isn’t the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.”

The tax cuts, however, would increase the scale of that challenge.

Politicians of both parties also have lost their fear of debt in recent decades. The federal debt has grown much larger than was considered wise or even possible, with few apparent consequences.

“Reagan proved that deficits don’t matter,” Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002. Many Republicans take the view that the George W. Bush administration’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 proved the same point.

But federal borrowing imposes real economic costs, not least the need to make interest payments. It also restricts the funding available to private-sector investors. And experts continue to warn that the United States is on an unsustainable trajectory, particularly because the government has promised benefits to an expanding population of older Americans that will further outstrip tax revenue.

“It’s the type of thing that should keep people awake at night,” Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman, told a congressional committee last week.

But in Washington, in 2017, such warnings are no longer in vogue.",REAL
Republicans Near a Big Win — but Will It Lift Them Politically?,"“This is about doing what we promised the American people,” said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the head of the Republican Senate campaign organization that will play a major role in selling this tax plan to voters in advance of midterm elections next November.

Republican leaders did not see much alternative to meeting the final demands of uncommitted Republican senators since they were under immense pressure to get a win — any win. They hastily added provisions to appease Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana and offered assurances to Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona on immigration policy to guarantee their votes.

Democrats conceded that approval of the legislation — a sweeping bill that will cut corporate taxes and double the standard deduction — will prevent the first year of the Trump administration from being a legislative failure. But they believe that Republicans have made a political blunder because the reconfiguration of the tax structure — particularly new limits on the ability to deduct state and local taxes — will produce a tax increase for some voters who will be very unhappy when they realize it.

That could cost Republicans one of their bedrock principles. To appease party contributors demanding action on taxes, they may give up their mantle as the party of “no new taxes.”

“Today may be the first day of a new Republican Party — one that raises taxes on the middle class,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “The one thing Republicans always promised the middle class is ‘we are not going to raise your taxes.’”

The tax debate came at a very unsettled time in Washington. As Republican lawmakers clustered on Friday behind closed doors in the Capitol in their final negotiations, Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, was at the federal courthouse just a short stretch down Constitution Avenue, pleading guilty to lying to the F.B.I. Accusations of sexual harassment are swirling around Capitol Hill. And lawmakers are still developing an endgame to finance the government after funding runs out next Friday.

Top Republicans were hoping that their success on the tax legislation after a difficult struggle would break through to the public and provide evidence to Americans that the Republican-controlled Congress could be effective. They say that the deep cuts in business taxes should spark an economic expansion that will benefit all Americans, though that argument has been disputed by economists and not reflected in past experience.

“This is a signature effort,” said Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, adding: “This is at least in our view the restoration of an American renaissance and economic opportunity, for kids, grandkids and everybody present.”

Party strategists note that the Senate tax bill also includes some other long-sought Republican goals such as opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to energy exploration and elimination of the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most people have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.

“Considering the conventional wisdom that surrounded this Congress eight weeks ago, this is nothing short of a complete and total 180,” said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who remains in close contact with him.

Democrats say that many voters already see the tax overhaul as heavily tilted toward the affluent, and they promise to drive that point home in the coming months.

“I am overwhelmingly hearing from people, what are the Republicans doing? Why are they pushing this big agenda that is going to put our country in trouble?” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a member of the Democratic leadership. “They all say it’s such a giveaway to the wealthy and are just really stunned that this is happening.”

Tax policy can be hard for voters to grasp, as former President Barack Obama learned early in his term. The economic recovery act that he signed into law in 2009 included a number of tax cuts; the biggest one was titled “Making Work Pay,” and it offered a tax credit of 6.2 percent of earned income, up to $400 for individuals and $800 for couples.

But Jason Furman, who advised Mr. Obama on economic policy and is now teaching at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the cut did not register in the American psyche.

“Our perception in the White House was that no one had any idea that we had cut their taxes,” he said.

Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, pointed to the strong Democratic showing — including a win in the governor’s race — in his state in November and said voters are going to be disappointed when they don’t see the benefits of the tax bill.

“In Virginia this past year, you had a Republican candidate that was running on a platform of tax cuts, and you had a Democratic candidate who was running on a platform of health care, and you saw the results,” Mr. Warner said.

But Republicans were frantic to do something big legislatively and a tax bill was the obvious policy area where they could come to agreement, even if it didn’t come very easily. The months ahead will determine whether the effort staved off a political debacle or contributed to one.",REAL

If collusion did indeed occur between the Trump campaign and Russia, then Mr. Flynn would be “pleading guilty to an espionage conspiracy,” not what Mr. McCarthy describes as a “process crime” — lying to the F.B.I.

However, Mr. Dreyfuss thinks the minimal charges against the president’s former national security adviser are a sign that Mr. Flynn is cooperating with Mr. Mueller and his team.

Who Gains From the Tax Plan? Economists Face Off,"Who Gains From the Tax Plan? Economists Face Off Republican leaders say their proposals will fuel investment and job creation. Critics say that the rich are the beneficiaries and that debt will weigh on growth. We asked two economists, one from each side, to make their cases.

There is no disagreement that changes to the tax code should promote economic growth, fuel job creation and increase incomes. The question is whether the Republican tax bills would accomplish those goals.

Several prominent conservative economists have argued that the proposals would do just that.

Many others across the ideological spectrum have challenged those conclusions, saying the plan would cause the nation’s debt to rise substantially faster than the economy. Deficit-financed tax cuts are widely believed to undermine growth.

There is also substantial disagreement about who would ultimately gain. Republican leaders argue that the substantial tax cuts for business would eventually result in wage increases. Critics counter that there is little historical evidence for that claim.

The New York Times invited two economists to offer their views in an email exchange on the plan’s economic merits and drawbacks. They are Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum, and Kimberly A. Clausing, an economist and tax expert who teaches at Reed College. Their responses were condensed and edited.

Growth

How will these tax proposals affect the economy?

Douglas Holtz-Eakin

The economic logic is straightforward and time tested. Better incentives — like lower tax rates, being able to write off investments, taxation only on earnings in the United States — will encourage innovation, investment, hiring and pay raises. These incentives increase the accumulation of capital, whether in physical equipment or intellectual know-how. This capital deepening — having more and better capital for each worker — reverses recent trends and raises productivity growth. More rapid productivity growth, in turn, raises the real wages of the middle class and restores upward mobility to a stagnant labor market.

Kimberly A. Clausing

There is nothing wrong with the idea that reducing a tax on capital will spur investment, which should increase worker productivity and, eventually, wages. But these models ignore important features of the real world, the tax code and the proposed tax law changes. First, the current tax system already encourages debt-financed investment, but that incentive actually diminishes under the proposed changes. Second, we are already living in a world awash in capital; a shortage of capital supply is not the problem holding back investment. Companies have historically high levels of after-tax profits. Why do we think giving an even larger windfall to shareholders will suddenly fuel investment? For companies to seek new investment, they need a healthy middle class. Perhaps that is why so few C.E.O. hands went up at a recent event when asked if they would use tax cuts to increase investment; few companies plan new investments in response.

BUDGET

What will be the impact on the deficit?

Ms. Clausing

The bills’ backers conveniently assume away the deficits that finance these tax cuts; such deficits are likely to either raise interest rates or increase borrowing from foreigners (such that more of the country’s income flows abroad in the future), or do both. Even estimates accounting for growth effects, by nonpartisan entities such as the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center, find that the bills increase deficits by $1 trillion to $1.25 trillion over 10 years. Those factors will be a drag on the growth of American living standards. While the backers of the bill emphasize its supply-side benefits, the growth effects of these tax bills are being vastly oversold. Future taxpayers will be left with both increased income inequality and higher debt burdens. By 2027, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, 84 percent of households will face either a tax increase or a tax cut that is smaller than $100. This will be small consolation for the future taxes needed to pay off debt.

Mr. Holtz-Eakin

A fair concern has been raised over the need for additional federal borrowing as a result of the proposed reform. Certainly the level and trajectory of the federal debt are a troubling issue, and a revenue-neutral approach would have been preferable. But it is important to get the right order of magnitude of any impact. Of the additional $1.5 trillion of additional deficits permitted by the reconciliation rules, roughly $500 billion will occur in any event, either as part of the reform or when expiring tax provisions get extended. Of the remaining $1 trillion, somewhere between $400 billion and $600 billion will be offset by additional growth. That means the Treasury will need to finance another $40 billion to $60 billion more each year. This is a drop in the bucket of the Treasury market, with inconsequential implications for the overall level of interest rates.

MULTINATIONALS

Is it worth a tax break to bring home profits booked overseas?

American businesses have booked roughly $3 trillion overseas to avoid paying United States taxes. Under the Republican plan, they would get a tax break worth about $500 billion in return for bringing the money home. Republicans argue that the money would be used to create jobs. Critics say the proposal would reward companies for tax-avoidance strategies without — based on past cases — an economic dividend.

Mr. Holtz-Eakin

The bill would stipulate that on a certain date every dollar of overseas earnings will be deemed to have been repatriated and corporations will owe their respective tax. At that point, firms face the real economic choice — bring the money back or not — not influenced by taxes . This is very different from past repatriation holidays and should be expected to have much better results. The same pro-growth incentives that influence domestic investors will apply to the overseas earnings.

Ms. Clausing

There is simply no economic rationale for a windfall to shareholders based on their prior tax avoidance, and there is no economic evidence that such windfalls promote United States investment or job creation.

WAGES

Can Americans expect to see benefits in their paychecks?

Mr. Holtz-Eakin

Faster productivity growth will translate into more compensation — wages and benefits — for workers. This is a tight historical relationship that has somehow recently become controversial, but there is research that debunks claims to the contrary.

Ms. Clausing

These tax cuts are unlikely to spur large increases in wages; careful cross-country evidence fails to find benefits to wages from corporate tax cuts. If we truly wanted to help the middle class, we would focus on its needs directly, by providing it with the lion’s share of any net tax cuts, and by ensuring that the government has the revenue needed for important infrastructure, education and health care needs as well as the flexibility to respond to the next recession.

PROSPERITY

This bill has been promoted as a boon for the middle class. Does it fulfill that promise?

Mr. Holtz-Eakin

Capital accumulation, productivity growth and living better: That is the case for tax reform. It would be an easier political sale if there were a straight line from the policy to the prosperity (which is why the left prefers programs that write checks). But the logic is sound, the evidence conclusive and the case for tax reform helping the middle class impeccable.

Ms. Clausing

This tax bill is not about workers. It is about giving shareholders and businesses lower taxes and merely hoping benefits will trickle down. Instead, give workers any tax cuts, and rely on the strength of the middle class to bubble up, strengthening American business. Sound tax reform should not lose revenue, and it should not give the vast majority of benefits to those at the top.

Republicans dispute a report that the bill would raise taxes on the poor. The disagreement is related to a plan to remove the Obamacare requirement to purchase health insurance.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the insurance mandate would result in nearly 13 million fewer people with insurance. If people choose to go without insurance, the government would no longer need to pay billions of dollars to subsidize their plans, and Republicans are counting on those savings to help pay for the tax cuts. But it’s not clear how much money would actually be saved.

Former N.S.A. Employee Pleads Guilty to Taking Classified Information,"Prosecutors said that from 2010 until March 2015, Mr. Pho began removing classified documents and writings. He kept those materials, some in digital form, at his home in Maryland, according to prosecutors.

It appears he was charged in March 2015.

Mr. Pho is one of three N.S.A. workers to be charged in the past two years with mishandling classified information, a dismal record for an agency that is responsible for some of the government’s most carefully guarded secrets.

The leaks have come to light as investigators scramble to trace the source of an even worse breach of N.S.A. security: the public release of the agency’s hacking tools by a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. Some of those tools have been subsequently used for “ransomware” attacks that shut down or disrupted businesses, hospitals, railways and other enterprises around the world this year.

Government officials, who would speak of the classified details of the case only on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Pho took the classified documents home to help him rewrite his resume. But he had installed on his home computer antivirus software made by Kaspersky Lab, a top Russian software company, and Russian hackers are believed to have exploited the software to steal the documents, the officials said.

It is not clear whether anyone at Kaspersky Lab was aware of the document theft. The company has acknowledged finding N.S.A. hacking software on a customer’s computer and removing it, but says the material was subsequently destroyed. It has denied that it works with Russian intelligence.

The sensitivity of the case was evident on Friday, when one courtroom official described the charges against Mr. Pho as “super-sealed” before the hearing. The aggressive hacking of American targets by the Russian government, including the Democratic National Committee during last year’s election campaign, is a high-priority concern for the United States, and forensic information from Mr. Pho’s computer might provide useful clues.

In addition to Mr. Pho, an N.S.A. contractor, Harold T. Martin III, was arrested last year after F.B.I. agents found some 50 terabytes of data and documents that he had taken from the N.S.A. and other agencies over 20 years. The material was stuffed into a garden shed and car, among other places, and investigators have considered the possibility that the Shadow Brokers might have obtained the hacking tools from Mr. Martin, who had also worked at one point for agency’s Tailored Access Operations.

What Michael Flynn’s Guilty Plea Means in Mueller’s Russia Inquiry,"Talking sanctions with the Russian ambassador

False Statements Regarding FLYNN’s Request to the Russian Ambassador that Russia Refrain from Escalating the Situation in Response to U.S. Sanctions against Russia 3. On or about January 24, 2017, FLYNN agreed to be interviewed by agents from the FBI (“January 24 voluntary interview”). During the interview, FLYNN falsely stated that he did not ask Russia’s Ambassador to the United States (“Russian Ambassador”) to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia. FLYNN also falsely stated that he did not remember a follow-up conversation in which the Russian Ambassador stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of FLYNN’s request.

Mr. Flynn has now admitted that he lied when he told the F.B.I. that he had not discussed sanctions with Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, during the transition period. In fact, as Mr. Flynn has now acknowledged, after outgoing President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Dec. 28 imposing the sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its election interference, Mr. Flynn — at the request of an unnamed transition official — asked Mr. Kislyak for Russia to consider reacting with restraint.

Their conversations about sanctions have been well documented, and helped catalyze the chain of events that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. On Dec. 30, for example, after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced that his country would not retaliate at that time for the sanctions, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart!” On Jan. 15, Vice President-elect Mike Pence publicly denied that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak.

But soon after the F.B.I. interview in which Mr. Flynn falsely said the same thing, Sally Q. Yates, an Obama-era holdover serving as acting attorney general, warned the Trump White House that Russia could blackmail Mr. Flynn over having lied. Mr. Trump soon fired Ms. Yates over an unrelated matter, but did not act against Mr. Flynn until The Washington Post reported nearly two weeks later that intelligence officials knew that Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador had talked about sanctions, leaving Mr. Kislyak with the impression that the Trump administration would revisit the issue after taking office. Mr. Trump then fired Mr. Flynn, ostensibly for having misled Mr. Pence.

Mr. Trump later pressured James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to go easy on Mr. Flynn, according to Mr. Comey, before eventually firing him over his handling of the Russia investigation — a step that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller as special counsel.

Asking Russia to thwart U.S. policy at the U.N.

During the January 24 voluntary interview, FLYNN made additional false statements about calls he made to Russia and several other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically FLYNN falsely stated that he only asked the countries’ positions on the vote, and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. FLYNN also falsely stated that the Russian Ambassador never described to him Russia’s response to FL YNN’s request regarding the resolution.

Mr. Flynn has also admitted lying to the F.B.I. about asking Russia and several other countries for help in thwarting an Obama administration foreign policy decision to permit the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israel for building settlements in Palestinian territory. Russia nevertheless declined to delay or veto the measure, which the Security Council passed despite lobbying by Israel and the objections from the Trump transition team.

Some commentators have raised the question of whether such efforts by Mr. Flynn and the Trump transition team to lobby foreign governments in ways that conflicted with the official policy of the United States under the Obama administration before they took power were a violation of the Logan Act. That is a 1799 law that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments. But this statute has raised constitutional concerns and is generally considered a dead letter, meaning it remains on the books but is defunct.

Where will Mueller go next?

On or about December 22, 2016, a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team directed FLYNN to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.

On or about December 29, 2016, FLYNN called a senior official of the Presidential Transition Team (“PTT official”), who was with other senior members of the Presidential Transition Team at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. Sanctions.

In trying to figure out what happened with Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr. Mueller appears to be following a strategy of starting at the fringes and moving inward, pressuring people to cooperate. Mr. Flynn may, of course, have already given information to Mr. Mueller’s team that is not mentioned in these court filings. But one question raised by the documents is who the unnamed people are with whom he spoke about these matters — and what those people told federal investigators.

For example, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and close adviser, reportedly took the lead for the transition team on the United Nations Security Council resolution about Israel. Earlier this month, Mr. Mueller’s investigators interviewed Mr. Kushner about Mr. Flynn’s interactions with the Russian ambassador.

"Taxpayers Paid $84,000 to End Sex Harassment Claim Against Texas Lawmaker","Mr. Farenthold’s statement Friday is sure to spark new calls to pass bipartisan legislation that would release the parties to Office of Compliance settlements from the mandatory nondisclosure agreements that come with them.

“While I 100 percent support more transparency with respect to claims against members of Congress, I can neither confirm nor deny that settlement involved my office as the Congressional Accountability Act prohibits me from answering that question,” Mr. Farenthold said.

Details of Mr. Farenthold’s relationship with Ms. Greene have been known for several years after Ms. Greene sued the lawmaker in 2014 alleging he had illegally fired her after she complained about mistreatment. Ms. Greene accused Mr. Farenthold and his chief of staff, Bob Haueter, of retaliating after she complained about a hostile work environment.

Besides harassment, Ms. Greene’s suit accused Mr. Farenthold of drinking “to excess” on numerous occasions and said that staff members who accompanied him to Capitol Hill functions were put on “redhead patrol” to keep him out of trouble.

Mr. Farenthold’s $84,000 is more than three times larger than the $27,000 settlement paid by Representative John Conyers Jr. to a former aide in 2015 out of his office funds, not the Office of Compliance. That settlement has yielded calls from both Ms. Pelosi and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for the Michigan Democrat to resign.

Mr. Farenthold on Friday reissued a statement released by his office during the lawsuit that said the agreement between the two parties included “strict confidentiality.”

“Defendant disagrees strongly with the Plaintiff’s allegations in the Complaint, and Congressman Farenthold adamantly denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing. Plaintiff similarly disagrees with the Defendant’s allegations in the Answer,” the statement said. “However, after it became clear that further litigating this case would come at great expense to all involved — including the taxpayers — the parties engaged in mediation with a court-appointed mediator.”

The same year Ms. Greene sued him, Mr. Farenthold announced that he would give up a sexually explicit domain name — blow-me.org — that he had held since 1999, when he was in the business of buying such names on speculation and selling them.

The Office of Compliance said it has paid six settlements since 2013. The other cases include settlements for $150,000 for alleged veteran status discrimination, $76,000 for age discrimination, $37,250 for alleged disability discrimination, $7,000 for alleged discrimination because of sex and religion, and $5,200 for alleged discrimination claims because of race, national origin, and military service.

Trump Rejects Reports That His Top Diplomat is Departing,"Mr. Trump had also sidestepped questions on Thursday about Mr. Tillerson’s future. “He’s here. Rex is here,” Mr. Trump said then, in an underwhelming display of support that did not challenge the reports of Mr. Tillerson’s pending departure.

By Friday morning, Mr. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department during a brief appearance with Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj of Libya that the reports were “laughable.” He then headed to the White House for two meetings with Mr. Trump, including a lunch with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis — one of Mr. Tillerson’s allies. The president tweeted after those meetings.

Despite his years as a reality-TV star who routinely issued the line, “You’re fired,” Mr. Trump has struggled with ousting his staff, even after he has chosen to do so. Two White House advisers said the president ultimately decided on Friday to bolster Mr. Tillerson with the tweet to avoid undermining his chief diplomat right before he heads overseas to work on a host of global crises.

Mr. Tillerson is leaving for Europe on Monday on a weeklong trip, when he will attend a NATO meeting in Brussels and then fly to Vienna for a discussion at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe about the yearslong unrest in Ukraine.

The two White House advisers insisted, however, that Mr. Tillerson is expected to leave sometime in January.

In the plan revealed on Thursday, Mr. Tillerson would be succeeded by Mike Pompeo, currently the C.I.A. director, who is more closely aligned with Mr. Trump on a series of important foreign policy matters. Mr. Tillerson’s refusal to resign despite his disagreements with Mr. Trump — and the president’s reported dislike for the diplomat — may have been the reason senior administration officials leaked Mr. Kelly’s plan this week to replace him.

Mr. Tillerson had previously and repeatedly denied reports of his impending departure, even going so far as to hold a news conference in October to say, “There’s never been a consideration in my mind to leave.”

The debate over Mr. Tillerson’s status is the latest outgrowth of a White House that has been beset by internal battles, high-level departures, indictments of two top former campaign officials and guilty pleas from a former national security adviser and a campaign adviser. All have contributed to a generalized sense of chaos that shows few signs of abating, even as the administration nears the completion of its first year in power.

Mr. Tillerson is a phlegmatic former chief executive of Exxon Mobil whose personal net worth is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. His continued service to a White House that so obviously wants him gone has led to something of a cottage industry of speculation in Washington about his reasons for remaining.

One theory, frequently repeated at the State Department, is that an early departure would cost Mr. Tillerson millions of dollars in taxes for assets he sold to take the diplomatic post. Tax experts have dismissed this notion.

After being nominated, Mr. Tillerson was granted a so-called Certificate of Divestiture that allowed him to sell off Exxon stock without having to immediately pay capital gains taxes on those holdings. Two lawyers involved in issuing these documents said that the federal law creating this process — which is intended to eliminate a disincentive to qualified individuals joining the government — has no provision to withdraw this benefit, assuming that Mr. Tillerson completed the sale of his stocks before he left his government job.

The ethics agreement that Mr. Tillerson signed in January, after he was nominated, indicated that he planned to complete the sale of his Exxon stock and other potentially problematic stock assets within 90 days of his confirmation. As long as Mr. Tillerson followed that plan, the timing of his resignation would have no impact on his tax liability, the lawyers said.

It is also believed that Mr. Tillerson has become so wedded to a State Department reorganization that he launched earlier this year that he will not leave until it is in place. That is expected to occur early next year.

Mr. Tillerson has said the reorganization is his highest priority. He intends to slash the State Department’s personnel by 8 percent and its budget by 31 percent. The cuts are needed, he has said many times, because many of the world’s conflicts will soon be resolved. This view is dismissed as naïve both within the State Department and the broader foreign policy community.

Mr. Tillerson has made clear he has little use for much of the day-to-day diplomacy conducted by his work force. Diplomats across the State Department spent much of Thursday and Friday checking their phones for news announcing Mr. Tillerson’s departure.

His personal press aide, R.C. Hammond, is expected to leave his post this month, according to three people in the department with direct knowledge of the situation and who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues.

Mr. Hammond denied he would be leaving soon.

“You are not so lucky,” Mr. Hammond wrote in an email. “You still get to work with me.”",REAL
Dueling Tax Plans: Here’s What the Senate and House Have to Resolve,"The Senate plan eliminates the so-called SALT deduction entirely, which could anger many upper-middle-class families and spook House members who have already objected to the more generous scaled-back version in their chamber.

But the Senate may well add that House property tax provision into its bill to satisfy Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has said that it must be done before she commits to the bill. By the end of the day, the Senate may add in the $10,000 property tax deduction, which would go a long way to assuaging House lawmakers as well.

Mortgage interest deduction

Republicans in the House would cap the deduction for mortgage interest debt at $500,000, down from the current cap of $1 million.

Senate Republicans have decided to leave the deduction alone. If that holds, it would be a big victory for real estate lobbyists, who have been vocal in their opposition to changing the deduction, but that could make the House bill even more expensive.

Cutting the corporate tax rate

Reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, from 35 percent, is at the center of both the House and the Senate tax plans. How soon they get there is the only difference. The House bill immediately cuts the corporate tax rate, fulfilling the wishes of President Trump.

The Senate imposes a one-year delay on lowering the rate, a move that allows Senate Republicans to preserve other deductions that the House eliminates. Economists have debated the effect that the delay will have on economic growth.

Now, the Senate is discussing whether to raise the rate above that 20 percent figure to help pay for other provisions or, possibly, to help defray the budget costs of the bill. Increasing the corporate tax rate would be a troublesome development for many Republicans and Mr. Trump, who have drawn a red line on a 20 percent corporate rate.

Small-business treatment

Republicans are united in their desire to give small businesses a tax break, but their plans differ in how to provide a tax cut. House lawmakers created a new 25 percent tax for so-called pass-through businesses — sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners. However, they erected guardrails to prevent the new rate from becoming a loophole that wealthy individuals can exploit by converting themselves into entities to take advantage of the 25 percent rate.

The Senate takes a different approach, creating a new deduction for pass-through businesses along with other incentives to promote investment. To satisfy the concerns of certain senators, including Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, the deduction is expected to be increased to 23 percent from the current 17.4 percent in the bill.

Making the tax code more ‘America First’

A main priority of the Republican tax effort has been making the United States’ tax system more competitive so that companies invest here and so that they do not have an incentive to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. The Senate plan will impose taxes on American and foreign companies that shift offshore money earned in the United States. There would be an effective minimum tax on money earned domestically and a 12.5 percent tax on foreign revenue from intellectual property.

The original House approach would have levied a 20 percent “excise tax” on payments between American and foreign companies that are affiliated with each other. This idea set off substantial confusion and opposition from drug and insurance lobbyists and was tweaked during the Ways and Means Committee’s amendment process.

Adoption, education, health

To cut business and individual tax rates and double the standard deduction for individuals and families, Republicans had to do away with many popular tax credits and other prized deductions. The House initially eliminated a tax credit for adoptions but later restored it. The House repealed deductions for medical expenses and counted tuition wavers that are widely used by graduate students as taxable income.

In the Senate, Republicans also preserve the adoption tax credit. Unlike the House, they maintain the deduction for medical expenses and provide “education relief” for graduate students.

To repeal, or not to repeal, the estate tax

Almost all Republicans agree philosophically that the estate tax — or, as they call it, the death tax — is unfair. But repealing it is costly, and the tax tends to hit only the very wealthy (and their heirs). House Republicans decided in their bill to double the amount of inherited wealth that is exempt from the tax to $11 million, from $5.5 million, and phase out the tax after six years. In a late amendment, they moved to delay its full repeal another year, to 2025.

In the Senate, the exemption is also doubled, but the death tax never dies.",REAL
Republicans Pass Sweeping Tax Rewrite 51-49,"Republicans pass Senate bill.

The Senate passed the Republicans’ sweeping tax overhaul with several holdouts throwing their support behind the bill.

Ms. Collins, who was the last big holdout, said she would support the bill after changes she wanted were made to the legislation.

Mr. Corker voted against the bill, the only Republican senator to object to the legislation.

Party leaders also picked up the votes of three other holdouts: Mr. Flake, Mr. Daines and Mr. Johnson.

Mr. McConnell and Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on Friday morning that Republicans had the 50 votes they need to pass the tax bill.

Republicans appeared increasingly confident as they milled into the Senate’s ornate Strom Thurmond Room to hash out the remaining details of a tax bill that has been a moving target.

Among the changes Ms. Collins secured was adding in a $10,000 property tax deduction into the Senate bill. Ms. Collins tweeted that she was “delighted” with the move.

Mr. Corker had pushed to scale back the tax cuts in the Senate bill in the wake of a report from the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation that projected the bill would add $1 trillion to deficits over the course of a decade, even after accounting for economic growth. On Thursday night, Republicans were discussing several possibilities for changing the bill to address deficit concerns, including gradually raising the corporate tax rate in later years.

But other Republicans resisted the idea of raising taxes, and on Friday, that idea was off the table.

“This is yet another tough vote. I am disappointed. I wanted to get to yes. But at the end of the day, I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that I believe, based on the information I currently have, could deepen the debt burden on future generations,” Mr. Corker said in a statement.

Mr. Trump sounded optimistic on Friday morning, in a tweet taunting Democrats over the bill’s prospects.

Democrats attack changes made “under the cover of darkness.”

Democrats took to the Senate floor and social media to attack Republicans over the speed of the bill and the last-minute changes being made, saying it was irresponsible to approve such significant legislation with little time to review it.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said the Republican bill had been worsened by changes made “under the cover of darkness.” He added that those provisions would “stuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations while raising taxes on millions in the middle class.

”We understand they have the votes to pass their bill,” Mr. Schumer said, “despite a process and a product that no one can be proud of and everyone should be ashamed of.”

Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, called it “Washington D.C. at its worst” in a video in which he held up a page of the bill with handwritten changes scribbled in the margins.

“This is unbelievable, we’re doing massive tax reform on an absolute incredible timeline,” he said. “This is going to affect everybody in this country.”

Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, posted a list of amendments to the bill on her Twitter account and cried foul over the fact that she got it from a lobbyist, not from her colleagues across the aisle.

“None of us have seen this list, but lobbyists have it,” Ms. McCaskill wrote. “Need I say more?”

Many of the last-minute changes were included to help convince a handful of holdout Republican senators, including Ms. Collins and Mr. Johnson, to throw their support behind the legislation. Others were included for reasons that left many Democrats crying foul.

Child tax credit expansion amendment was rejected.

In a closely watched vote, the Senate rejected an amendment that would have increased the child tax credit for low-income families while raising the corporate tax rate to 20.94 percent, from 20 percent as proposed in the tax bill.

Mr. Rubio, who implored senators earlier in the day to allow the change since it would still be a reduction from the current corporate rate of 35 percent, was rebuffed by fellow lawmakers, who rejected the amendment in a 29-to-71 vote.

Some changes were stricken.

A controversial provision that would have allowed parents to begin saving tax-free for the college education of an unborn child has been stripped from the Senate tax bill.

Republicans appear to have removed the provision after it was challenged by Democrats on parliamentary grounds, a Senate Democratic aide said.

Two less-controversial provisions were nixed or forced to be changed by the parliamentarian, who has broad power to determine which parts of a bill comply with the Senate budget reconciliation process.

A provision that would have targeted some foreign airlines was eliminated. Another, which would have granted assistance to Mississippi River flooding victims in 2016 was forced to be expanded, to cover all victims of federally designated disasters that year.

Party leaders gained four more votes on Friday.

Mr. Daines and Mr. Johnson had objected to the bill because of how it treated pass-through businesses, whose profits are distributed to owners and taxed at individual rates.

The Senate tax bill will now allow pass through owners to deduct 23 percent of their business income as a way of lowering their taxes, up from 17.4 percent in the original Senate bill.

“After weeks of fighting for Main Street businesses including Montana’s farmers and ranchers, I’ve decided to support the Senate tax cut bill, which provides significant tax relief for Main Street businesses,” Mr. Daines said in a statement on Friday morning.

Mr. Johnson said in a statement he also supports the bill.

Mr. Flake, in a statement, said he would support the tax bill after getting changes to a budget “gimmick” and a commitment that Senate leaders and the Trump administration would work with him on a legislative solution on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

Republicans are coming up with ways to pay for the changes.

On Friday, Republicans rejected the idea of putting in place tax increases that would take effect some years from now, a step that would soften the deficit effects of the legislation.

“Larding the bill up with new tax increases would have been going the wrong direction,” Mr. Cruz said.

But lawmakers still need to find ways to pay for the changes being made and congressional aides said it will likely be a combination of things including:

• Retaining the alternative minimum tax for corporations, which would raise $40 billion over a decade.

• Retaining a modified version of the individual AMT, which would raise $133 billion over a decade.

• Slightly increasing the tax rate on offshore assets under the “deemed repatriation” provision, which would raise $97 billion over a decade.

Who Gains From the Tax Plan? Economists Face Off.

Republican leaders say their proposals will fuel investment and job creation. Critics say that the rich are the beneficiaries and that debt will weigh on growth. We asked two economists, one from each side, to make their cases.

This bill has been promoted as a boon for the middle class. Does it fulfill that promise?

Douglas Holtz-Eakin:

Capital accumulation, productivity growth and living better: That is the case for tax reform. It would be an easier political sale if there were a straight line from the policy to the prosperity (which is why the left prefers programs that write checks). But the logic is sound, the evidence conclusive and the case for tax reform helping the middle class impeccable.

Kimberly A. Clausing:

This tax bill is not about workers. It is about giving shareholders and businesses lower taxes and merely hoping benefits will trickle down. Instead, give workers any tax cuts, and rely on the strength of the middle class to bubble up, strengthening American business. Sound tax reform should not lose revenue, and it should not give the vast majority of benefits to those at the top.

Another study says tax bill won’t pay for itself.

The independent Tax Policy Center said on Friday that the Senate tax bill would add $1.2 trillion to federal deficits over 10 years, even after accounting for increased economic growth. That deficit estimate was slightly higher than the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation projected on Thursday.

The so-called dynamic score from the center found that the bill, as approved in the Finance Committee, would increase economic growth by 0.7 percent next year, but that its growth boost would fade over a decade, as deficits and federal debt increase. The center said those benefits would be larger if the economy was struggling, and not operating under low unemployment: “Because the economy is currently near full employment, the impact of increased demand on output would be smaller and diminish more quickly than it would if the economy were in recession.”

Republican senators have criticized the center’s previous findings and largely dismissed the Joint Committee’s analysis on Thursday. They say they expect much larger growth effects than the analyses have found.

The independent Tax Foundation, which typically finds higher growth effects from tax cuts, has not yet released an analysis of the bill after it underwent significant amendments in committee.",REAL
Trump’s Red Line Is Holding Up Tax Cuts,"But Mr. Trump has drawn what the White House calls a red line in negotiations at a rate of 20 percent, putting Republicans in something of a box.

Spurred by Mr. Trump, many conservative groups are insisting on a 20 percent rate, which they say is critical to making the United States more competitive with other developing nations that have relatively low corporate rates. In a letter on Thursday, several groups in the conservative Koch network warned that a rate any higher than that would undermine the economic growth goals of the bill.

“Business tax relief is central to the goals of creating jobs and promoting economic growth,” they wrote, “and we are concerned that any effort to hold the corporate tax rate above 20 percent will substantially limit our ability to achieve those goals and expand opportunities for all Americans.”

The Koch network was instrumental in defeating a proposal from House Republican leaders earlier this year — known as border adjustment — that would have raised additional revenue by taxing imports. Eliminating that provision was a central focus of the network’s semiannual donor retreat in Colorado over the summer; officials there warned that it would drag on economic growth.

Republican leaders never found a sufficient replacement for the revenue that border adjustment was projected to raise to offset tax cuts. To the surprise of many lobbyists, they followed Mr. Trump’s lead and did not budge from the corporate rate of 20 percent. On Wednesday, Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah began calling for 22 percent, but they want that money to pay for an expanded child tax credit, not to offset losses.

The decisions made by Mr. Trump and Republican leaders leave just a few ways to meet Mr. Corker’s demands, including phasing out some tax cuts in the later years of the bill or making the cuts less generous.

It is possible that those negotiations will end with Mr. Trump’s 20 percent rate unscathed. It is possible that they will load the bill with provisions that economists warn could curb the growth effects of the cuts. There is a small chance that they could sink the bill altogether, if they do not succeed.

In recent days, Mr. Trump has drawn praise from Republicans for rousing senators’ support for the tax bill. He has also consistently prodded Congress to move quickly on tax issues, particularly since late summer, and congressional aides say the bill would not be advancing at such a dizzying pace if not for his pressure. It remains to be seen whether he will intervene on this matter or whether he will leave Republicans to work it out among themselves.",REAL
Trump’s First Major Trade Fight With China Could Be Over Solar Panels,"But American manufacturers say the cheap panels have been unfairly financed by the Chinese government. Chinese manufacturers have benefited from cheap loans from government-run banks. Even some Chinese companies that have struggled with losses and had trouble making loan payments have been able to stay afloat.

Such manufacturers in China “are technically insolvent, but they still get capital,” said Mark Widmar, the chief executive of First Solar, a large manufacturer based in Phoenix.

The United States has already imposed tariffs on solar panels from China over the past five years, prompting Chinese manufacturers to build vast factories in Southeast Asia. Now, the Trump administration has indicated it may raise the stakes by authorizing tariffs on all solar panel imports, including those from Southeast Asia.

Administration officials have so far allowed two solar panel companies with factories in the United States to ask Washington for tariffs on all solar panel imports.

Video

Thanks to a complicated series of maneuvers within the United States system for evaluating trade cases, the Trump administration now has a Jan. 26 deadline to grant the companies’ requests for wider tariffs.

China opposes the move, which it argues would hurt solar panel buyers. When the Chinese-owned factories in Southeast Asia are included, Chinese panel makers account for about four-fifths of global sales.

Solar panel installers, developers of utility-scale solar panel power generation projects and others connected to the industry also oppose broader tariffs. The Solar Energy Industries Association, which represents those groups, contends that the tariffs would destroy more installation jobs than they would protect or create among manufacturers.

“If my price goes up, I’m not going to win” orders, Abigail Ross Hopper, the chief executive and president of the Washington-based association, said in a telephone interview.

Yet the effects of tariffs are disputed within the industry. Solar panel makers in the United States say higher tariffs would add only modestly to the cost of projects.

“That’s still very compelling for any utility,” said Mr. Widmar, of First Solar.

Many trade experts predict the United States will impose tariffs on all solar panel imports, because Mr. Trump has expressed sympathy for industrial workers in the United States and for fossil fuels, while voicing skepticism about the use of renewable energy.

If the Trump administration decides to impose more tariffs next month, it could be the first blow in a one-two punch to China on trade, making it even more likely that Beijing might retaliate against American exports. The deadline for the administration to act on possibly imposing tariffs on washing machines from around the world, and particularly from China, comes a little more than a week later, on Feb. 3.

Mr. Li, the Chinese economic adviser, contended that China, not the United States, was the country that had proved willing to let market forces determine winners and losers in the solar panel market. China had 800 solar panel companies a decade ago and now has just 70 or 80, after allowing the rest to become insolvent. Yet China’s solar panel production has more than quintupled in the past decade because, he said, Beijing has allowed market forces to winnow the industry to the most efficient competitors.

By contrast, political support in the United States for solar panel manufacturing wilted after a single solar equipment company in California, Solyndra, collapsed in 2011 after obtaining $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees.

“You are a little bit worried by Solyndra; very small companies, why are you worried about them?” Mr. Li said. “Then you hurt all the users.”",REAL
Trump Pressed Top Republicans to End Senate Russia Inquiry,"“It is pressure that should never be brought to bear by an official when the legislative branch is in the process of an investigation,” Ms. Feinstein said.

Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, said on Thursday that the president had not acted improperly. Mr. Trump, he said, “at no point has attempted to apply undue influence on committee members’’ and believes “there is no evidence of collusion and these investigations must come to a fair and appropriate completion.’’

Mr. Trump’s requests of lawmakers to end the Senate investigation came during a period in the summer when the president was particularly consumed with Russia and openly raging at his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from any inquiries into Russian meddling in the election. Mr. Trump often vented to his own aides and even declared his innocence to virtual strangers he came across on his New Jersey golf course.

In this same period, the president complained frequently to Mr. McConnell about not doing enough to bring the investigation to an end, a Republican official close to the leader said.

Republicans played down Mr. Trump’s appeals, describing them as the actions of a political newcomer unfamiliar with what is appropriate presidential conduct.

Mr. Burr said he did not feel pressured by the president’s appeal, portraying it as the action of someone who has “never been in government.” But he acknowledged other members of his committee have had similar discussions with Mr. Trump. “Everybody has promptly shared any conversations that they’ve had,” Mr. Burr said.

One of them was Mr. Blunt, who was flying on Air Force One with Mr. Trump to Springfield, Mo., in August when he found himself being lobbied by the president “to wrap up this investigation,” according to a Republican official familiar with the conversation.

Mr. Blunt was not bothered by Mr. Trump’s comments, the official said, because he did not see them bearing a “sinister motive.’’

But Mr. Burr and Mr. Blunt have both taken steps to limit their interaction with Mr. Trump this year, not wanting to create the perception of coziness as they conduct a highly sensitive investigation into contacts between the president’s campaign and Moscow last year.

Robert S. Mueller III, the Justice Department’s special counsel who is leading a separate investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, is also examining whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice when he fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was running a federal inquiry into the matter.

Mr. Trump also called other lawmakers over the summer with requests that they push Mr. Burr to finish the inquiry, according to a Republican senator who requested anonymity to discuss his contact with the president.

This senator, who was alarmed upon hearing word of the president’s pleas, said Mr. Trump’s request to the other senators was clear: They should urge Mr. Burr to bring the Russia investigation to a close. The senator declined to reveal which colleagues Mr. Trump had contacted with the request.

Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers feared he would move to fire Mr. Mueller, an option that the president pointedly left open in an Oval Office interview with The New York Times in July.

During this time, Mr. Trump made several calls to senators without senior staff present, according to one West Wing official. According to senators and other Republicans familiar with the conversations, Mr. Trump would begin the talks on a different topic but eventually drift toward the Russia investigation.

In conversations with Mr. McConnell and Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Trump voiced sharp anger that congressional Republicans were not helping lift the cloud of suspicion over Russia, the senators told political allies. The Times reported in August that the president had complained to Mr. McConnell that he was failing to shield Mr. Trump from an ongoing Senate inquiry.

The earlier call with Mr. Burr, however, was perhaps the most invasive, given Mr. Burr’s role directly supervising the Senate’s investigation of Mr. Trump.

Mr. Burr told other senators that Mr. Trump had stressed that it was time to “move on” from the Russia issue, using that language repeatedly, according to people who spoke with Mr. Burr over the summer. One Republican close to Mr. Burr, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Trump had been “very forceful.”

Asked why Mr. Trump is so irritated with the investigation, Mr. Burr said: “In his world it hampers his ability to project the strength he needs to convey on foreign policy.”

Mr. Burr said Mr. Trump was not fully aware of the impropriety of his request because the president still has the mind-set of a businessman rather than a politician. “Businessmen are paid to skip things that they think they can skip and get away with,” he said.

This past summer, Mr. Trump also contacted Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who in August introduced a bipartisan bill limiting the president’s power to dismiss special prosecutors — a measure widely seen as aimed at protecting Mr. Mueller from Mr. Trump. In an interview this week, Mr. Tillis said the president “just asked me where my head was” on the legislation and described the exchange as “pleasant.” Mr. Trump did not press him on the Senate investigation, said Mr. Tillis, who is not on the intelligence committee.

Republicans said Mr. Trump’s ire often went beyond the intelligence committee investigation and spilled over a range of issues that touched on Russia and his relationship with Congress.

Another Republican senator said Mr. Trump had not urged him to help bring the Russia inquiry to a halt. Instead, the senator said, the president nudged him to begin an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s connection with the intelligence-gathering firm Fusion GPS, which produced a dossier of allegations about Mr. Trump’s ties to Moscow.

Mr. McConnell — who over the summer was quickly notified of Mr. Trump’s calls to his Senate colleagues — told multiple associates that Mr. Trump appeared unable to distinguish traditional policy concerns about Russia from more specific questions about Russian interference in the presidential race.

The Senate leader told associates that Mr. Trump did not seem to recognize that the Republican Party traditionally took a suspicious view of Russia, or that lawmakers could favor punishing Russia without questioning Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016. The president had reluctantly signed a bill imposing sanctions on Moscow on Aug. 2, using an extraordinary written statement to lash out against what he viewed as a usurping of executive authority from a Congress that “could not even negotiate a health care bill after seven years of talking.”

Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell told associates, appeared inclined to treat criticism of Russian meddling in the United States as giving credence to unproven allegations that his campaign colluded with foreign actors.

In that respect, Mr. Trump’s private consternation mirrored some of his public complaints about the Russia issue. He has continued to seethe regularly, and openly, about the scrutiny of Russia’s political activities, tweeting just last weekend: “Since the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia, Russia.”",REAL
