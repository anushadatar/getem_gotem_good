Mayor Tries to Save Warren Buffett's Old Berkshire Hathaway Headquarters,"Jon Mitchell, the mayor of New Bedford, Mass., near the old Hathaway mill. Dominick Reuter for The Wall Street Journal

NEW BEDFORD, Mass.—Americans tend to celebrate the birthplaces of great businesses, such as the garage in Los Altos, Calif., where Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started Apple Inc. and Sam Walton's Five and Dime in Bentonville, Ark., the origin of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

But there is little support thus far for a campaign by the mayor of New Bedford, Mass., to save from the bulldozer a squat, dilapidated office building once the headquarters of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Control of the New England textile manufacturer was acquired in 1965 by an ambitious 34-year-old investor named Warren Buffett, who made Berkshire Hathaway the base of his own budding conglomerate. It, of course, went on to become synonymous with investing prowess and business success.

But there is now a problem facing New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell in his efforts to salvage the property: The story of the old mill headquarters doesn't exactly fit the Buffett mystique.

The billionaire investor, famous for his golden touch, lost money on the Berkshire Hathaway deal, even though the mill's cash flow helped fund the early growth of the conglomerate. Famously unemotional about his investments, Mr. Buffett originally bought the mill partly because he was upset at the company's then owner, he acknowledges in a phone interview.

Mr. Buffett even regrets transforming Berkshire Hathaway into his holding company. ""One of the dumbest things was to make a textile company the base of other things we bought or invested in,"" Mr. Buffett said. He never considered changing the name, though.

Mayor Mitchell is running out of time. The current owner of the 86-year-old office building wants to level it for a parking lot. The mayor has persuaded him to hold off for a few months in a final push to find a buyer.

To save the structure, Mr. Mitchell is trying to find a tenant or to drum up interest among preservationists. ""This is where the Berkshire Hathaway empire was launched,"" the mayor says. ""It has a very significant connection not only to New Bedford's history but to the life and times of Warren Buffett.""

Today the building, which has stood unoccupied and dark for about five years, looks primed for the wrecking ball. Thieves have torn away much of the oxidized copper molding that decorates its eaves. Several of its interior walls stand gutted to their studs. Sheets of paint hang peeling from other walls, and the flat roof has leaked water.

Rui DeMatos, who worked as a loom mechanic at Berkshire Hathaway in the early 1980s, now owns and operates the Alianca Restaurant across the street from the headquarters. ""The way it is [now] is bad,"" Mr. DeMatos said. ""Whatever happens there would make it better. But to preserve it would be tough.""

The building, built in 1927 by Hathaway Manufacturing Co., once had more charm. Its expansive offices feature oak and mahogany paneling and a marble fireplace. In 1955, Hathaway merged with Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates Inc. to become Berkshire Hathaway.

In 1962, Mr. Buffett began buying Berkshire Hathaway stock under a reasonable investment strategy. Berkshire Hathaway was closing plants to cut costs, using the savings to buy back its stock. Mr. Buffett's plan: Buy the stock and sell it back to the company at a higher price.

But things soon got personal. According to Alice Schroeder's 2008 biography of Mr. Buffett, ""The Snowball,"" an account his assistant confirmed, Mr. Buffett recalls that Berkshire Hathaway's president, Seabury Stanton, offered in person to buy Mr. Buffett's stock at $11.50 per share. But when Mr. Stanton later sent a formal offer, the price was 11 3/8.

The alleged lowball offer angered Mr. Buffett, who then amassed a majority stake in Berkshire Hathaway and gained a seat on its board with the intent of replacing Mr. Stanton as president. At a 1965 board meeting in the conference room at the New Bedford headquarters, Mr. Buffett and other directors listened as Mr. Stanton and his son, Jack, read terse resignation letters and stalked out, according to Mr. Buffett's recollection and Ms. Schroeder's book.

The Stantons both since have died. Seabury Stanton's grandson, John ""Jack"" Stanton Jr., declined to comment on the disagreement, explaining that only his grandfather and Mr. Buffett were involved in the talks.

But Mr. Stanton says his family wants the headquarters preserved even though the Stantons' ouster from the textile maker was ""ruinous"" emotionally. ""There are definitely both positive and negative feelings about Berkshire Hathaway and its role in the history of our family,"" he says. ""We would all prefer that [the headquarters] remains as a landmark and a positive memory.""

For Mr. Buffett, it was a Pyrrhic victory. Foreign competition eventually overwhelmed the mill, and Mr. Buffett closed it in 1985. He wrote to his shareholders at the time: ""In the end nothing worked and I should be faulted for not quitting sooner.""

Mr. Buffett's company sold the New Bedford mill complex in 2000, for a scant $215,000, to entrepreneur Roland Letendre, who houses his business making military parachutes in part of the 18-acre complex.

In 2007, Mr. Letendre sold three of the buildings in the complex to a business owner who now wants to lease out the building adjacent to the former headquarters to a marijuana grow house, part of Massachusetts' budding medical marijuana industry. The mayor, however, has said he wants to snuff the possibility of marijuana businesses in most of the 226-year-old city, including the old Berkshire complex.

Today, Mr. Letendre, 59 years old, oversees his companies from one of several cavernous, redbrick mill buildings. Decorating his office are a funhouse mirror, a mechanical fortune teller and a fake sarcophagus, which he bought at yard sales. On the walls hang the salvaged portraits of the stern-faced executives of Berkshire Hathaway, from Horatio Hathaway in 1889 to Seabury Stanton in the 1960s.

Mr. Letendre in 2008 put the old headquarters on the block for $500,000. With no takers, he decided early this year to demolish it.

""I'm not going to put a bunch of money into the building in the hope that a tenant will come along,"" Mr. Letendre says. ""That's not good business.""

New Bedford's economic-development staff has shown the headquarters in recent months to potential buyers, offering the city's help with financing.

Mr. Letendre emailed Mr. Buffett in October, alerting him that the building is on the block. Mr. Buffett's response: No, thanks. ""I don't know what you'd do with that place,"" Mr. Buffett said in the interview.

Uninsured-Driver Dilemma,"Patrick McGehee and his wife were returning to his sister's Oklahoma City neighborhood from dinner when a driver plowed through a stop sign and crashed into the Jeep in which they were riding, sending them both to the hospital with serious injuries.

More bad news came several days after the 2011 accident, when they saw the police report: The at-fault driver didn't have insurance, making Mr. McGehee and his family responsible for thousands of dollars of health-care bills.

An estimated 14% of drivers nationally are uninsured, according to the industry-funded Insurance Research Council—a chronic problem that states have been unable to solve. While auto insurance has been mandated in most states for decades, lawmakers and insurance regulators say they feel increasing pressure to tackle the problem, which results in higher rates for drivers who do follow the law.

Many have decided that the traditional deterrent—the threat of fines—isn't enough. In search of alternatives, states are experimenting with the use of databases to better identify the uninsured, programs that remove the license plates from vehicles driven by offenders and ""no pay, no play"" laws that restrict the ability of uninsured drivers to sue for damages after accidents.

Most states require liability coverage to pay for any damage and injuries caused by the driver. A bare-bones liability policy costs about $500 a year nationwide on average—while fines for not having liability coverage typically range from $100 to $500, according to trade groups.

Alex Hageli, director of auto-insurance policy for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, said uninsured drivers weigh ""what are the odds"" of being caught against ""what will I get in a fine and court costs?""

The average annual bill is $907 for people who buy the required liability coverage as well as coverage for damage they cause to their own car plus uninsured and underinsured motorists' coverage, according to Mr. Hageli's group, based on data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The uninsured and underinsured coverage can account for as much as about $100 of a family's annual insurance bill, totaling about $11 billion to $12 billion nationwide, according to Mr. Hageli's group.

John Doak, Oklahoma's insurance commissioner, said he has ""yet to be in a room [for a speech] where there wasn't someone there who was hit, or a had a family member who was hit"" by an uninsured driver.

In November, Oklahoma became at least the third state to put into effect a law that allows troopers to yank license plates from uninsured motorists. The driver can reclaim the confiscated tag from a sheriff's department after obtaining car insurance and paying a $125 administrative fee, a $250 fine and court and some other costs.

Mr. McGehee, the Oklahoma City accident victim, and his wife, Megan, hired a lawyer to sue the at-fault driver, who had ignored a stop sign, according to a police report. But the 24-year-old man, who couldn't be reached for comment, appeared to have few assets, so ""all we would do was incur legal expenses for pursuing the lawsuit,"" said Mr. McGehee, 28, a city engineering inspector in Dallas.

Under a deal negotiated by their lawyer, the McGehees resolved more than $550,000 in medical bills with money from their families' uninsured-motorist coverages and health insurance. A weightlifting enthusiast, Mr. McGehee is sidelined indefinitely due to internal injuries from the crash. He said he faces $6,000 in yearly medical costs as his treatment continues, due to health-insurance deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.

California, meanwhile, has had limited success with a program to make coverage more affordable to low-income drivers with good driving records.

In Sacramento, Virginia Evans, who relies on Social Security income, obtained an approximately $300-a-year, bare-bones liability policy through the program. ""I wasn't going to be eating much,"" she said of higher-priced policies she had considered before learning about the cheaper alternative. But only about 11,000 drivers were recently participating in the program, which went statewide in 2007—though California has an estimated three million uninsured motorists. The low participation shows how difficult it can be to solve the problem even when policy prices are rock bottom, industry executives said. California is examining whether its eligibility criteria are too stringent and is refining its marketing efforts.

Among other efforts to get more people insured, Missouri in September joined about 10 other states to adopt a ""no pay, no play"" law, under which uninsured drivers who are in accidents caused by insured drivers can't sue for pain and suffering, with certain exceptions.

A 2012 Insurance Research Council study concluded that a state's uninsured-motorist rate can fall by as much as 1.6% under such a law, a decline it calls ""moderate, yet statistically significant."" Critics maintain that the laws unfairly take away people's right to sue, though some of the older law have withstood legal challenge.

Some states have turned to database firms to identify the uninsured. The companies cross check car registrations against insurers' policyholder lists to counteract a common trick in which drivers buy coverage to get a car registered, then stop paying the premiums. Mississippi hired a database vendor earlier this year, and Rhode Island has been soliciting bids.

In about eight states, police and other state officials can query an industry-developed, web-based system in real time to verify the existence of coverage.

But some such programs have hit roadblocks. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana last year challenged a 2010 law under which the state's Bureau of Motor Vehicles randomly selected people from a database of drivers who had been convicted of operating a vehicle without insurance. The state demanded proof of insurance to avoid suspension of their drivers' licenses—even if they didn't currently own a vehicle.

The ACLU maintained the program violated due-process rights. It won a preliminary injunction, and the state since has discontinued the effort.

Overseas Money Pours Into Miami Real Estate,"MIAMI—Cranes are again rising over this city, as the poster child for the real-estate collapse enjoys a new condominium boom fueled by foreign investors looking to park their money in U.S. real estate.

For several years after the housing bubble burst, a glut of towering condo buildings sat largely empty. Condo values plunged nearly 60% from peak to trough, according to the Miami Association of Realtors. Financing for buyers and developers dried up.

Now nearly all the once-vacant units are filled up, and demand is outstripping supply. There are 118 condo towers proposed in the Miami area, including 35 under construction, according to Condo Vultures LLC, a real-estate consultancy.

The 41 towers proposed for downtown will add 12,100 new units—well shy of the 22,200 units that were built during the 2003 to 2008 boom, but still a remarkable turnabout given that downtown construction was essentially dormant until 2011.

""This boom is very reminiscent of where we were a decade ago,"" said Peter Zalewski, principal at Condo Vultures.

While the growth feels similar to the bubble-fueled oversupply that remains a painful memory in Miami, developers note that robust international demand has created a new cash-financing model they believe is safer than the easy bank loans that fueled the last boom. They typically require buyers to put down at least 50% before closing, which means the owners would lose their money if they walked away.

Under the new payment arrangement, developers are relying more on buyers' deposits, and less on debt, to fund construction, which they say puts projects on more solid footing. And because banks have become stricter about what projects they finance, less-experienced developers are weeded out, they say.

Developer Carlos Melo relied on that financing model to build 23 Biscayne Bay, a 17-story project that last year became the first completed tower of the new cycle. He said the building is fully sold, and roughly 90% of the owners bought their units as investments and are renting them out. ""They are looking to sit their money in a safe place,"" Mr. Melo said.

Miami is just a bigger example of a recent national tilt toward multifamily buildings—both apartments and condominiums—instead of the single-family homes that dominated during the bubble years leading up to the recession. While the majority of national construction is still of single-family homes, the recent rebound in construction activity—whether measured by new starts or permits—has been centered in multifamily buildings.

Commerce Department data released last week showed nationwide residential building permits rose to their strongest pace since June 2008, a rise that was driven by a 15% surge in multifamily permits. About one in three building permits issued this year has been for the largest multifamily category—buildings that have five or more units—according to Jed Kolko, chief economist for real-estate website Trulia. From the 1990s until the housing bubble ramped up in 2004, the share hovered around one in five.

Nationally, builders are responding to rental demand that remained strong through the recession and today's still-tepid recovery. They are also correcting the source of overbuilding during the bubble years.

""Multifamily has been a critical part of the construction recovery. During the bubble a lot of the overbuilding was in single-family homes, and as the construction market rebounds and as more people are looking for rentals, builders have responded with more multifamily construction,"" Mr. Kolko said.

The numbers are even more dramatic in and around Miami. In the South Florida region composed of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, roughly 70% of residential construction permits issued through October have been for multifamily units.

About 7,000 rental apartment units have been proposed for Miami's greater downtown area, Condo Vultures' Mr. Zalewski said. Among the factors driving growth are high rental rates and financing that is more readily available because banks consider the rental market strong. While the median rental rate in 2009 was $1.48 a square foot, it is now $2.23 a square foot, Mr. Zalewski said.

The city's condo boom has been even stronger, fueled by foreign investors who typically pay cash and are looking to hold rentals, instead of flipping for profit as investors did in the last cycle. About 85% to 90% of new-construction buyers are foreign, mostly Latin American, estimates Alicia Cervera Lamadrid, managing partner at Cervera Real Estate, which is handling sales for 16 condo projects.

""The payment structure really separated the speculators from the well-funded,"" Ms. Cervera Lamadrid said.

Buyers say they are drawn to Miami's increasingly cosmopolitan vibe and cultural offerings such as the Pérez Art Museum Miami, which is set to open Dec. 4. They also consider such investments more secure than leaving their money in more economically volatile places like Argentina and Venezuela.

Miami's high-end condo market has proved especially vibrant, and has gone hand in hand with new luxury shopping destinations rising up in the Brickell financial district downtown and the Design District to the north. Some of the most lavish projects have drawn star architects like Zaha Hadid and Bjarke Ingels.

In August, Umberto Mascagni, a 24-year-old Italian who moved to Miami three years ago to study international business, put down a deposit on a $700,000 two-bedroom condo in a proposed tower overlooking Biscayne Bay that has yet to break ground. He and his father began investing in Miami real estate in 2008 and now have six additional condos they rent out. ""In the past two years, the market has been crazy,"" Mr. Mascagni said. He is prowling for other investment opportunities, he said, but ""always with open eyes, always careful.""

Still, some are sounding cautionary notes. Developers are sometimes starting construction with just buyers' deposits, without lining up financing to ensure they can finish it off, said John Sumberg, managing partner of the law firm Bilzin Sumberg, who advises developers. ""They figure, 'I'll get it when I need it,' "" he said. But ""at some point in the cycle, the lenders may say there's too much product and this isn't a good bet.""

In addition, some developers are backing away from buying land because prices have risen so much, Mr. Sumberg said. That could ""curb the dramatic velocity we've seen"" in new construction, he said.

Carlos Rosso, who heads the condo division for the Related Group, a developer burned badly in the last cycle, said a similar bust is unlikely this time around. ""As long as there's cash from buyers and banks are disciplined enough not to overextend themselves, I think this is a long market because there's so little supply,"" he said. His company now has 10 condo projects under way, compared with more than 30 it built in the last upcycle.

Also, the sales pace isn't as frenzied as in the last decade. ""Back then, I saw lines at sales offices starting at 12:00 the night before"" they opened, said Alan Ojeda, chief executive of the Rilea Group, a developer. ""I don't see lines now.""

"Lumber Price Faces Pressure on Seasonal Change, Supply Increases","Lumber prices are getting chopped after notching seven-month highs, as the market hunkers down for a seasonal decline in construction and expected higher production next year.

But demand for U.S. boards and planks from China, Japan and the Caribbean to structure home interiors and to build shipping pallets and furniture is expected to keep the market from a deep slump.

Basswood lumber being prepared for overseas shipment atamill in Laona, Wis. Bloomberg News

U.S. lumber exports overseas have grown sharply, rising 22% in the first nine months of this year from the same period a year ago, to 701 million board feet. China, which accounts for 35% of the U.S.'s offshore exports, increased its purchases in the same period by 67%.

That demand helped send lumber prices to $378.30 per thousand board feet on Nov. 15, the highest value for the spot contract since April 4. On Friday, lumber for January delivery rose $3.60 to $364.80 per 1,000 board feet on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .

But some analysts say they expect prices to decline in the near term. They are questioning whether prices are high enough to drive away customers, who can buy cheaper wood from other major producers, such as Canada.

""No doubt there's better demand in this market than I've seen in a long time, but is it sustainable?"" said Robin Cross, chief operating officer at futures brokerage Paul Court Co. and a floor broker at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Exports have been driving the demand picture for lumber in part because of the sluggish pace of U.S. new-home construction as mortgage rates have crept higher. In addition, construction is grinding to a halt in the U.S. as the weather turns colder.

That is partly because the U.S. and Canada, two of the biggest softwood producers, are expected to raise production next year. The U.S. is projected to produce 33.62 billion board feet in 2014, up 13% from this year, while Canada's output is likely to rise 2.6% to 26.39 billion board feet, according to Forest Economic Advisers LLC, a Westford, Mass., industry-consulting firm.

Canada is expected to increase production even as British Columbia's forests are being devastated by the mountain pine beetle.

West Fraser Timber Co. and Canfor Corp. each said in late October that they would permanently close a sawmill in British Columbia in 2014, which also helped lumber prices spike earlier in November.

""The reality is that each company is going to transfer those logs to the mills that are staying open and in fact are going to produce more lumber next year,"" said Paul Jannke, principal at Forest Economic Advisors.

""There's a good chance prices are going to keep coming off for the next month or so,"" Mr. Jannke said.

Adding to U.S. supplies is a trade agreement that allows more Canadian wood to be shipped to the U.S. when prices for domestic producers are high. If U.S. producers such as Weyerhaeuser Co. can find buyers for framing wood above $355—an average calculated by Random Lengths, an industry publication that tracks sawmill prices—then there would be no export charge on wood shipped from Canada to the U.S. If prices are below those levels, a monthly tax rate and some volume constraints can be applied to Canada's lumber exports.

""It could be a perfect storm, with no duty on Canadian lumber, the winter weather, and the potential for even higher home mortgage rates while prices for wood remain at historically high prices,"" said Mr. Cross. ""Those are killers for a lumber market.""

No Penalties Planned in Swaps Probe,"A four-year-old U.S. Justice Department civil probe into allegations that large banks and others conspired to thwart competition in the $24.3 trillion market for credit-default swaps is winding down and penalties aren't planned, said people familiar with the matter.

Credit-default swaps are insurance-like contracts used by traders and investors to bet on the creditworthiness of companies and countries. The instruments were behind the September 2008 taxpayer rescue of American International Group Inc., AIG -0.13% which faced a liquidity crisis after the housing bust spurred hefty cash demands on swaps tied to souring mortgage-related investments.

The market was targeted in the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, as regulators and legislators sought to make trading more transparent and prevent another crisis. The Justice Department antitrust probe stemmed from allegations that the large banks that act as dealers in the market, matching buyers and sellers using prices that aren't widely published, colluded to prevent exchanges and other outsiders from entering the business.

The latest developments in the Justice Department's probe underscore the difficulties U.S. authorities have had in pursuing financial-crisis-era cases.

More than 100 people and firms have been charged with fraud tied to the financial crisis. But no charges have been brought against companies or top executives in some of the most memorable episodes from the 2008 meltdown, including the market run on AIG and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

""Four years is a long time for an antitrust investigation,"" said Joshua Soven, a partner at law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and a former chief of litigation at the antitrust division of the Justice Department.

People close to the matter said that investigators in U.S. civil probes generally seek injunctions to stop anticompetitive conduct from occurring. But if investigators believe the relevant behavior has been remedied—as prosecutors involved in the CDS probe think Dodd-Frank has largely succeeded in doing—investigators might see less reason to seek penalties.

The Justice Department probe remains open, with investigators evaluating whether new regulations are opening the market to more competitive trading, and examining trading in the much-smaller market for so-called credit futures, the people familiar said. Investigators also are monitoring a parallel probe in Europe that could result in fines for banks and the companies they control, the people said.

The Justice Department has spent the past four years combing through trading data, messages, emails and documents about credit-default swaps, the people said. The probe has focused on trading among a small cadre of CDS traders who conducted most of their business over the phone rather than via computer technology that records and distributes prices.

Investigators also have been looking at information services supporting the market for signs the banks and others were controlling access to pricing data and licenses, as well as the clearing of trades, the people said.

U.S. prosecutors early on sought information from Markit Group Ltd., a provider of information on CDS prices and trading data, and the big banks that control the London-based company. The banks include Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley , the people familiar said.

A Markit spokesman declined to comment, but the company previously said it ""continues to cooperate and assist"" authorities.

In recent regulatory filings, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said they are cooperating with the U.S. probe and the parallel European investigation into CDS practices that was opened in 2011. Barclays PLC and J.P. Morgan also referred to the probes in filings. A spokesman for Barclays said the bank was cooperating. Representatives for the other banks declined to comment further.

This past July, European authorities said they were weighing charges in a probe of 13 investment banks, Markit and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, saying they ""colluded to prevent exchanges from entering the credit derivatives business between 2006 and 2009."" Trading in credit-default swaps has been a lucrative business for large banks, with the largest players taking in billions of dollars of revenue.

Separately, several private lawsuits alleging anticompetitive behavior in CDS were filed in the U.S. this year. Four named the banks, Markit and ISDA as defendants, accusing them of blocking companies from launching businesses that would have helped swaps trading become more transparent.

ISDA declined to comment but previously said it has ""acted properly at all times,"" and that the allegations against it were without merit.

CME Group Inc. and Deutsche Börse AG's Eurex Exchange in 2007 listed credit derivatives on their exchanges. Their efforts met with little success, in part because of dealer resistance and a lack of regulation before the crisis to drive the expansion of the market, according to people familiar with the matter.

The value of swaps outstanding has shrunk by more than half from its precrisis peak size of nearly $60 trillion, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements.

Some market participants expected investors to embrace credit futures launched in June by IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. The futures have been slowed by questions about their design, said traders. Since Aug. 2, only 26 contracts have been traded. ICE declined to comment.

Why Everyone Will Totally Read This Column,"The headquarters of the news-and-entertainment site Gawker in New York City's SoHo in October 2010. Benjamin Norman for The Wall Street Journal

Neetzan Zimmerman doesn't like to be called a machine. That word implies something cold and inhuman about how he works, and Mr. Zimmerman believes that what makes him so good at his job is precisely the opposite sensibility: Unlike a computer, he understands the emotions that might compel a human being to click on something online.

Mr. Zimmerman is a 32-year-old editor at the news-and-entertainment site Gawker, where he's responsible for posting ""viral"" content—videos, photos, crazy local news stories—that readers can't resist sharing with everyone they know. ""Mom Fined $140 Every Day Until She Circumcises Her Child"" or ""Black Man Arrested Dozens of Times for 'Trespassing' While At Work."" With his posts generating more than 30 million page views a month, Mr. Zimmerman may be the most popular blogger working on the Web today.

Indeed, Mr. Zimmerman earns traffic so reliably that it's tempting to dismiss him as an automaton who simply posts every sensational news story that comes along, or as a mere ""aggregator"" who doesn't contribute anything original to journalism. But that take misses Mr. Zimmerman's skill. He posts only about a dozen items a day. Almost every one becomes a big traffic hit—an astonishing rate of success. I've worked on the Web for years, and I still have trouble predicting which of my stories will be hits and which will appeal only to my mom. Mr. Zimmerman has somehow cracked the code.

His secret, he says, is a deep connection to his audience's evolving, irreducibly human, primal sensibilities. Usually within a few seconds of seeing an item, Mr. Zimmerman can sense whether it's destined to become a viral story. ""I guess you could call it intuition,"" he says.

Neetzan Zimmerman says his secret is a deep connection to his audience's evolving, primal sensibilities. Provided by Neetzan Zimmerman

Mr. Zimmerman's technique and his role at Gawker Media have been held up as either craven pandering or a model for news businesses struggling to sustain journalism online. Or both. They also provide lessons to marketers looking to push their products. But what's most interesting about Mr. Zimmerman is the way he has melded mind and machine. We live in an age marked by constant battles between workers and technology, one in which computers threaten to come after all of our jobs. Mr. Zimmerman's success suggests a defense against the computers: Though his job wouldn't be possible without the Internet, he has found a gap for human intuition in an environment dominated by machines. The lesson applies far beyond the news business—if you're working in an industry being assaulted by computers, your survival depends on becoming a scholar of your fellow humans.

I first noticed Mr. Zimmerman's popularity a few months ago, when I saw an astonishing chart of traffic at Gawker. In a good month, the second-most-popular writer at the site will earn about five million page views (which isn't anything to sneeze at). Mr. Zimmerman usually generates many times that amount, often more than everyone else at Gawker combined.

Mr. Zimmerman's dominance is part of Gawker's plan. By earning so much traffic on his own, he effectively subsidizes the rest of the staff, liberating them to pursue deeper, longer, more experimental pieces. This isn't a new model in journalism—bundling the cheap, revenue-generating content with expensive, high-minded content is how newspapers made money for decades—but it has now become the touchstone model of the Web, in use at Gawker, BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post and dozens of smaller sites.

Gawker hired Mr. Zimmerman in 2012, but he has been in the viral news business since 2008, when he started The Daily What, a site where he collected the most sharable stuff he found online. At first, he had no idea there was any money in sharable stuff. Viral content was Mr. Zimmerman's passion, and he sought to treat it as seriously as a ""real"" journalist would treat the news. When he talks about his love for the crazy videos and photos we all share online, Mr. Zimmerman is apt to get carried away. ""For me to be plugged into this stuff is like being plugged into the foundation of man,"" Mr. Zimmerman says. ""This is the stuff that people really care about, not the stuff that they're pretending to care about at cocktail parties.""

Mr. Zimmerman gets to his computer at around 7:30 every morning and begins scanning a feed of more than 1,000 sites that he has identified as highlighting viral content. He scrolls through the feed quickly, spending just a few seconds assessing each item. He looks at the subject of the story and the major themes it might elicit: Is it cute, outrageous, heartwarming, hilarious, anger-inducing? He scans the ""metrics"" on the post—the number of Facebook likes or Twitter mentions—which are often a sign of incipient virality.

Because he's constantly scrutinizing his traffic to figure out why certain posts do well and others don't, Mr. Zimmerman also keeps a running list of ""hot"" themes in his head. ""It might be that right now, people don't care about stories about cats that much, and instead, sloths are more popular,"" he says. ""So I'll have a rule—cats are out, sloths are in, focus on sloths because that's going to be your meal ticket.""

The whole process happens very quickly. ""Within 15 seconds, I know whether an item is going to work,"" Mr. Zimmerman says. He usually has a headline ready to go a few seconds after that. ""It's a biological algorithm,"" he says. ""I've put myself into the system—I've sort of become the system—so that when I see something I'm instantly thinking of how well it it's going to do."" Indeed, Mr. Zimmerman says he can no longer tell the difference between stories he finds interesting and stories that will be popular. ""If it's not worth posting then I'm not interested,"" he says.

I spent two hours talking to Mr. Zimmerman, and during a lot of that time I tried to plumb his weaknesses. Could a smart machine—say, a system built by a big social network like Facebook, one that was privy to lots of data about which stories people like—beat him?

He doesn't think so. While machines have lots of data, Mr. Zimmerman says they wouldn't be very good, yet, at intuiting subtle, collective changes in human preferences as quickly as he can. ""I'm following the big story arcs online, like in a soap opera,"" he says. ""Like within a trend of cats, different cats will have moments where they're popular: Grumpy Cat is not popular now, but maybe it's Lil Bub."" Zimmerman doesn't track this with a spreadsheet or any formal system. He just sort of feels the changes, on a day-to-day basis, as the viral news turns.

Mr. Zimmerman's real worry, actually, isn't machines but other people, specifically, marketers. Over the last few years viral news has been co-opted by advertisers, pranksters, political operatives and others looking to sell something. When he can, Mr. Zimmerman tries to note when a story looks fishy and might harbor some ulterior motive. But telling the truth kills virality, reducing traffic. ""Once Internet culture eats itself, will I be able to do my job?"" he wonders. ""When speaking truth to Internet culture doesn't result in traffic … when that happens, I may lose my edge and I'll have to find something else to do.""

"Union Targets Hospitals in California, Oregon","The nation's largest health-care union is threatening to mount ballot initiatives in California and Oregon that it says would lower health-care costs, but industry officials say the real goal is to pressure hospitals into making it easier for the union to organize thousands of workers.

Proposed measures in both states would cap executive pay and limit how much hospitals can charge consumers. Both sides say they are prepared to spend millions on opposing campaigns if the measures get on the ballots in November 2014.

Dave Regan, head of the biggest SEIU local in California, said he is prepared to spend millions of dollars on voter initiatives if hospitals in the state don't engage with the union. Jason Henry for The Wall Street Journal

But before it gets to that point, the Service Employees International Union said it could back off if the industry agrees to work with the union. Hospitals can join with the SEIU, or ""get into some very high-stakes policy and political engagements,"" said Dave Regan, who heads the SEIU's biggest local in California. He said he is prepared to spend $4 million starting next year to get the signatures needed and then $10 million to $20 million on the campaign in California.

It isn't uncommon for unions to wage negative public campaigns to win agreements from employers, including organizing accords. But experts say the SEIU appears to be ramping up the tactic by setting the stage for a direct appeal to voters.

The SEIU now represents about 90,000 of California's 400,000 hospital workers, in about a quarter of the state's 430 hospitals, according to the SEIU. In Oregon, the union represents about 6,000 of 60,000 hospital workers, in seven of the state's 59 hospitals, according to the hospital industry.

Mr. Regan denied the union filed the initiative proposals this month only as a lever to boost union membership. He said it wants a broad ""strategic partnership"" to lower costs, raise the quality of care—and have a path to organize workers. Hospital officials respond that the initiatives would cut revenue and affect care without addressing the drivers of health-care costs.

The potential showdown comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing the legality of pacts in which employers agree not to oppose union organizing, known as neutrality agreements. Some business groups say they violate labor laws that prohibit employers from giving a ""thing of value"" to a union. In many such agreements, including the case now before the high court involving another union and a gambling company, employers allow access to employees and stand aside during organizing. In turn, unions halt negative public campaigns or back political issues favored by employers.

Several justices have said they were troubled that an employer could offer neutrality in exchange for something of value from a union, such as a promise to fund a political campaign benefiting the employer.

In the SEIU's case, hospitals could be spared the cost of fighting the ballot initiatives if they agree to a partnership that includes neutrality, said Michael Lotito, a San Francisco lawyer who has represented hospitals against SEIU. ""The real 'thing of value' that the union offers is, 'I'm going to stop attacking you,' "" he said.

Unions argue the court challenge misapplies an anticorruption provision in the law and the agreements promote stability in labor-management relations.

The court's decision could have far-ranging implications. In recent years, the 1.9 million-member SEIU has bucked the nationwide trend in membership declines, in part by organizing thousands of health-care workers, security guards and janitors after negotiating neutrality agreements with companies.

The current tactic has been tried previously but not on such a large scale. The SEIU backed a ballot initiative last year that would have capped hospital executive pay in Mountain View, Calif., while it was in negotiations with a hospital there. But after the SEIU reached an agreement with the hospital, it pulled its support for the initiative; a spokesman for the union said it decided to focus on two statewide issues instead.

The Mountain View initiative passed anyway, but a judge threw the measure out, saying it couldn't be applied to local health-care districts.

A nurses union in Massachusetts pushing for better patient ratios now is gathering signatures for ballot initiatives in that state, including one that would fine any hospital receiving taxpayer funds if its CEO compensation exceeds 100 times that of the lowest-paid employee.

The California Hospital Association has told its members the SEIU filed the initiatives because it failed to get an agreement to organize workers in that state. On Nov. 12, Duane Dauner, head of the association, emailed its board, which includes CEOs of large and small hospital systems in the state, a proposal from the SEIU. It listed a total of 30,293 workers at 33 hospitals who would be organized in the first year, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

""There's no question that these measures have been put on the table to drive a conversation about organizing,"" said Andy Davidson, CEO of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems.

Steve Trossman, an SEIU spokesman, said that the union had made the organizing proposal to California hospitals, and that it was intended ""to show that if we were to reach a strategic partnership, that the numbers [of new union members] would be spread around.""

The SEIU threatened several California statewide ballot initiatives in 2012 but backed off when the California Hospital Association agreed to collaborate on several issues, according to a joint statement at the time. Since then, the groups have worked together on a bill to restore Medicare reimbursement rates for hospitals. The hospital association arranged meetings between the SEIU and hospital executives to discuss organizing issues, said Jan Emerson-Shea, a spokeswoman for the association.

""It became clear that the one thing they wanted we cannot do for them,"" she said. ""We cannot force hospitals to allow SEIU to come in and hold elections and remain neutral.""

Mr. Davidson, of the Oregon hospital association, said he has met once with SEIU officials since the initiatives were filed in late October, but he is also preparing to try to defeat the measures. He said the union has discussed organizing only broadly.

Meg Niemi, president of the Oregon SEIU local backing the initiatives in that state, said it hasn't otherwise been able to improve the affordability and quality of health care through cooperation with the industry. She said the union isn't seeking a neutrality agreement, but is interested in organizing members. ""The best way to be able to address these issues [of affordability and quality] is making sure that the folks that provide the care in the hospitals have a voice.""

Rhode Island Drops Sales Tax on Original Art,"Rhode Island, aiming to build on the success of some of its old industrial towns that have reinvented themselves as artists' enclaves, has become the first U.S. state to stop collecting sales tax on original and limited-edition art sold there.

""They just made the whole state an arts district,"" said Herb Weiss, who for the past 15 years has been recruiting artists to Pawtucket, R.I., as the city's economic and cultural affairs officer. Pawtucket has offered artists who work in a designated arts district a state-granted exemption from sales tax on original art since 1999. A Rhode Island law expanded the exemption to artists statewide on Sunday.

Mr. Weiss said that many of Pawtucket's 19th- and 20th-century mills, which were almost empty by the 1990s, are now filled with artists, recruited with the lure of low rents and the tax break. In the past 15 years, two theaters, a public school for the arts, a concert venue and two independent breweries have opened in Pawtucket, about 50 miles southwest of Boston.

Artists have to apply to the state to qualify for the sales-tax exemption. The hope is that the statewide exemption will bring a similar boost to all of Rhode Island and its art dealers, who have struggled since the recession.

Ellen Waxman's art gallery, Five Main, in Wickford, R.I. Ms. Waxman led the charge to expand the tax exemption for artworks statewide. Ellen Waxman/Five Main Gallery

""The art industry, more so than other industries, was hit hard by the economic downturn—art is a luxury item, so in bad times people don't spend money on luxury items,"" said Ellen Waxman, who has owned the Five Main art gallery in the seaside village of Wickford, R.I., for 16 years. Last year, Ms. Waxman suggested to a state senator that Rhode Island expand the sales-tax exemption, and led the charge for it.

Ms. Waxman said she didn't feel it was fair for an art gallery in her village, where there was no exemption, to be competing with galleries in cities like Pawtucket that had arts districts offering the tax break, which was originally intended for blighted areas. ""We're too small of a state to be pitting the different communities against each other,"" she said. Her shop sells seaside paintings and photographs by artists from the area and elsewhere.

Randall Rosenbaum, executive director of the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, said the new law requires regulators to document whether the program is successful or not. ""I think as we look down the road, we find opportunities to encourage more reclamation of old buildings for artists' studios and live-work spaces—we find opportunities to turn some of our industrial past into our artistic future,"" he said.

In 2008, Louisiana began a program modeled partly on Rhode Island's, offering state and local sales-tax exemptions for original visual art. Today, the state has 67 neighborhood cultural districts, 21 of them in New Orleans. Gaye Hamilton, the Louisiana program's manager, said she would eventually like to offer the tax exemption to other artists.

Italian Banks' Woes Hurt Small Firms,"SENIGALLIA, Italy— Pietro Fattorini, owner of a marble company in the eastern Italian region of Marche, recently filed for bankruptcy protection. But it isn't for lack of demand. The 23-year-old company he founded has plenty of orders from overseas clients.

Mr. Fattorini's problem is much closer to home. His longtime bank, Banca Marche, lost more than €750 million ($1.01 billion) in 2012 and the first half of this year. As a result, the bank cut his credit lines last year, choking off the funds he needs to survive.

""It's like starting to drive on the motorway without knowing if you'll find gas stations on the way,"" he said.

The woes of smaller banks like Banca Marche are washing over the millions of small Italian businesses that depend on them for financing. Moreover, the deep ties the banks have to Italy's small towns mean that the consequent losses in banking jobs, share prices and even charitable donations weigh heavily on some local communities.

Small and midtier banks like Banca Marche account for about half of overall lending in the country. In turn, Italian companies rely on banks for about 70% of their funding, more than double the rate in the U.K. or U.S., according to Bank of Italy data.

Banca Marche declined to comment. In a statement in August on its first-half results, the bank said it was working to reduce the risk attached to its loan portfolio and that the decline in lending was mainly due to the difficult macroeconomic environment and the consequent lower demand by companies.

In recent months, the Bank of Italy, concerned about soaring rates of bad loans amid Italy's worst recession since World War II, placed 13 banks under ""special administration,"" a process whereby the central bank appoints commissioners to run troubled lenders. A Bank of Italy spokeswoman said the commissioners are involved in lending decisions, though she denied there is any link between special administration and a reduction in credit to small and medium-size firms.

""The only financing possibility for Marche's companies—around 95% of them are [small and medium-size enterprises]—is self-financing or credit,"" said Donato Iacobucci, an economist who works at the Università Politecnica of Marche.

The Bank of Italy spokeswoman said the central bank doesn't require a lender under special administration to rein in lending. ""For sure, the presence of the commissioners ensures that credit is granted on the basis of a correct evaluation of the creditworthiness of borrowers,"" the spokeswoman said.

Bad loans in Italy have risen 35% since the end of 2011, while lending to Italian companies has fallen 5% during the same period, banking association ABI said. Italian bank loans declined 3.7%, to €1.857 trillion, in the first 10 months of this year, compared with a 1% drop in the same period last year.

The credit crunch has weighed particularly heavily on small companies, which make up more than 90% of all firms in Italy and typically lack other sources of funding, such as selling bonds to investors. Lack of credit is proving the coup de grace for many Italian companies that are already suffering a slump in demand.

Bankruptcies in Italy are at a 10-year peak, with more than 62,000 Italian companies going bust in the first nine months of this year, according to research company Cerved, a 7.3% increase from the same period in 2012 and a 57% rise from 10 years earlier.

Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena BMPS -1.90% SpA, which has lost €8.5 billion in the past three years, has become the poster child of the domino effect a bank's troubles have on a local community. The bank, once a major employer and the leading lender in its home region of Siena, is cutting thousands of jobs, trimming lending and reining in spending on local groups.

A similar situation is unfolding in Marche, a region once known for its vibrant shoe and furniture industries.

Banca Marche was once the region's leading lender, with one-fourth of all loans, but many of its small-business clients started struggling to repay loans, especially those in the real-estate sector. Bankruptcies among companies in Marche rose 9.3% in the first nine months of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to Cerved. In response, Banca Marche has cut the total amount of loans 12% since 2011.

For years, Banca Marche extended an €800,000 credit line to Mr. Fattorini, secured by his invoices. But while his company's revenue has increased 20% since 2008, the bank cut that the credit line to €150,000, demanded collateral and added a commission for the first time. That pushed the 47-year-old entrepreneur into bankruptcy protection in September.

""I don't know what I'll do"" once the company is wound down, he said. ""Maybe I'll go abroad.""

Claudio Mercorelli, who manages a furniture manufacturer in Marche, also stopped receiving credit lines from Banca Marche he relies on for working capital. ""We can't go on working like this. What's worse is that when you speak to the banks they don't give you any explanation. They say these are the orders they received,"" he said. He is now scrambling to find other banks that can finance his company.

The banks' problems are spreading in other ways as well. Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara SpA, which came under special administration by the Bank of Italy in May, stopped paying a dividend to its controlling shareholder, charitable foundation Fondazione Carife, in 2010. The dividend allowed the foundation to spend about €75 million over the previous decade on local projects, ranging from church restorations to the creation of a new economics department at the Università di Ferrara.

But the foundation depleted most of its reserves to underwrite a 2008 capital increase launched by the bank. Now, with the dividend also suspended, the foundation's charitable giving has dried up, with grants declining from €7.6 million in 2008 to €1.9 million in 2012.

Meanwhile, people who piled into shares offered by Banca Popolare di Spoleto SpA could lose a lifetime of savings after the stock plunged 63% in the past three years.

The bank had pushed the shares to customers, as did Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara. Consumer association Federconsumatori has fielded hundreds of complaints from small shareholders, claiming they weren't properly informed about the risk of such investments.

The association is considering whether to take legal action against Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara after a 75% drop in the stock since January. Cassa di Risparmio di Ferrara and Banca Popolare di Spoleto didn't reply to requests for comment.
