5 Fashion Resolutions for 2016,"Illustration: Kiersten Essenpreis

NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS? I don’t need no stinkin’ resolutions, I thought when my editor suggested I write a piece about my fashion-focused goals for 2016. Thanks, but I haven’t spent nearly two decades working in fashion without sorting out my style. (Insert Liz Lemon eye roll GIF here.)

I soon reconsidered that smug reaction. Pride goeth before the fall. Resolution One: Stop being a know-it-all. I’ve seen it happen: A fashion editor becomes so rigid in her personal edicts that she free-falls straight into a black, 100% cashmere rut. Resolution Two: I will let—nay, encourage—myself to make a mistake. Fashion should be fun, even a little messy. This year I will indulge in a wild-card purchase, maybe one of Sacai’s bandana-print dresses for Spring 2016, which I loved at first sight even if my internal naysayer told me the dresses might look dated sooner than my many, many gray sweaters.

In the spirit of rule-breaking-as-resolution, I decided to review other self-imposed restrictions. Resolution Three: Stop shunning the low-price fast fashion at Zara and H&M . As part of my maternity wardrobe (I’m at 32 weeks and counting), I bought a couple of knit dresses from Zara and was impressed with the quality. The dresses didn’t strike me as disposable and therefore wasteful—one of my key beefs with fast fashion. I hope to wear them post-natally, unless my bump has unalterably distorted their shape. Plus, both companies have made efforts to be more ethical and sustainable with their supply chains. On my next H&M visit, I may take a bag of old clothes for the company’s Garment Collecting Initiative, which recycles used pieces.

Another old rule—Don’t buy any high-end designer item unless I truly love it—also called for re-examining. The price of women’s designer fashion has become astronomical. Though borderline justified in the case of, say, a heavily embroidered dress, these prices often feel arbitrary. Take the women’s navy blazer in Saint Laurent’s permanent collection: At $3,190, it costs over $700 more than the nearly identical men’s version. I should be seeking creative workarounds. Resolution Four: My next piece of tailoring will be made bespoke. I’m certain I can get a beautiful navy blazer made custom for less than $3,000.

Speaking of value, it’s interesting how many of us who work in the fashion industry are desensitized to hefty price tags, with one curious proviso. Many of my colleagues find a $3,000 blazer acceptable, yet might balk at buying similarly priced fine jewelry, which they dismiss as an indulgence. I question this: A lovely bit of bijoux not only lasts, well, forever, its impact on your ensemble far outweighs its size. Ergo, Resolution Five: Instead of that blazer splurge, maybe I will buy a small piece of fine jewelry. Then again, who am I kidding? What’s most likely topping my budget for 2016 is onesies, Exersaucers and the best nanny I can find.",REAL
Defenders of Confederate Symbols Mount a Counterattack,"An honor guard from the South Carolina Highway patrol lowering a Confederate battle flag as it is removed from the Capitol grounds in Columbia, S.C., on July 10, 2015. John Bazemore/Associated Press 1 of 9 • • • • •

ATLANTA—Not since at least the civil-rights movement have Americans challenged the South’s Confederate symbols as fervently as they did in 2015.

The June massacre of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., by a believed white supremacist “opened the floodgates,” said John W. Adams, spokesman for the Florida Sons of Confederate Veterans.

Since then, officials in South Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, Florida and elsewhere removed or took steps to dismantle flags and other symbols from the region’s secessionist past.

In June, South Carolina’s Republican Gov. Nikki Haley, flanked by other political leaders in her state, called for removal of a Confederate battle flag flying in front of the state Capitol. “A hundred and fifty years after the end of the Civil War the time has come,” she said to loud applause. The flag came down July 10.

Alabama’s Republican Gov. Robert Bentley also ordered Confederate flags taken down at that state’s Capitol, and the University of Texas at Austin removed a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis from the campus’s South Mall.

Because of demographic shifts, many Southerners have altered attitudes toward once-sacrosanct tributes to the Confederacy. The 11 states that made up the former Confederacy grew to a total population of over 102 million in 2014, from 84.2 million in 2000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, a 21% increase, compared with a 13% overall U.S. growth rate. Southern states’ ethnic and racial composition has evolved significantly, with black, Hispanic and Asian minorities growing.

Sharon Brown, a 43-year-old African-American activist who has launched an effort to remove the Confederate battle emblem—the “Southern Cross”—from the Mississippi flag, said that her work brought hundreds of supporters to march through Jackson calling for the change. Several cities and colleges in the state have already removed the flag.

Her work also brought nasty phone calls to her home, with strangers yelling “the normal ignorant remarks,” she said. “Change is never easy.”

Opposition to tossing all things Confederate into history’s dust bin now is growing. Heritage supporters are lobbying legislators, and their lawyers are preparing lawsuits, in efforts to restore or maintain Confederate monuments.

“We’re seeing a resurgence, a counterbalance” from people who wish to honor the region’s Confederate heritage, said Mr. Adams, whose heritage group opposes the removals.

Confederate heritage groups say that membership and donations are up; and Confederate flags unfurled on trucks or waving in front of homes remain a common sight across much of the rural South.

Dewey Barber, owner of Confederate flag retailer Dixie Outfitters, in Odum, Ga., said sales have “overwhelmed” his company last summer and fall. Many flags are out of stock as suppliers rush to fill orders, he said. “It’s off the charts.”

The stage is set for political skirmishes in 2016.

In New Orleans, the city council approved Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s plan to remove Confederate monuments, citing public nuisance laws. But monument supporters gathered thousands of signatures of support and filed a lawsuit in federal court to halt the plan.

In Georgia, a battle erupted at Stone Mountain, a granite outcropping east of Atlanta that bears 90-foot-tall likenesses of Confederate leaders chiseled in its side. The association that runs the state park proposed in October to place a “freedom bell” monument in honor of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. atop the mountain, as a feel-good gesture.

But a local NAACP leader called the idea “a ploy” and said setting such a monument amid a park honoring the Confederacy would be an insult to the Rev. King, unless all Confederate flags and place names were removed. State law explicitly requires rebel flags at the park. Leaders of the Georgia Sons of Confederate Veterans blasted the proposed additions as “disrespectful” changes to undermine the park’s purpose: to honor their ancestors who fought.

Bill Stephens, chief executive of the park association, said the group put the Rev. King tribute idea “on the back burner,” adding: “We were surprised that both sides were so against it.”

Even in South Carolina, where the flag in front of the Capitol came down so dramatically, Confederate heritage is stirring controversy.

Some legislators voted for the flag’s removal only after they were assured it would be put on exhibit in a state-run museum. The state commission this December proposed the cost of such an exhibit to be about $3.6 million, down from $5.3 million initially proposed by architectural consultants. The General Assembly will take up the issue in January.

Police Contracts Draw New Scrutiny After Shootings,"A police officer stands guard at a march in December calling for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images

CHICAGO—Less than a month after a Chicago police officer killed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in a hail of 16 gunshots, the City Council wrapped up a new contract with the police union.

The pact, reached last year, was lauded by aldermen as a sign of cooperation between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and union leaders as the city faced financial problems. What wasn’t mentioned was the added protections it provides officers who are under investigation for misconduct, including new rules for interrogations and video evidence.

Nationally, such protections have been building in union contracts and state law for decades. But they are starting to be challenged in the wake of high-profile police killings of civilians, which sparked calls for greater accountability.

The release in November of a graphic video showing the shooting of Mr. McDonald has Chicago aldermen re-examining the police contract and calling for changes in its disciplinary sections.

Scrutiny of the police intensified after a double fatal shooting by officers last week. The dead included a 55-year-old black woman who was mistakenly hit.

Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake pushed last year for an overhaul of Maryland’s so-called officers’ bill of rights. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo blocked legislation that would have allowed officers including those in New York City to negotiate rules for discipline—preserving New York’s rare status as a state that doesn’t allow such issues be subject to bargaining.

Meantime, activists tied to Black Lives Matter, which grew out of the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, launched a campaign in recent weeks to put a focus on police contracts.

“The wake-up call is there. It is unfortunate it took a kid being executed,” said Chicago Alderman John Arena, referring to the McDonald shooting.

Hours before the video’s release—which shows Officer Jason Van Dyke shooting Mr. McDonald until he slumps to the ground—prosecutors charged Mr. Van Dyke with murder. The officer pleaded not guilty this week.

The video sparked widespread protests and led Mr. Emanuel to oust Chicago’s police superintendent and replace the head of the city’s Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates allegations of police misconduct and shootings by officers in Chicago. The U.S. Justice Department launched a broad investigation of departmental practices, and Mr. Emanuel named his own task force.

Across the country, union contracts and state laws, commonly in the form of “officers’ bill of rights,” provide special protections for police in misconduct investigations and disciplinary proceedings. The protections, sought by unions to insulate officers from political whims and complaints often made by those arrested, can include such things as setting due process rules for an investigation to the length of time disciplinary records can be kept.

“From the rank and file point of view, it’s really important to us,” said William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, which represents about 240,000 officers. “Especially in the last 18 months with the scrutiny of police officers, we really have to do something in there that provides some minimal due process to say, ‘Hey, is this a valid claim?’ ”

Samuel Walker, professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska Omaha, said such protections have gone too far, citing provisions such as giving officers accused of misconduct up to 10 days before they can be questioned.

In most cities, police rules on disciplinary investigations are set in negotiations along with wages, seniority and benefits. Such cost issues tend to grab the attention of elected officials and the public. The result: “The city trades away some management issues for settlement on the financial ones,” Mr. Walker said.

Under the Chicago police contract, officers can refuse a polygraph test and disciplinary records are required to be destroyed after five years.

Language added in the most recent contract states that investigators can show an officer video evidence before taking his or her statement, a practice critics say taints witness accounts and can result in statements being tailored to video evidence. Officers also may “clarify and amend” statements made before they view video evidence.

The Emanuel administration said the new language doesn’t prevent officers from being disciplined for filing a false report. Union officials said they sought to prevent what they described as playing gotcha with an officer’s career.

Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has long examined police misconduct in Chicago, said allowing officers to see video evidence runs counter to basic investigatory practices.

“That should raise eyebrows because it’s a double standard,” he said.

In Chicago, the current discipline system has been criticized as ineffective. Data from the Independent Police Review Authority, created in 2007 to investigate police shootings and misconduct allegations, show officers have been cleared in all but two of the 409 shootings it examined.

Chicago paid out nearly $250 million in police misconduct judgments and settlements over the last five years, more on a per officer basis than the 10 other cities with the largest police departments, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.

Lorenzo Davis, a former police officer who went on to investigate cases for the Review Authority, alleges in a lawsuit that he was fired after refusing to rule that certain police shootings were justified.

“It became really pro-police and I was accused of being biased against police because I was not as pro- police,” Mr. Davis said.

A spokesman for the authority declined to comment on Mr. Davis’ suit, calling it a personnel matter.

Trimming Prison Populations Catches On,"The geriatric unit the Utah State Prison in Draper. Photo: Rick Bowmer/ASSOCIATED PRESS

Two years ago, Utah was considering whether to knock down its largest prison and build a bigger one. Instead, it decided to knock down the laws that were filling it up.

In an ambitious experiment in criminal justice, the conservative state’s legislators passed a law that reduced drug penalties, lowered sentencing guidelines and scaled back punishment for parole violations that had been sending offenders back to prison in droves last year.

Utah officials hope the law will halt the state’s prison growth and save more than $500 million over 20 years, without sacrificing public safety. But some criminal-justice experts and law-enforcement officials question whether states can, in the long run, keep crime down while emptying prisons.

“The proof is going to be in the data and the results,” said John King, chief of police in Provo and a member of a state commission that came up with Utah’s new policy. “If it doesn’t work out, we can go back and make harsher laws.”

Republican Gov. Gary Herbert in 2014 called for a broad review of Utah’s criminal justice policies. The Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice—made up of ​judges, law-enforcement officials, lawmakers and others—responded with a wide-ranging proposal that included, controversially, classifying first and second convictions for drug possession as misdemeanors instead of felonies.

More than 30 states have adjusted their laws and policies to try to restrain prison populations since 2007. Lawmakers and advocates for reducing the prison population and others in the criminal-justice field expect the trend to continue in 2016.

The wave of state law changes has influenced thinking of federal legislators.

Sen. Charles Grassley, (R., Iowa) chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he introduced the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, after studying state laws in Georgia and Texas, where legislators were “doing some interesting things to reduce recidivism as well as the burden on the taxpayer while lowering the crime rate.”

The federal bill, which has been approved by judiciary committees in both chambers with bipartisan support, would cut mandatory minimum drug and gun sentences and allow many federal prisoners to earn credits toward early release for completing rehabilitative programs in prison. It is likely to see a vote in Congress this year.

Lawmakers from both major parties believe that high rates of recidivism are a drain on resources and as evidence of the failure of prisons to rehabilitate. Utah and several other states have allocated more money for rehabilitation programs, as they have eased penalties. Officials in Alaska, Maryland, Oklahoma and Rhode Island also have signaled their desire for overhauls.

A study of prisoners from 30 states released in 2005 by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the research arm of the Justice Department, found that about two-thirds of them were arrested for a new crime within three years, and three-quarters were arrested within five years.

The Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice, with the help of Pew Charitable Trusts, found that offenders sent back to prison for violating parole and probation represented two-thirds of all prison admissions in 2013. Utah also was sending more offenders to prison for drug possession than any other new crime, and time served in prison had increased for all offenders by 18% since 2004.

In addition to lowering sentencing guidelines, the new state law reduces inmates’ sentences if they participate in treatment and creates escalating sanctions for parole violations short of sending an offender back to prison.

Critics of reducing penalties for crime point to upticks in homicides in dozens of major cities in 2015. “If you shorten sentences, you are going to have people coming out earlier and going back to crime earlier,” said Heather Mac Donald, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank.

Don Mihalek, who represents Secret Service members in the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, also cautioned against applying state overhauls to the federal system. “States deal with predominantly low-level street crimes—drugs, guns and domestic assaults,” he said. “In the federal system you’re looking at large-scale criminal organizations, gangs, high-level money laundering.”

It is too soon to tell what effect Utah’s changes will have on its prison population or its crime rate. But state officials said they plan to relocate the main prison, which has about 3,800 inmates, without expanding it.

"Ten Years After Blowup, Amaranth Investors Waiting to Get Money Back","Amaranth offices in Greenwich Conn., in 2006. Photo: Douglas Healey/Associated Press

Amaranth Advisors was one of the biggest hedge-fund blowups in history. Now, the fallen fund is approaching a new milestone: a decadelong wait to give investors back what remains of their money.

When Amaranth collapsed in September 2006 after bad multibillion-dollar bets on natural gas, investors were told redemptions would be temporarily suspended for two months.

The break has been considerably longer. Last week, investors were told redemptions would remain frozen through December 2016, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

It wasn’t immediately clear what was left to be returned by the once-$9 billion firm or why the delay had been so prolonged. The notice to investors reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and dated Dec. 24 noted only “the assets of the portfolios of the fund and the master fund will continue to be managed in order to effect an orderly wind down.”

The notice was sent from a Delray Beach, Fla., office suite, and calls to a phone number listed on the letter wouldn’t connect.

More than 90% of the set-aside investments in the main fund have been paid back, and a slice of what remains is cash or cash equivalents, a person familiar with the matter said. The stakes were recently offered on a secondary marketplace for around 50 cents on the dollar, another person said.

A portion of the remaining money belongs to Nick Maounis, the Amaranth founder who now runs an unrelated hedge-fund firm, a person familiar said. Mr. Maounis didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP continues to work on valuing the remaining assets, the person said. An Ernst & Young spokeswoman wasn’t immediately able to comment.

Amaranth once was among the largest hedge funds in the world but it imploded in 2006 when its 32-year-old chief energy trader lost $5 billion in a week betting on natural-gas investments with borrowed money.

Related litigation from investors and regulators pressed on for years. In 2014, the trader settled with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and agreed to pay a $750,000 fine and be banned from trading all CFTC-regulated natural-gas products.

The practice of blocking the exits has been rare since 2008, but in recent months some managers have stopped short of immediately paying back money investors asked to withdraw.

Third Avenue Management’s risky Focused Credit fund suspended redemptions earlier in December amid heavy losses, shocking investors and analysts with a move nearly unheard-of since the financial crisis. That followed a refusal by Claren Road Asset Management, the struggling hedge fund owned by Carlyle Group, to hand back the sum of their requested withdrawals this fall.

Stone Lion Capital Partners LP also took a similar move in its main hedge fund.

All three, which focus on relatively hard-to-trade credit instruments, have said they intend to pay back investors eventually, though they have yet to provide dates for the full return.

"Floodwaters Recede Near St. Louis, as Thousands Start Cleanup","Massive flooding struck the Midwest at the end of December, stopping just shy of breaking 30-year records. Photo: Camp Jessop Studios

As floodwaters in the St. Louis area receded Friday and roadways were reopened, officials in Missouri turned to assessing the damage to properties and infrastructure and beginning what promised to be a slow recovery process for many.

Downstream areas remained on alert. Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner activated National Guard troops Friday in case they were needed to assist communities in the southern part of the state where floodwaters were expected to rise through the weekend.

“Local communities continue to battle rising floodwaters and the state stands ready to assist as needed,” the Gov. Rauner said.

Meanwhile, the number of flood-related deaths in Missouri climbed to 15 on Friday, after the body of a man was found close to where a motorist went missing on Dec. 26.

In the coming days and weeks, a large volume of water will work its way south toward New Orleans, causing potential disruptions to communities and commercial traffic. On Friday, the U.S. Coast Guard issued a high-water safety advisory on the Mississippi River as far south as Natchez, Miss.

But, weather officials said, as of right now, the highest flood risk had already passed. The primary reason for the reduced risk is that the capacity of the Mississippi, the nation’s biggest river, increases after the Ohio River feeds into it at Cairo, Ill.

“The river is deeper and wider. It can carry a lot more water,” said Mark Fuchs, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in St. Louis. He said the flooding won’t affect communities and states downstream as much as it had in the St. Louis area.

The rare winter flood from heavy rains that fell after the Christmas holiday took a steep toll on a wide section of the Midwest, leaving at least 22 dead in Missouri and Illinois. The same storm had ravaged towns in Texas and Oklahoma with tornadoes and blizzard conditions before pushing north. Most flood-related deaths occurred when people drove into rising waters.

The most serious flooding occurred on the Meramec River, a tributary that flows into the Mississippi River south of St. Louis. The smaller river rose to about 46 feet along towns such as Pacific, Eureka and Valley Park, 4 feet above the highest flood stage recorded previously. Most levees held, but water found its way past unprotected areas, forcing thousands of people to evacuate.

On Friday, highways in the St. Louis region were reopened, and crews were cleaning debris from roadways. State and city officials were canvassing business owners to see what kind of assistance they need to reopen and farmers were assessing damage to fields.

Prosecutors Seek Ex-Reporter’s Testimony,"John Miller, right, an NYPD official, with Mayor Bill de Blasio in October. Prosecutors want the former reporter’s testimony for a terror trial. Associated Press

A former reporter who is now a government official plans to testify at an upcoming terrorism trial about his reporting on al Qaeda—a new wrinkle in the continuing debate over whether the Justice Department has intruded on press freedoms.

John Miller, who is now the deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism at the New York Police Department, has been preparing to testify about his conversations surrounding a 1998 interview he conducted with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, according to people close to the case.

Federal prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in New York want his testimony as they try to convict Khaled al-Fawwaz of conspiring to kill Americans with twin bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

The seeking of evidence from reporters has become a hot-button issue, particularly after leak investigations involving reporters at the Associated Press, the New York Times and Fox News Channel forced the Justice Department earlier this year to revisit and rewrite some of its rules on how it gathers evidence about reporters. Attorney General Eric Holder is still working on further revisions to the department’s policies, which could be announced in the coming weeks, according to people involved in those discussions.

Next week, New York Times reporter James Risen is scheduled to appear in a federal court in Virginia to answer limited questions under oath, ahead of a planned trial of an ex-Central Intelligence Agency employee accused of sharing national security information. After a lengthy court battle, prosecutors in that case have signaled they won't try to force Mr. Risen to identify his sources.

In the New York terror trial due to begin this month, there were no such contentious exchanges between prosecutors and Mr. Miller, the former reporter for ABC News, according to people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Miller has agreed to testify voluntarily, according to people familiar with the case. A spokeswoman for ABC News declined to comment.

Though the full scope of his testimony is still unclear, Mr. Miller has written, both in a book and a magazine article, about meeting Mr. Fawwaz and negotiating with him and others for an interview with bin Laden. He wrote he visited Mr. Fawwaz’s house outside London. Those discussions eventually led to a May 1998 interview with the terror leader in Afghanistan. That interview took place a few months before the attack on the U.S. embassies in Africa.

Prosecutors have also sought testimony from a CBS producer who sought to arrange an interview with bin Laden around the same time, though the producer has indicated he doesn’t want to testify, according to people close to the case.

Mr. Fawwaz, according to U.S. prosecutors, helped create the terror cell network in Africa that eventually bombed the embassies. In 1994, he moved to London where he led a group of men handling bin Laden’s public relations work, helping spread a 1996 fatwa declaring war on America, authorities say. For more than a decade, Mr. Fawwaz fought extradition to the U.S. Mr. Fawwaz has pleaded not guilty.

Debate Over U.S. Government Surveillance Faces a Deadline,"Edward Snowden talks via satellite at the New Yorker Festival in October. Ever since revelations about government surveillance by the former NSA contractor in 2013, a number of lawmakers have called for ending the NSA’s bulk collection of phone records. Associated Press

WASHINGTON—A debate over the reach of U.S. surveillance networks heads unresolved into 2015, after calls for drastic spying limits were blunted by the recent surge in global extremism, but a statutory deadline looms at midyear.

Key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire in June after attempts to modify the Sept. 11-era national security law were stymied in the Senate in 2014. Now, the incoming Republican-dominated Congress faces a variety of tensions as it works to sort out the future of U.S. surveillance programs.

Civil-liberties advocates and many lawmakers want stricter protocols for gathering information—in particular, limits on the mass collection of phone records by the National Security Agency—while opponents of such measures cite security threats that they maintain warrant the continuation of the bulk accumulation of personal data.

At the same time, businesses scarred by their compliance with government surveillance programs have grown more vocal in advocating greater oversight and transparency, and have worked to secure their systems against government encroachment. They face off with warnings from the FBI and other agencies about the public-safety dangers of limited law-enforcement access to public phone and Internet records.

In the midst of the debate, important parts of the Patriot Act, including Section 215, which authorizes phone-records collection, are due to expire, thrusting a difficult choice on lawmakers and the Obama administration: reauthorize the law in some form or risk losing the legal basis for key intelligence programs.

“The House is not going to pass a straight reauthorization, and I don’t think President Obama would support one,” said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program, and a supporter of privacy protections. “Something has to happen and there has to be some kind of reform, and the question is: What does it look like?”

Ever since revelations about government surveillance by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in June 2013, a number of lawmakers in both parties have called for ending the NSA’s bulk collection of phone records and revamping other surveillance activities. But Senate Republicans blocked a bill in November to alter existing programs because they thought it went too far and would have hindered efforts to combat extremism.

The legislation was backed by a broad and unusual coalition, including the White House, technology companies, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association. Supporters of restructuring existing programs say there is room for compromise in 2015.

“Those of us who believe we should reform our surveillance authorities and those who prefer the status quo have a shared interest in negotiating a way forward that preserves our ability to protect the nation from attack while protecting privacy and civil liberties interests,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee.

Businesses are increasingly a part of the debate. Apple Inc., Google Inc. and other technology companies put new encryption technology in place this year to make their devices and services more secure and meet customer demands to protect personal information. Concerns that tech companies too willingly turn over data to the U.S. government cost them business overseas, they say.

“If you’re a European right now, you’re less likely to trust an American firm to retain your data,” Eric Schmidt, Google’s chairman, said at a recent Cato Institute conference in Washington.

The tension between personal privacy and national security in next year’s Congress will extend to areas beyond the looming deadline for the Patriot Act, as companies and the government seek to shore up cyberdefenses.

High-profile hacks on Sony Corp.’s movie and TV studio arm and others this past year, including Home Depot Inc., likely will renew a push for legislation to enable information-sharing about malicious malware and cyberthreats between intelligence agencies and the private sector, after such an effort failed in 2014. Absent such a measure, companies fear they could be subject to lawsuits from making such disclosures.

Opponents of the bill worry it would grant the NSA greater access to personal information. Supporters, including intelligence officials, industry groups and many lawmakers, say computer networks will remain at risk until the public and private sector can readily share such information. With an information-sharing law “you could stop a lot of problems,” said Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Mich.), outgoing chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

U.S. Watch: News Digest,"Earthquake Off Coast Shakes Part of State

The U.S. Geological Survey has downgraded an earthquake off the northern coast of the state to a magnitude-5.1 shaker.

The quake was centered in the Pacific Ocean, about 70 miles west of Ferndale, and struck at 4:16 a.m. Thursday. It originally was logged as a magnitude-5.3 temblor, the USGS said.

The Victorian village of Ferndale is about 100 miles south of the Oregon state line and about 275 miles northwest of Sacramento.

An officer with the Ferndale City Police Department said some slight shaking was felt in the area early Thursday, but no damage or injuries were reported.

The earthquake was about 250 miles northwest of the epicenter of a magnitude-6.0 temblor that caused extensive damage in Napa and the surrounding area on Aug. 24.

Probe Into Youth’s Shooting May Be Moved

The city of Cleveland is hoping to hand over the investigation of a 12-year-old boy’s fatal shooting by police to an outside agency, as well as future probes of all deadly use-of-force cases.

Michael McGrath, the city’s public safety director and its former police chief, has been in talks with Cuyahoga County officials for the sheriff’s office to handle the inquiry, city spokesman Dan Ball said.

For now, Cleveland police investigators are collecting evidence and conducting interviews related to the Nov. 22 shooting of Tamir Rice. The boy was carrying an airsoft gun that shoots nonlethal plastic pellets when a rookie officer shot him at a playground.

Surveillance video released by police shows Tamir being shot less than two seconds after the patrol car stopped near him. Officer Timothy Loehmann told the boy to put his hands up, but he didn’t, according to police.

Judge: Clerks Should Issue Same-Sex Licenses

A federal judge said the state’s county court clerks have a legal duty to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but he stopped short of ordering them to do so.

U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle issued a ruling Thursday in Tallahassee federal court responding to requests to clarify his previous order that the state’s same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. He stayed that order, but the stay is set to expire at the end of Monday.

The association representing county clerks says the ruling applies only to Washington County, where a lawsuit filed by two men became a key basis for his order. Gay-rights groups say the order applies statewide.

Judge Hinkle warned Thursday that clerks who don’t start issuing the licenses when the stay expires could face future suits or other legal consequences. He said while his order doesn’t require a clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, “the Constitution requires the clerk to issue such licenses.”

The National Center for Lesbian Rights and American Civil Liberties Union in Florida cheered Hinkle’s ruling Thursday.

“We expect all clerks to respect the ruling. But if not, we are committed to ensuring marriage equality in all 67 counties in Florida and we would like to hear from any couples that are wrongfully denied a license after the stay expires,” said Daniel Tilley, an attorney on LGBT rights for the ACLU of Florida.

An Associated Press survey of Florida’s county clerks last week found that an overwhelming majority didn’t plan to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples starting Tuesday until they had further legal clarity.

In a brief filed early last week, The attorney general’s office has said Judge Hinkle should “provide appropriate clarification” if he wants the ruling to apply beyond Washington County. The brief also argued that clerks are independent officials under Florida’s constitution and that Hinkle’s initial ruling took aim at other statewide officials under Gov. Rick Scott who are not connected to clerks.

While awaiting Hinkle’s clarification, a handful of Florida county clerks said they would stop offering courthouse wedding ceremonies, partly to avoid performing those ceremonies for same-sex couples.

"Labor, Marijuana and Pets to Get New Laws in 2015","An employee helps customers with their purchase of marijuana at a store in Denver. In 2015, Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia join Colorado and Washington in legalizing recreational pot use. Bloomberg News

The minimum wage is rising in dozens of states, college students in California will test the meaning of “Yes means yes,” recreational pot smokers will gain three more safe havens, and New Yorkers will be banned from piercing or tattooing their pets.

Among the many laws taking effect in 2015, labor laws, in particular, will sprout like weeds. Minimum-wage increases will take effect in at least 25 states, both Democratic- and Republican-leaning.

“It’s very hard, regardless of your party, to go back to voters and say, ‘I think $7.25 per hour is anything anyone can survive on,’ ” said Jonathan Segal, a partner at law firm Duane Morris LLP, referring to the wage floor in many states. “There are proposals [to increase the minimum wage] in virtually every state.”

Federal contractors, meanwhile, will see their minimum wage rise to $10.10 from $7.25 an hour, thanks to an executive order.

Other new labor rules include restrictions on employers’ use of criminal-background checks that will go into force in Illinois, Maryland and New Jersey, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, a trade group.

In November, voters in Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia approved the use of recreational marijuana, promising a happy, if not necessarily healthy, New Year for some. They joined Colorado and Washington, whose voters did the same in 2012.

The D.C. law stands apart. Congress, which maintains influence over the district, prohibited the use of public funds to create a system for regulating and taxing the sale of marijuana. But residents can grow and possess marijuana for personal use, creating what Mark A.R. Kleiman, a public policy professor at University of California, Los Angeles, described as an interesting experiment.

Some proponents of marijuana legalization argue that states must set up a commercial market to displace the illicit market for pot. “So now the question is, how much of the illicit market gets displaced by people treating pot like tomatoes?” Prof. Kleiman said.

In California, colleges that receive state funds for student aid will be bound by a new law meant to curb sexual assault. The law demands that students enter into an “affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity” that is “ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time.” The provision is known as the “Yes means yes” rule, a play on the anti-rape slogan “No means no.”

Critics of the law say it too broadly defines sexual assault and reduces sex to a contract negotiation. But Sherry Colb, a professor at Cornell University Law School who supports the law, said there are no dotted lines. An indication of interest, whether physical or verbal, is enough to satisfy the law’s requirement, she said. “What it guards against is the situation where someone is just frozen or not moving or staring into space and the other person takes that as an indication of consent,” she said.

New York public universities have adopted a similar rule and several states are considering legislation like California’s.

The only state gun-control measure put to voters in the 2014 elections expanded background checks in gun purchases in Washington.

Federal law requires licensed dealers to conduct background check on buyers; the Washington law—the eighth in the country—extends the background-check requirement to most sales and transfers involving an unlicensed party. President Barack Obama supported federal legislation that would do the same but was thwarted by gun-rights groups.

Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment scholar who supports the background checks, said the Washington law highlights the “new gun control movement’s strategy of state-by-state reform”—a strategy that gun-rights groups have long deployed. “Federal reform failed, but the gun-control movement hasn’t had this much energy in decades,” he said.

Animal-rights groups have also enjoyed support at the state level. In New York, Assembly member Linda B. Rosenthal introduced a bill banning New Yorkers from piercing or tattooing their pets. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed her legislation into law in December.

“The animal has no say, so the fact that you want to project your own fashion sense or your aesthetic ideas and cause them pain while doing it is not acceptable,” said Ms. Rosenthal.

Illinois may set a trend with a new law barring tiny plastic microbeads found in hand soaps and exfoliating washes. It goes into effect in the New Year.

Supporters of the law say such beads have collected in Lake Michigan and other bodies of water, presenting a danger to aquatic life. The ban will be rolled out in the coming years, prohibiting the manufacture and then the sale of products containing the beads.

Juveniles Sexually Abused by Staffers at Corrections Facilities,"In a federal survey of juvenile inmates, about 90% of youth who said they were victimized by staff were males reporting sexual activity with female staff. Zusha Elinson/The Wall Street Journal

NAMPA, Idaho—When a local nurse’s son was sent to the juvenile corrections center here at age 15, she was upset, but relieved that he would be away from drugs and gangs. The single mother said that the “night he went in, I felt bad, but I could sleep because he was safe.”

But within months, the head of security at the state juvenile corrections center in Nampa struck up a sexual relationship with the teenager, according to police reports. Julie McCormick admitted to having sex with him three times in 2012 while he was incarcerated, the reports said.

Ms. McCormick, 29 years old at the time, told detectives that she fell in love with the boy nearly half her age. She pleaded guilty in 2013 to lewd conduct with the minor and was sentenced to five to 20 years in prison in 2014. A lawyer who represented Ms. McCormick declined to comment.

“You hear about the Boy Scouts, you hear about the Catholic Church—those kids can walk away from it,” said his mother. “My son couldn’t.”

The scandal is an instance of an issue plaguing juvenile facilities nationwide.

National inmate surveys show juveniles experience a rate of sexual victimization by staff that is more than three times that of adult prisoners. Nearly 10% of youth held in state juvenile facilities reported incidents of sexual victimization, with more than 80% of those incidents involving staff, according to a national survey of juvenile inmates published by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013 that covered the preceding year.

“Youth are exceedingly vulnerable to being victimized in custodial settings,” said Brenda Smith, a professor at American University Washington College of Law who directs the Project on Addressing Prison Rape.

The Justice Department’s civil-rights division has investigated mistreatment of youths behind bars in the U.S. in recent years, finding repeated incidents of sexual abuse by staff and a lack of oversight by administrators. Facilities in Louisiana and Mississippi have agreed to make changes following federal probes. It is a crime in all 50 states for correctional staff to engage in sexual intercourse with inmates, according to a survey of state laws by the prison rape project. Additional laws prohibit sexual contact with minors.

The power imbalance between guards and young inmates creates a setting where youth are easily coerced into sex with promises of special treatment or threats of discipline, said former inmates and federal investigators.

Since the criminal case at Nampa, the teen’s conservator filed a lawsuit against the Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections. Eight other young men and one young woman also have alleged in legal claims they were sexually abused by Nampa staff members from 2008 to 2012. They have filed anonymous claims with the state, a precursor to filing suits.

Nampa police have opened a criminal investigation. A spokesman for the juvenile corrections department declined to comment on allegations about the facility, which houses as many as 84 young people ages 13 to 20. The state is fighting the suit.

Staff at Nampa allegedly groomed inmates in the manner of child molesters, according to the legal claims.

One former inmate said in an interview that a nurse gave him perks, such as soda and candy, and flirted with him. That led to sex on several occasions in the medical clinic, he said. She gave him money, then threatened to turn him in for having contraband—the money—if he refused her advances, he said. He was 18 at the time and the nurse, who is accused of having sex with other juveniles at Nampa, was in her mid-30s.

“You’re an easy target,” said the college student, now 24, who didn’t want to be named. “You have to think, ‘Why wouldn’t they do this with some young guy in the street?’ ”

The former nurse, who is named in legal claims and no longer works for the center, couldn’t be reached for comment. Jeff Ray, a spokesman for the Idaho Department of Correction and Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections, said, “We knew nothing of the allegations” at the time she left the job.

Perpetrators in these cases are often women. About 90% of youth who said they were victimized by staff in the federal survey were males reporting sexual activity with female staff.

Mary Livers, head of Louisiana’s juvenile justice system and president-elect of the American Correctional Association, said juvenile justice systems take a more therapeutic approach, with staff encouraged to build relationships. That leads to a “lot more interaction, and because of that, I think lines can get blurred,” she said. Another factor is the preponderance of male inmates living in centers with female staff who are in some cases not that much older, she said.

Dr. Livers said that the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice has changed its hiring practices to address the issue, raising salaries, screening hires more carefully and seeking out applicants with college degrees.

Federal lawmakers have sought to combat prison rape with a 2003 law just now being implemented that sets standards for preventing, reporting and investigating sexual abuse behind bars.

Six states, including Idaho, opted out of the law, citing onerous costs, among other issues. Mr. Ray said the state’s juvenile facilities are “making every effort” to comply with the federal law, while the state sets its own standards for its adult prisons.

Leadership at the Nampa facility has been accused in legal filings by attorneys for the 10 youths of not doing enough to stop alleged abuse by staff. A group of former employees has filed a federal whistleblower suit that makes similar allegations. Mr. Ray declined to comment. Idaho is fighting the suits.

In a column for the local newspaper, juvenile corrections department Director Sharon Harrigfeld wrote, “Management and staff in Nampa and throughout our system are working every day to ensure what allegedly happened before will never happen again.”

Victims slipped notes under the door of Betty Grimm, superintendent of the facility, pleading for help, one legal claim alleges. Ms. Harrigfeld and Ms. Grimm also received warnings about Ms. McCormick’s inappropriate relationship with the 15-year-old before it became sexual, according to the lawsuit.

“What are we going to do with Julie???????” Ms. Harrigfeld responded in an email to Ms. Grimm, who had written that Ms. McCormick “once again defied my direction and spent time with” the teen, court documents said. The exchange came in late June 2012, before the first sexual encounter. Ms. McCormick was fired in August after staff discovered her with the teen in her office.

Ms. Grimm, who has since retired, didn’t return calls. Mr. Ray said Ms. Harrigfeld wouldn’t comment.

The mother of the first teen to come forward said that since getting out of Nampa, her son has struggled with relationships and drugs. The teen, who just turned 18 and is working as a bus boy, didn’t want to be interviewed or named.

“He was so young,” she said. “He didn’t know he was a victim.”

Obama Pivots to Lawmakers,"President Barack Obama with House Speaker John Boehner, left, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at a bipartisan White House luncheon in November. Reuters

HONOLULU—The White House plans to pivot from President Barack Obama’s reliance on executive actions in the coming year and invest more in a legislative strategy aimed at trying to advance key policy goals with the new, Republican-controlled Congress, senior administration officials said.

The new approach reflects a White House acknowledgment that Mr. Obama has already taken some of the most significant executive actions in his arsenal as well as the idea that several of his top priorities might actually be more easily achieved without Democrats in control of the Senate, senior administration officials said.

The question is whether the two sides can get past rancor of the past several years by agreeing to disagree on certain issues where their philosophies’ diverge, and engaging on issues where there is room for compromise.

Republican leaders, aides say, want to work with Mr. Obama but are skeptical that he will compromise and that even if he does, that he will deliver the votes needed from his party.

“If he’s going to run around the country talking about things that have no chance of passing rather than running around the country focusing on the areas where we agree, he’s not going to be very productive,” said Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff to incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). “We just had an election on his policies.”

Messrs. Obama and McConnell discussed trade, taxes and infrastructure as areas of compromise during a one-on-one meeting after the November elections.

Mr. Obama’s aim is to draw only a few red lines on issues where he feels strongly, such as efforts to roll back his immigration policies, climate-change initiatives and key provisions of the health-care law, to leave maximum room for negotiating.

And there are some issues, such as energy, where Republicans are expected to put Mr. Obama on the spot right away. They plan to quickly send Mr. Obama legislation approving construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Mr. Obama has laid the groundwork in recent weeks for rejecting the pipeline, senior administration officials said, by arguing that it is environmentally and economically unsound.

Such a move could antagonize Republicans, who plan to make energy issues a key focus.

“I think that would be a mistake,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio).

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the president has been clear that there will be some actions by Congress that he won’t support, “just like some in Congress will oppose steps that we take on our own.”

“But those disagreements should not interfere with the many areas of bipartisan interest where we can work together to get things done for the American people,” Mr. Schultz said.

With Republicans taking control of the Senate and having expanded their majority in the House, Mr. Obama faces an entirely new, and unfamiliar, playing field. As a result, his aides have been devising a strategy likely to include more presidential engagement with lawmakers, senior administration officials said.

White House officials said Mr. Obama will still take some executive actions over the next year, particularly on issues like climate change, where he and Republicans on Capitol Hill remain at odds. But his primary emphasis will be on a narrow set of policies where he might find agreement with Republicans, namely trade pacts, an overhaul of the corporate tax code and funding infrastructure projects.

The White House’s legislative strategy will quickly be put to the test after the new Congress convenes next Tuesday. Mr. Obama, who is on vacation in Hawaii until Sunday, is expected to meet with congressional leaders the week they return to Washington.

The new Congress is expected to be much more contentious for Mr. Obama. GOP leaders plan to push back on Mr. Obama’s executive action on immigration policy. Senate Republicans will hold confirmation hearings for two major Cabinet posts—Defense Secretary and Attorney General—that will spotlight administration policies such as the president’s strategy on fighting Islamic State militants.

Senate Republicans are also planning a host of investigations on administration policies and agencies they oppose, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank law, Veterans Affairs and the Internal Revenue Service.

Amid those challenges, it will be especially important to Mr. Obama to get lawmakers from his own Democratic Party on board. Tax legislation will likely require Mr. Obama to accept some Republican proposals that Democrats oppose, and the White House will need to build a coalition of Republicans and Democrats to pass trade legislation, which some of the more liberal members oppose.

“We’re in favor of it. The question is: Is he going to be able to move his own party?” said Mr. Stewart.

Trade and tax proposals have broad support from business leaders who hope Mr. Obama makes a strong push to gain Democratic support. David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said he is optimistic the new Congress will pass trade legislation in particular.

“How much of that is a bipartisan solution and how much of that is an exercise in partisan vote-wrangling is going to come down to what kind of investment the president wants to make in leading on this issue,” Mr. French said.

While the White House in general anticipates Mr. Obama will use his veto power far more frequently over the next year than he has in the first six years of his presidency, what’s left unclear is how Mr. Obama will handle legislation that is expected to reach his desk with support from Democrats and Republicans, but about which he is ambivalent, such as tweaks to the Affordable Care Act. Senior administration officials said the president will contend with those so-called gray-area policies on a case-by-case basis. He is likely to accept some of them, while using others as negotiation leverage for making advances on his own policy goals.

That type of legislative horse trading hasn’t been a signature plank of Mr. Obama’s governing strategy to date, in part because he’s either had an entirely Democratic Congress, was at odds with Republicans over fiscal issues or has been employing a legislative strategy tailored to helping Democrats in tough elections. White House officials say Mr. Obama will travel the country more frequently to promote his agenda, but his tone will be less partisan and critical of Republicans than it has been in the recent past.

A cornerstone of Mr. Obama’s message in 2015 will be to tout economic progress on his watch. Mr. Obama is scheduled to deliver the annual State of the Union address on Jan. 20, where aides say he will make a forceful case for an economic agenda.

“In the coming year, we will not by shy about lifting up the significant economic gains we have made in recent years,” Mr. Schultz said.

Another early indicator will be the president’s fiscal 2016 budget request, which is due in February. The budget request reflects the White House’s priorities and often sets the tone for the year. Last year, Mr. Obama abandoned any overtures toward working with Congress and instead put forth a budget document that Republicans declared dead on arrival.

Learn to Embrace the Digital Detox,"Illustration by Pierluigi Longo

I’M IN A SMALL ROOM, surrounded by total strangers, shaking my body. It’s not a nightmare but my eyes are definitely closed. My knees are also slightly bent as I move my arms and upper body to the rhythm of the instrumental New Age music.

I used to think meditation was all about staying still—until today. Joining in everything from gentle swaying to meditative walking, I find the five-hour introductory course at London Meditation (£95; london-meditation.co.uk ) both bizarre and entertaining. But with my phone locked away, I actually manage to let go at times, forgetting about the world outside and the incessant urge to check email, Twitter and Instagram.

“With body shaking [meditation], we let go of tension and discomfort in our bodies,” says Susann Herrmann, our teacher and the founder of London Meditation. “Let the body decide what it needs.”

As I let my body shake and shake and shake for over 10 minutes, I start to question my decision to attend. How will I survive five hours? “The mind makes comments like ‘this is not meditation,’ ” says Ms. Herrmann, who was a banker in her native Germany before eventually starting London Meditation with Albert Tobler in 2005. “Shake your thoughts out, drop back to the body and feel.” I’m trying.

New years are new chances to try the things you never thought you would and the things you always said you would. Increasingly, those include ways to incorporate a little more peace and quiet into our busy lives. But if shaking it off a la Taylor Swift isn’t quite your thing, you can still find ways to step back from this digital world without ever missing a beat.

After attending a retreat in the Sahara last year, Lucy Pearson and Vikki Bates came up with the idea for Unplugged Weekend (£250; unpluggedweekend.com ). At their three-day retreats in the British countryside, participants trade smartphones for smarter life choices: exercise, art and face-to-face conversation, as well as tips and tricks on regaining balance. Life hacks include weaning yourself off social media by logging off sites on multiple platforms and turning off notifications to minimize distractions.

“People don’t think they are addicted to technology because it’s so ingrained in our everyday life,” says Ms. Bates, who sets specific times for checking email. In California, Camp Grounded ( campgrounded.org ) offers similar experiences.

Niall Campbell, an addiction consultant at London treatment center Priory Hospital, says those concerned about the amount of time they’re spending on technology should ask themselves a key question: How are the things you’re doing impacting your life?

At California’s Camp Grounded, which describes itself as summer camp for adults, no technology is allowed. Blazenhoff Industries

“People don’t often recognize the effect their behavior has on them and those around them,” says Mr. Campbell. He concedes that identifying an addiction to technology is difficult, but adds that “as the access to technology becomes easier, it will become more apparent.” At Priory, Internet addiction treatment for those with significant issues includes an individual rehabilitation program that costs around £1,500 for 10 to 15 sessions.

The Guide // Curb Your Enthusiasm How many times have you checked your phone today? Chances are it’s more than you’d expect (after all, you do live in the 21st century). Here, three easy ways to monitor—and decrease—your usage. Phone Addict: This easy-to-use Android app monitors the time you spend on a portable device (tablet or phone). It tracks historical use as well as maximum use on a particular day—showing you just how glued to your phone you are. For added accountability, there’s also a tool that allows you to share the extent of your addiction with others on social media—though it doesn’t yet allow for comparisons with other users. Free; play.google.com Moment: This iOS app allows you to monitors how many times you pick up your iPhone or iPad each day and provides a breakdown of when you’re on your device. You can set a daily usage limit—anything from 5 minutes to 6 hours—and the app will send you a message alerting you if you’ve gone past it. These can get annoying if you’ve exceeded your limit substantially—which, I suppose, means it’s doing its job. There is a drawback, however. The app needs to track the places you go to track your phone use, which means considerable battery consumption. £2.99; itunes.apple.com Nophone: This isn’t an app but an actual phone—or rather, a nophone. Meant to work as a substitute for any mobile device, it has the shape and look of a smartphone. But in reality, it’s just a piece of plastic for you to hold. Addiction proof, it will save you from having to constantly look for a power socket. $12; nophone.myshopify.com

If checking yourself into a clinic seems too drastic, a trip to a monastery might be your ticket to unplugging this year. In Wales, Caldey Abbey’s St. Philomena guesthouse ( caldey-island.co.uk ) offers a respite from the vicissitudes of the modern world. Open from Easter until October, the retreat center on Caldey Island keeps in line with Cistercian practices: visitors are asked to work, helping clean up and making their beds, and payment is by donation.

At Assisi Retreats in Italy, you can sign up for six-day guided or self-guided retreats at the four-star country villa. The program includes morning and evening meditation, with time in the day to head into town, where reminders of that great contemplative, St. Francis, abound. The four guest rooms are available on a first-come, first-serve basis, and meals aren’t included. (From €635 for guided retreat with accommodation; assisiretreats.org )

But you don’t have to travel miles to reassess your relationship with technology. Some of the most effective ways to digitally detox are, not surprisingly, the simplest: Buy an old-fashioned alarm clock, take a bath, switch to paper (remember those things we call books?), play a game.

After attending Unplugged Weekend last summer, Berni Britton says she’s cut back on the time she spends on her phone. “I don’t text people straight back,” she says, “and we play board games or talk more in the house.”

Back at London Meditation, I haven’t heard the ding of a text arriving in hours. But I’m feeling less anxious about the lack of constant updates. I find the silent break, where we eat snacks and drink tea on our own, utterly refreshing and my fears of five hours becoming an eternity have faded. In fact, I’m surprised at how quickly time passes as we’re guided through this taster course on meditation. As we get ready to leave, Ms. Herrmann sends us off with some advice: “You shouldn’t do body shaking in public.” No worries there. The second I’m out the door, I check my phone. No messages.

Addicted to Technology? Four Classic Types of Over-Users

Illustration by Pierluigi Longo

THE OVERSHARER

Diagnosis: My dog just barked! My cat just meowed. :) ;) <3 The oversharer seems to have no internal filter, posting anything and everything that crosses their mind almost instantly. They are also very fond of sharing the results of the latest online quiz they’ve taken, from “What country should you live in?” to “What ‘Frozen’ character are you?”

Remedy: Out of all the online addicts, these need the most help. Remove smartphone and other devices—prying them from their hands if necessary—until they seek medical attention.

THE LIKER

Diagnosis:Liking everything on Facebook and Instagram, or favoriting tweet after tweet can become an addiction. It’s just so good and so easy! From a link about the latest burger joint to open to random posts from childhood friends they haven’t seen since 1981, the liker will like it every time.

Remedy: Every time you hit that Like button, put aside a dollar. At the end of the week, give all the money to the person you like the least.

Illustration by Pierluigi Longo

THE REFRESHER

Diagnosis: In a constant state of expectation, the refresher can’t help checking their work inbox incessantly. At home, it’s no better; phone in hand wherever they are, they tap Mail, Twitter, Instagram and news feeds in an endless cycle. Online, they refresh and refresh pages as if some big news or something out of this world is about to happen. The sad reality is it rarely does.

Remedy: Stop, in the name of love, before you break your phone. Think it o-o-over.

THE COMMENTATOR

Diagnosis: Can’t see a Facebook post without adding a comment? Feel the need to be the first to made a witty statement about that cute cat dressed like a giraffe? Just HAVE to share the best video in the whole entire world? Then we’re talking to you. Sadly, you’re too busy commenting to notice.

Remedy: Next time you feel like you have to comment on a post, pinch yourself (hard).

Affordable Care Act Creates a Trickier Tax Season,"This year, all taxpayers have to report to the IRS for the first time whether or not they had health insurance the previous year. Associated Press

The first year of the Affordable Care Act is in the books, and now comes a tricky tax-filing season for millions of Americans.

The law’s requirement that most Americans carry health insurance means all filers must indicate on federal tax forms whether they had coverage last year and got tax credits to help pay for it. Those who didn’t have coverage could face a fine, although reduced staffing at the Internal Revenue Service and certain changes to the law mean the so-called individual mandate is expected to be lightly enforced this year, tax preparers say.

Meanwhile, millions of Americans who got subsidies under the law may find they are getting smaller-than-expected refunds or owe the IRS because credits they received to offset their insurance premiums were too large. As many as half of the roughly 6.8 million Americans who got subsidies may have to refund money to the government, based on one estimate by tax firm H&R Block Inc.

“The ACA is going to result in more confusion for existing clients and many taxpayers may well be very disappointed by getting less money and possibly even owing money,” said Charles McCabe, president of Peoples Income Tax and the Income Tax School, a Richmond, Va., provider of tax preparation and education. “The whole implementation of Obamacare will be frustrating for tax preparers.”

What if you didn’t have health insurance in 2014?

But the season could be a lucrative one for tax firms. Liberty Tax Service, a tax-preparation franchise, began calling hundreds of thousands of customers in November to invite them to a store to get help applying for an exemption to the insurance-coverage requirement. About half of the company’s 4,000 stores opened weeks ahead of their usual start date to provide health-law tax advice.

The IRS also is expecting more calls from consumers at a time when congressional funding for the agency has dropped nearly $1 billion since fiscal 2010, and its workforce has 13,000 fewer full-time employees than it did in 2010. Congressional Republicans opposed to the health law have said limiting the IRS’s budget is one way to slow the law’s implementation, including in last month’s budget agreement for the remainder of fiscal 2015.

IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, in a November speech, said his agency’s reduced funding would hamper its ability “to provide the level of taxpayer services that the public has a right to expect.”

To help avert problems, federal agencies including the IRS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in January will reach out to consumers via phone calls, text messages and emails to tell them what to expect during the tax season. IRS officials are urging consumers to file electronically for a quicker return.

The original 2010 health law had more mechanisms to enforce the insurance-coverage requirement. It required employers to supply the agency with the names of about 150 million Americans who got coverage through their job.

But the Obama administration in 2013 delayed that reporting requirement. It also widened the list of reasons a person could avoid paying the penalty if he skipped insurance coverage, exempting certain people whose insurance plans were canceled because of the law.

This year, the IRS said it is entrusting consumers to answer honestly if they had health insurance or need to pay a penalty. While the agency said it won’t reject returns if questions about health coverage aren’t answered, it said consumers who don’t answer affirmatively that they had coverage will be expected to have an exemption or request one, or to calculate the penalty they owe. The fine for not having coverage starts at $95 and ranges up to 1% of household income, which would be added to 2014 tax liability.

Some makers of tax-filing software, including Intuit Inc.’s TurboTax, say they have set up their systems to reject incomplete forms. But tax preparers say there is little to stop a filer from asserting they have coverage, thereby avoiding any penalty, even if they were uninsured. IRS officials note the tax system for years has been built on voluntary compliance, and the agency said it could use its regular enforcement tools, such as asking for more documentation or auditing.

“As always, taxpayers are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the tax returns that they sign,” said Anthony Burke, an IRS spokesman. He added that “the vast majority of filers will have had coverage for the full year and will simply need to check a box to indicate that.”

The IRS also said it would allow taxpayers who have applied for—but not yet received—exemptions from the individual mandate to put “pending” on their forms so they don’t have to delay filing and obtaining their refund.

In addition to determining who has to pay a penalty, the accuracy of tax credits is likely to pose challenges. Because people often incorrectly estimate their future income, many Americans may have gotten subsidies—based on their own projections of 2014 income—that were too generous.

Tax credits for people eligible to use the health law’s exchanges would, on average, be too high by $208 if they were based on the applicants’ most recent tax returns, according to modeling by Vanderbilt University assistant professor John Graves. The IRS said some filers got subsidies that were too small and will get larger refunds.

When the health law was passed, the amount of money that could be taken back from lower-income people who overestimated their incomes was capped at $250 for a single person and $400 for a household. Those caps were significantly raised in an effort to fund Medicare physician payments in late 2010, to as much as $2,500 for a family at the upper end of the income-eligibility range. They were tweaked again in 2011 as part of a tax change to the health law’s 1099 reporting forms that required more people to reimburse overpayments in full.

Washington’s To-Do List for 2015,"House Speaker John Boehner, left, stands with newly elected members of the House GOP leadership team in November. Getty Images

WASHINGTON—While President Barack Obama and Republican leaders in Congress disagree on a lot of things, they have a few overlapping ambitions for 2015, including the business tax code and securing trade deals. But emboldened right and left wings and looming 2016 elections could overwhelm any effort toward bipartisan deals.

Entering what he calls the “fourth quarter” of his presidency, Mr. Obama has called for overhauling the business tax code to lower rates but eliminate many deductions. He also wants to resume “fast-track” approval for trade deals.

The president has a number of other priorities, such as raising the minimum wage and overhauling immigration rules, but neither has much chance in a GOP-controlled Congress. Similarly, Republicans are expected to push for large changes to Medicare and a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. Obama has said he would block.

But even a targeted focus on trade and business-tax changes could lead to disappointment in 2015.

The midterm elections had the effect of emboldening the ideological wings of both parties. Conservatives read the results, which gave Republicans control of the Senate and an expanded House majority, as a mandate for their policies. Some Democrats felt they lost because they weren’t liberal enough, and they have urged the party to take a harder line against political compromise, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as their guide.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), meanwhile, displayed during Congress’s lame-duck session that he plans to continue bucking GOP leaders, a dynamic that could complicate efforts by House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to advance a unified Republican agenda. Mr. Cruz has said, for example, that Republicans should take a tougher stance against the health-care law and Mr. Obama’s recent executive order to change immigration rules.

To be sure, there are a number of deadlines that Mr. Obama and Congress will have to face together. Government funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires in February, something only Congress can reauthorize. Funding for the highway trust fund, which pays for roads and other projects, expires in May. The Export-Import Bank’s authorization expires at the end of June, which means the agency would need new approval from Congress to finance more projects after that date.

And perhaps most important, Congress will have to decide sometime in the first half of the year how to deal with the debt ceiling, as the government could run out of the ability to borrow to pay all of its bills by the summer. Incoming House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R., Ga.) has said the GOP should use the debt ceiling as a “pinch point,” pushing for big changes in tax or spending rules. But the White House has said it wouldn’t negotiate budget changes in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.

On taxes, Republican leaders have nearly identical goals, though they want corporate-tax rates to be 25% or less, lower than Mr. Obama’s proposed 28%. Both sides have much different approaches for how to tax multinational companies’ overseas earnings.

On trade, Mr. Obama and Republican leaders both back the resumption of a fast-track approval process that expired in 2007, which would allow the White House to secure up-or-down votes on trade deals with Congress, insulating these agreements from legislative changes. Many liberals oppose this process, saying it could hurt domestic labor unions, but many Republicans believe these agreements would help expand trade.

Mr. McConnell noted both taxes and trade the day after the election that made him the majority leader come January. “There are a lot of people who believe that just because you have divided government doesn’t mean you don’t accomplish anything,” he said.

There could be other areas of joint focus, such as differing proposals from Mr. Obama and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) to expand the Earned-Income Tax Credit, but both parties have said there is a relatively small window of time for any negotiating, given the fast-approaching presidential campaign.

In fact, the long shadow of 2016 could be the most dominant political force in 2015. Two people—Democrat Jim Webb and Republican Jeb Bush —have already said they are exploring a run for the White House, and numerous others are expected to make decisions before Memorial Day. Presidential politics, both for Democrats and Republicans, could force the parties to change their agendas, focusing more on policies with populist punch.

These Streakers Resolve to Run Every Day of the Year,"A charter member of the U.S. Running Streak Association, Robert ‘Raven’ Kraft, a Miami songwriter, has run every day since Jan. 1, 1975. Mary Beth Koeth

Robert Kraft isn’t certain he will fulfill his New Year’s resolution to run every day of 2015. At 64 years old, the Miami songwriter suffers from arthritis, spinal stenosis and a degenerated disk.

But there are 40 reasons to think he might succeed. Each Dec. 31 since 1974, Mr. Kraft has resolved to try running every day of the New Year, and he has yet to fail. After completing his run Wednesday, Mr. Kraft will have logged 40 consecutive years of daily running. That translates to 14,610 consecutive days of running, typically 8 miles per session. “It was the New Year’s resolution that kept on giving,” says Mr. Kraft, a Miami Beach icon known as “Raven” for his black running apparel.

Mr. Kraft is a charter member of the U.S. Running Streak Association, a club whose members traipse blithely upon a golden rule of sports medicine: Runners need rest days. The USRSA’s own home page contains the essay “Caution: The Dangers of Streak Running.” Benjamin D. Levine, a cardiology and exercise-science professor at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas, says in an email: “A person who goes out and runs despite having chest pain, palpitations and syncope (fainting) is asking for trouble! So too someone with a severe cold, or other systemic illness.”

Mark Washburne

If streak running is a hazard, then New Year’s is its high season. “Jan. 1 is our biggest day of the year for people starting streaks, and the No. 2 day is Dec. 31,” says USRSA president Mark Washburne, whose own streak started Dec. 31, 1989. His run Tuesday marked 25 years of running every day.

The New Year’s surge at USRSA doesn’t resemble a January gym mob. That is because the USRSA imposes an initiation fee that is steep in sweat: To join the list of active streakers, a person must have run at least a mile a day for 365 consecutive days. Last Jan. 1—the biggest new-member day of 2014—the association welcomed exactly six newcomers. “It’s not easy,” says Lesley Murphy, a 62-year-old Pennsylvania woman whose own streak ended in November when she forgot to run one day.

The USRSA has no idea how many people launch New Year’s streaks that fizzle out short of the 365-day requirement. But success is rare. The association’s active-streaker list numbers only about 494.

Yet a streaking movement is afoot. Three years ago, that list contained only 269 names. During the same period, the number of runners who joined the association’s Facebook page jumped from fewer than 40 to 1,870, the vast majority of them still striving for 365 days. “Already addicted to streaking!” said a post this Monday from a 33-day streaker.

Streaking lore is rich with tales of those who kept their streaks alive by running sick, within hours of undergoing surgery, the morning after giving birth. These stories inspire fellow streakers and raise the eyebrows of many physicians. “Some of these folks have obsessive compulsive disorders [that] interfere with their ability to back off,” says Paul Thompson, a sports cardiologist who says that diagnosis is based on anecdotal rather than scientific evidence.

It might also be tinged by envy. A lifelong marathoner—he qualified for the 1972 U.S. Olympic trials—Dr. Thompson never put together even three weeks of daily running. “I’m an admirer of streak running [but] it just frustrated me,” he wrote in an email. “I think my max was 18 or so” days. By contrast, the world champion streaker, England’s Ron Hill, reached 50 years of consecutive daily running on Dec. 20, and the leading American, California’s Jon Sutherland, has run every day for more than 45 years.

On occasion, the USRSA has examined running logs to verify streaks that date back long before 2000, when some longtime streakers decided to start the organization. But it mostly operates on the honor system. When Ms. Murphy realized in November that she had forgotten to run the day before, she briefly considered running twice another day to make up for it—and telling no one. Then she came clean on the USRSA Facebook page. “I would have known the truth, and that’s all that matters,” says Ms. Murphy, a late-life convert—she started running at 57—who plans to start a new streak after the New Year.

As USRSA president, Mr. Washburne has researched the causes of broken streaks. The most common is injury, he says, followed by voluntarily deciding to stop, sometimes because of goal attainment. “The most common end point for streaks is one year, or one year and a day,” he said.

Another streak killer is forgetfulness. After starting a streak on New Year’s Day 2010, Margo Barber put together 1,268 daily runs. On what she thought was her 1,270th day, she was running when a terrible thought occurred to her. “I can’t believe I forgot to run yesterday,” Ms. Barber, a Michigan teacher, recalls screaming. Her new streak now exceeds 550 days.

Some streakers believe that longevity obsessions can become unhealthy. After reaching 131 days last summer, Michelle Fritz felt as though her streak was taking precedence over her husband and children. “The streak turned into an idol,” says Ms. Fritz, the wife of a minister in Manilla, Iowa.

So she stopped. “I really felt better after ending it,” says Ms. Fritz, whose new streak is approaching 100 days.

To judge from the association’s Facebook page, growing numbers of runners are ditching the quest for streaking perfection. “I think doing a full year would send me mad,” says Mark Baldwin, a British videogames specialist who favors shorter streaks, having found that long ones can take the joy out of running. “I don’t want to be a slave to the run,” he says.

Others develop tricks for minimizing the physical and psychic toll of streak running. In December, Coloradan Thomas Comer fulfilled two days’ streaking obligations in a single outing—by running on both sides of midnight. “3.21 mi for day 509 before midnight and 2.11 mi after midnight for day 510,” Mr. Comer posted on the association’s Facebook page. “Sometimes you gotta be creative.”

In streaking circles, that is known as the crossover, and for busy professionals it can be streak-saving. Still, after Erin Smith, a speech pathologist near Albany, N.Y., did a crossover this year, she wrote, “I feel like I’m cheating a little.”

Overseas Headwinds Test U.S. Economy,"The Wall Street Journal

The U.S. economy enters 2015 with the strongest momentum in at least a decade and as the fittest of all the industrialized nations. The question is whether that muscle can help yank the rest of the world out of its doldrums.

“Our expectation is for a fairly robust U.S. economy, and that’s where the good news starts and ends,” said Adolfo Laurenti, chief international economist for investment and advisory firm Mesirow Financial. “Everything else in the world looks choppy.”

The nation added 2.7 million jobs in 2014 through November, the best year for employment growth since 1999. Economic output registered its best six-month stretch since 2003. Claims for jobless benefits have been running lower than at any point since 2000.

But after six slow years of economic recovery, the test for the U.S. is no longer just about overcoming employer reluctance to hire and lingering damage from the housing bubble. It is whether the U.S. can thrive when so much of the world is stumbling.

Plunging oil prices, while good for consumers and their spending power, are expected to slow economic growth in petroleum-producing regions ranging from Russia to Africa to Latin America. Geopolitical worries from the Middle East to Eastern Europe hang over swaths of the globe. The eurozone remains lethargic with some of its members, like Italy, tumbling into a third recession since the financial crisis.

China’s economy, long seen as a global growth engine, has been hit by slumping real estate, weak domestic demand and tumbling industrial production. In the third quarter, China grew 7.3% from a year earlier, but that was its slowest rate in five years. Japan has notched two quarters of contraction, heralding another recession.

Many of the world’s politicians and central bankers are struggling to jump-start the global economy, either because of the challenges of debt overhangs and aging demographics in advanced economies or because of an unwillingness to deploy some of their own powers in unpopular ways.

In this world of rising risks, many companies seek out the U.S. as a safe harbor. “The geopolitical developments matter much more than many people believe,” Joe Kaeser, chief executive of Siemens AG of Germany, said in a presentation last month. “That’s why we invest in the United States, as certainly the most attractive, most safe geopolitical region.”

To be sure, the U.S. has weathered global weakness before. International turmoil has a history of denting U.S. growth but not toppling it.

The Asian and Russian financial crises of the late 1990s caused a scare, and even led to the implosion of a major U.S. hedge fund. But “even though there was a big slowdown in global industrial production, it had essentially zero effect on the U.S. economy,” said Wells Fargo global economist Jay Bryson. “In the modern era, I cannot think of a cycle here that was caused by a slowdown abroad.”

The rest of the world, too, has become less dependent on the U.S., blunting the positive impact of a healthier U.S. economy. As recently as 2002, the U.S. accounted for 32% of world GDP, according to the World Bank. That share declined over the next decade and has sat around 22% since 2011. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest importer, but it accounts for just 13% of global imports, down from 16% in 2005.

The world is more globalized than ever before, and the linkages among financial markets have increased. But the U.S. is less reliant on trade than any other economy. According to the World Bank, exports made up 14% of U.S. GDP in 2012, the most recent year for which full international figures are available. That compared with 27% for China, 32% for the U.K., and 45% for the eurozone.

Recent recessions underscore the point that the U.S. economy often acts on its own. The recession that began in 2007 followed the crumbling of U.S. home prices and was exacerbated by the collapse of U.S. financial institutions. The 2001 recession came amid a bursting tech-stock bubble. Recessions in the early 1980s and ’90s came after monetary tightening campaigns by the Federal Reserve. Soaring oil prices choked the economy in the 1970s.

The combination of domestic strength, global weakness and plunging oil prices could present a challenging landscape for global central banks.

Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen has laid the groundwork for the central bank to raise interest rates around midyear, bringing to an end a nearly seven-year era of short-term interest rates near zero. But she will need the economy to cooperate in order to unite the Federal Open Market Committee around a campaign to tighten monetary policy.

The U.S. has now recovered all the jobs lost during the recession and enters 2015 with record employment, and if recent trends continue, the labor market this year will reach the Fed’s estimates for what is considered full employment. Yet not all is well. The labor-force participation rate is near the lowest since the 1970s, wage growth has remained weak, and an elevated number of part-time workers want, but can’t find, full-time work. Those who become unemployed remain that way for an unusually long time.

Meanwhile, measures of inflation are likely to drift even further from the Fed’s goals. The central bank believes inflation below 2% makes it harder for people to pay off debts, and more difficult for monetary policy to goose the economy.

“Markets are strongly hinting that global deflationary trends are so strong the Fed will have trouble hitting 2% for quite some time,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist for Barclays and a former Fed economist.

The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan may see their goals of juicing economic growth complicated by falling inflation. Already, aging populations and enormous debt burdens—problems that can’t be swiftly addressed—weigh on economic growth. Japan and Europe appear set to move toward further monetary easing in 2015 even as the Fed begins tightening. Those divergent policy paths could pose a new family of challenges.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 18000 for the first time in late December. If the bull market continues to March, it will be six years old. But the tide of buoyant markets has a history of turning when least expected, and a tightening of U.S. monetary policy could create a challenging environment for equities.

Broken Deals Rein In a Strong M&A Market,"Pfizer’s roughly $120 billion bid for British drug company AstraZeneca was among the potential takeovers that were scrapped in 2014.

One of the best years ever for mergers and acquisitions could have been even better.

After years of sluggish activity, the M&A market shifted into high gear in 2014. There were $3.4 trillion of deals struck globally, up about 30% from the prior year, according to Dealogic. That’s the largest total since 2007.

It was also a banner year for attempted deals that foundered, as a government crackdown on a popular tax-driven merger strategy and other factors weighed on the market. The value of takeover proposals that were rejected or withdrawn totaled more than $570 billion in 2014, more than double the prior year’s total and the second-highest tally on record after 2008.

The two largest attempted deals of the year— Pfizer Inc.’s roughly $120 billion bid for British drug company AstraZeneca PLC and 21st Century Fox Inc.’s effort to buy Time Warner Inc. for $80 billion—were consigned to the M&A scrap heap after the bids were rejected and the suitors walked away.

AbbVie Inc., meanwhile, pulled the plug on its agreement to buy Dublin-based drug maker Shire PLC for $54 billion after the U.S. government announced a set of rules aimed at making the deal and other so-called tax inversions unattractive for companies attempting them.

If those and other abortive takeover efforts had come to fruition, it would have pushed last year’s deal value to about $4 trillion, making 2014 the second-best year on record for M&A, outpacing the $3.7 trillion of deals signed in 2006. The 2014 tally is still the third-highest on record.

While a number of ingredients for global deal making fell into place in 2014, there were formidable obstacles too.

Inversion deals became popular in 2014. They involve a U.S. business buying a company in a lower-tax country so it can switch its legal home and cut its tax bills. The strategy particularly appealed to pharmaceutical companies, whose overseas sales generate significant income that can’t be brought back to the U.S. without the company taking a tax hit.

In September, however, the U.S. Treasury issued rules that make such deals less attractive financially. AbbVie cited those rules in abandoning its deal with Shire. AstraZeneca officials pointed to the potential for political resistance as one its reasons for turning away Pfizer’s repeated takeover approaches before the U.S. drug giant gave up on the effort.

The eurozone, meanwhile, registered annualized growth of just 0.6% in the third quarter of 2014 as it continued to grapple with the aftereffects of the financial crisis. Gross domestic product in the region remained more than 2% below where it was when the global financial crisis hit in 2008.

When companies are uncertain about the future of the economies in which they operate, buyers and sellers have a harder time agreeing on price and other terms, bankers say.

“Where there’s uncertainty, the buyers rightly have a cautious view of the future, whereas sellers still have rosy prospects,” said Matthew Ponsonby, head of M&A in the European region at Barclays PLC.

That helps explain why Europe, the Middle East and Africa, known as EMEA, accounted for more than half the value of abandoned deals in 2014, according to Dealogic. EMEA deal volume lagged the global pace, growing 15% to $972 billion.

There were more than $300 billion of withdrawn or rejected mergers in the region last year, more than triple last year’s tally and the highest total since 2008. Both the AstraZenenca and Shire deals would have been considered European because the target company was located in Europe.

Some bankers see a silver lining in all the failed deal attempts. The fact that companies are contemplating such moves is a sign that chief executives and boards once again have an appetite for large-scale M&A, they say.

There’s “a healthy level of strategic dialogue taking place in many important industries,” said François-Xavier de Mallmann, the global co-head of consumer, retail and health-care investment banking at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in London.

Potential deals that stumbled because of differences between the parties on price and other matters included SABMiller PLC’s overture to Heineken NV, which has a market capitalization of €34 billion ($41 billion). The Dutch brewer rejected the approach, saying in September that it was “nonactionable.” It didn’t elaborate.

In October, France’s Iliad SA walked away from a bid for control of T-Mobile US Inc., saying the wireless carrier’s parent, Deutsche Telekom AG , wasn’t interested in the offer.

Political issues also chilled the M&A environment. Pfizer’s approach to AstraZeneca, for example, came under heavy scrutiny from the British government, which was fearful of the impact on jobs.

There would have been an even bigger broken-deals tally if another effort hadn’t failed before it became public. U.K. mining giant Rio Tinto PLC, with a market value of £56 billion ($87 billion), rebuffed a takeover approach from Glencore PLC this summer. Rio Tinto rejected the offer because it didn’t include a premium, a person familiar with the matter has said.",REAL

Factory Floor Poised to Defy Gravity,"An Airstream factory in Jackson Center, Ohio. Associated Press

Economics may or may not be rocket science, but economists certainly sound a bit like rocket scientists sometimes.

Aside from an affinity for pages full of complicated-looking equations backing up sometimes fantastic assertions, there is this idea of “escape velocity” investors keep hearing about.

For Ph.D.s working at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, that refers to the speed at which an object breaks free of Earth’s gravity (about 25,000 miles an hour, by the way).

When economists use the term, they are talking about the pace of economic growth necessary to finally escape the pull of a recession.

Not surprisingly, there is no agreed-upon speed. That is why there have been a few false alarms since the last downturn ended in June 2009. Evidence that economists believe we haven’t quite hit the right pace is that the Federal Reserve has pegged interest rates at zero and likely will keep them there until the middle of this year.

But one of the first data points of 2015 may provide further evidence the economy is moving fast enough. The monthly report on manufacturing from the Institute for Supply Management was near a 3½-year high at about 59 for both October and November. December’s reading, due out Friday, also likely will look fairly strong.

To put that number into perspective, only eight of the 73 readings during the last economic expansion ever got that high. More significantly, all came before September 2004 and so occurred in the first few years of the expansion rather than the last few. The economy kept expanding but needed no more artificial propulsion.

This time, thrusters remained on full until quantitative easing ended in October and remain red-hot today.

The fact that ISM figures are high in the early part of expansions is natural. It is a diffusion index that asks whether a number of indicators are better, worse or the same than before. Improvement is tougher to come by after a while.

The fact the index is so high today in month 67 of the expansion (the average postwar expansion has lasted only 59 months) suggests one of two things: Either the gravitational pull of the recession was unprecedented or we should have jettisoned the economic boosters already.

Self-Checkout Begins to Take Hold in Japan,"In a country where service is king, some supermarkets are introducing automated checkout machines. Labor-saving technology could be important for Japan’s economy as the nation ages. Photo: Miho Inada/The Wall Street Journal

TOKYO—In a land where service is king, a few big retailers are committing lèse-majesté. They are replacing checkout clerks with machines.

Japan’s biggest retail group by revenue, Aeon Co. , has put nearly 3,000 automatic checkers in hundreds of stores nationwide. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s WMT 0.12% Japan subsidiary plans to more than double the number in its stores in 2015.

To economists, the trend is heartening. Investment in labor-saving devices could boost long-term growth and help corporations overcome a shortage of workers willing to do menial jobs at low pay. American retailers long ago realized this and stuffed their stores with automatic checkers—to the point that Wal-Mart’s U.S. unit has begun restoring more human checkers to deal with problems machines can’t answer.

“Japan’s economy continues to be at a critical point in terms of whether it can further improve its labor productivity,” said Takehiro Sato, a member of the Bank of Japan ’s policy board, in a recent speech.

Still, this is Japan, home of omotenashi or elaborate courtesy, where even convenience-store workers on the graveyard shift take care to wrap a plastic bag just so. “You can still see a tendency in the services sector to hold off in improving staffing efficiency, provided there’s no major deterioration in business performance,” said Minoru Fukuda, who advises retailers at strategy consultancy Roland Berger.

Retailer Aeon has installed nearly 3,000 automatic checkers in Japan, including at the above store in Chiba. Reuters

Retailers are thinking of customers like Toshiko Nakagawa, a 65-year-old homemaker, who said she lives alone and prefers to make contact with people when she shops.

“I feel at ease with human checkers,” she said while shopping at a big-box Aeon AONNY 1.30% store near Tokyo Bay, where 12 self-checkout machines from the Japan unit of NCR Corp. are installed alongside as many as 20 staffed checkouts.

Aeon says it is keeping plenty of human checkers at its stores but has found that many customers say they like the ease of sweeping their purchase past a robot eye.

“Some customers use only self-checkout,” said Satoru Yamashita, the company’s store operations improvement department manager. He observed that Japanese consumers tend to shop daily and buy smaller quantities, making it easier to handle all their purchases without help from a cashier. “I usually use self-checkout terminals three to four times a week because you don’t have to wait so much,” said Masato Shimizu, an office worker. “You can buy without having contact with people. That’s another good thing.”

The Seiyu supermarket chain, which is owned by Wal-Mart, plans to expand to 660 self-checkout machines by the end of 2015 from 260 earlier in 2014. East Japan Railway Co. said it plans to expand the number of its station convenience stores with self-checkout systems to 150 from 111 in the spring of 2015, meaning about one-third of its stores will have them.

Muji, the simple-chic retailer of home goods, clothing and furniture, plans to install its first self-checkout machines in January, according to Ryohin Keikaku Co. , the retailer that owns the brand.

The U.S., with about 93,000 self-checkout machines as of 2013, still has 10 times as many as Japan, according to London-based research and consulting firm Retail Banking Research. But growth in Japan is faster: The number grew 139% between 2009 and 2013 compared with 28% growth in the U.S. over that period.

Economists say Japan needs to get more aggressive about labor-saving investment because the workforce is aging. Although a rise in the national sales tax hit consumption in 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s pro-growth policies have tightened the labor market and lifted wages moderately. The country’s jobless rate was just 3.5% in November, a 17-year low.

Japan’s working-age population peaked long ago, in the mid-1990s. But with the economy long in the doldrums, some companies could still thrive by hiring low-cost labor and slashing prices. The pattern perpetuated deflation, or consistently falling prices.

Now the shortage of low-wage labor is making retailers rethink their strategies.

“It might have become more advantageous for some firms to invest in labor-saving machinery and equipment than to hire new employees,” said Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda in a November speech.

Japan’s service industries suffer from low productivity compared with the U.S.—a contrast with the nation’s manufacturers, which have been exposed to global competition and are often among the world’s most efficient.

Roland Berger’s Mr. Fukuda said the benefits of self-checkout machines were likely to accrue to deep-pocketed companies in big cities where the investment can bring the biggest return. Rail-station stores were an ideal spot, he said, because commuters normally buy only a few items, carry stored-value cards to pay and aren’t likely to shoplift. “In light of this, self-checkout may be an factor in accelerating winners and losers in the industry,” he said.
