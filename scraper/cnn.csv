"Chicago police tout 14% homicide drop, and concede there's more to do","(CNN) Chicago police Friday touted a 14% drop in homicides so far this year compared with an exceptionally bloody 2016, saying staffing investments and other strategies are reducing the kinds of violence that left some neighborhoods in despair.

Still, the number of killings in the nation's third-largest city in 2017 remains higher than in almost any other year of the past decade -- and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said his officers know there's more to do.

""I would say ... we're making progress ... But it's going to take time to root out everything we need to do,"" Johnson told reporters Friday outside a church on the city's southwest side.

The city's homicide total so far this year is 609, police say. That's a 14% decline from this point last year when there had been 710 homicides. The year 2016 ended with 771 homicides.

Johnson also highlighted the following police-compiled stats for the year's first 11 months as evidence the Windy City is making strides:

• 703 fewer shootings reported to police, a 21% decline from this point in 2016;

• 798 fewer shooting victims, a 20% decline.

But while the number of killings may be down this year from last, this year's 609 homicides already total well above most annual tallies in Chicago for the past decade.

""It's important to keep in mind these numbers aren't a spike of the football by any means,"" but an indication progress is being made, Johnson said.

Still, Johnson and community activists acknowledged that current crime levels still sow fear in neighborhoods.

""It's great there's a slight decrease from last year, but let's not forget that last year was the worst in 20 years,"" Father Michael Pfleger, pastor at Saint Sabina Church and an activist on Chicago's South Side, told CNN.

""Let's not use the barometer of last year. Let's look over the last three or four years. Hell, anything should look good next to last year.""

Chicago also has been a frequent target of criticism for President Donald Trump, who has talked and tweeted about rampant crime and the failure to fight gun violence there.

""It's worse than some of the places that we read about in the Middle East,"" Trump said in February.

Crime-fighting investments made

The 771 homicides in 2016 represented a considerable spike over 2015. It was the largest single-year homicide increase in 25 years among the five most populous US cities, according to the Justice Department.

The Chicago Tribune, which tracks homicides in the city, has a slightly higher count for 2017 than the police department: 624, as of Friday. The Chicago Police Department uses slightly different criteria when compiling its tally. For example, CPD does not include killings that occurred on area highways, or those where police are involved and it is determined to be a justifiable homicide.

Between 2007 and 2015, the number of yearly homicides in Chicago hovered between 400 and just about 500

Johnson said certain investments, including technology, have helped police tackle crime this year.

That includes putting ""strategic decision support centers"" in neighborhoods that have struggled with violence, he said.

Those centers use predictive crime software that helps police commanders decide where to deploy officers. They also provide ""additional cameras, gunshot detection systems, and mobile phones to officers in the field who receive real-time notifications and intelligence data at their fingertips,"" Chicago police say on their website.

The centers are staffed by officers and analysts with the University of Chicago's Crime Lab.

""Officers who used to patrol randomly are now more focused on where to be,"" said Kim Smith, a Crime Lab research manager. ""Being in the right place at the right time is crucial, especially somewhere like Chicago, where there are ever-changing gang conflicts. ... We're trying to use data to shed some light where your resources are the most effective.""

The high-tech centers are currently in place in six of the city's 22 police districts, Smith said. Those six district last year accounted for more than half of city's shootings but only 25% of the population.

""I cannot say with 100% certainly that the (support centers) are leading to all the reductions we're seeing,"" she said. ""But I do think the processes and the use of technology ... are really driving either a shift in the way the policing is done in Chicago that as a result leads to these reductions, or just getting people excited about a new initiative that seems to be working.""

The department also is in the midst of a hiring spree that will see the roster grow by 1,000 officers, Johnson said.

The task force includes an additional 20 ATF agents, as well as 12 Chicago police officers, two Illinois state troopers, six intelligence analysts and state and federal prosecutors.

Rooting out police corruption

The police department has been plagued in recent years by corruption scandals, and a Justice Department investigation in 2016 found that it unconstitutionally engaged in a pattern of excessive force and had severely insufficient training and accountability procedures.

""If we take the route of just the new technology and do not equally push the human connection, I believe we'll hit a dead end sooner or later,"" Pfleger said. ""You have to have relationship building in the community.""

Indeed, mistrust in the police has been a major factor in the city's soaring crime rate, University of Chicago law professor Craig Futterman said.

""The biggest thing that they can do now would be improving accountability, transparency and honesty and do the kinds of things necessary to build trust,"" he said, though he noted that police cannot solve every problem that contributes to crime.

""The biggest things that I've seen in my work that drive violence in Chicago are the absence of hope, opportunity, jobs and the lack of police accountability,"" Futterman added. ""Jobs, hope and opportunity are not within the control of the police department.""

'See us in a new light'

Homicides were down 44% in the city's impoverished and notoriously deadly Englewood neighborhood -- the first police district to use the new support-center technology, police said.

Greater community outreach also contributed to the decline in crime, Kenneth Johnson, the district commander, told CNN.

""We're not just standing apart being spectators,"" he said. ""I want the community ... to see us in a new light. We've been on the path for the past year of making sure the community knows us, that they trust us and believe in us.""

Dr. Gary Slutkin, founder and executive director of the organization Cure Violence, which takes a public-health approach to violence prevention, said residents and community groups should also get credit for the reduction in homicides, however slight.

He said his organization and others have ""violence interrupters"" on the streets of the roughest neighborhoods to intervene in gang conflicts before they escalate. The outreach workers, some of them former gang members, stay in touch with friends and relatives of shooting victims in an attempt to prevent retaliation.

""Under the crisis that Chicago had the last two and half years, people have stepped up,"" he said. ""The city, the state, philanthropy, the community groups have stepped up. It's not the most dramatic reduction yet but it's going to be. Next year is going to be much better.""

Even once-skeptical Englewood residents like activist Jahmal Cole acknowledge the benefits of the new policing strategy.

""I hated the idea of police watching us like hawks. But you can't argue with a decline like this,"" Cole, founder of the nonprofit My Block, My Hood, My City, said of the numbers for homicides and shootings.

Neighbors' lax gun laws cited

Though Chicago has a reputation as a murder haven, it didn't have the nation's highest per-capita (murders per 100,000 people) homicide rate. In 2015. Thirteen large cities -- population 250,000 or more -- had higher murder rates . That didn't include a host of midsized cities with more murders per 100,000 residents.

Also, cities such as Atlanta; Washington; Oakland, California; Memphis, Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri, all had higher violent crime rates in 2015.

But Chicago's numerical murder rate has been higher than that of the country's two larger cities , Los Angeles and New York. Johnson was asked whether Chicago's reputation as a violent place bothered him.

""It's frustrating, because when you look at the crime in Chicago, we have our challenges. We have our gun violence,"" he said. ""Chicago is so big that we get a lot of attention because New York and L.A., quite frankly, are seeing bigger reductions than we are.""

Lax gun laws in surrounding states also put Chicago at a disadvantage, compared with New York and Los Angeles, Johnson said.

""We're sitting between Wisconsin and Indiana, who have very lax gun laws, so the illegal flow of guns coming into this city is a lot larger than theirs,"" he said. ""That just means we have more illegal guns on our streets.""",REAL
"Chicago gang members seek new lives through writing, reading memoirs","Chicago (CNN) Just days before his daughter's first birthday in 2006, Leronn Johnson was shot once in the shoulder and twice in his back. He says the bullets remain inside his body, a permanent reminder of the gang life he was part of growing up on the streets of Chicago.

""My shirt went from fresh white to blood red,"" Johnson says. ""Ambulances and firefighters is all I heard.""

On a recent night in Chicago, Johnson was joined by a dozen other former gang members and at-risk African American men in their 20s who are trying to escape gang life.

They're part of a voluntary rehabilitation program that includes writing and reading their own memoirs.

'New Beginnings'

Sitting on a tall director's chair under a spotlight, Johnson read from his memoirs, which he titled ""New Beginnings,"" in front of an audience of more than 100 people.

""It saddens me to have to wake up every day and see these wounds on my body,"" Johnson read into the microphone. ""What if I retaliated and put myself in a hole, which would prevent me from seeing my daughter?""

Former gang member Bruce Knights read from his memoirs he titled ""The Deepest Truth.""

""Why do we live in a world together but yet feel alone? Who truly understands why? Does the pain I receive define who I am? Do I live in a fantasy, or is reality so real that I wish I was living in one?""

Writing and reading their memoirs is part of a program called CRED, or Creating Real Economic Destiny, which places the young men in ""cohort"" groups while teaching them job skills, providing intensive life and trauma coaching, and tutoring toward their high school diploma or GED.

CRED says the memoirs idea came from a program in El Salvador that began in 2012. It targeted gang-affiliated young people in public schools, prisons and juvenile detention centers, with the published works used to engage with families, guards and the general public. The homicide rate in El Salvador hovers around 69 per 100,000. Chicago's rate is about 15 per 100,000.

The Chicago program was launched last year by the Emerson Collective and former US Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who moved back to Chicago after his years working in the Obama administration to find that violence in the city had gotten worse, not better. Duncan, the former CEO of Chicago Public Schools, was part of the audience listening to the men read from their memoirs.

""It's emotional. It's inspiring. It's heartbreaking, but these are remarkable young men, who are telling unbelievable truths and making themselves vulnerable,"" Duncan told CNN.

An honest day's work

The training can last up to 18 months and some of the young men, who had been making thousands of dollars selling drugs on the street, now arrive at learning sessions at 7 a.m. as they work toward getting jobs in manufacturing, retail and construction that pay $12 to $20 an hour.

Duncan said the group's goal, which includes bringing former rival gangs together to try and form a ""brotherhood,"" is simple: ""We want to make Chicago safer, we want to reduce shootings, we want to reduce the homicides. And we work directly with the young men in the communities who are most likely to shoot or be shot.""

Duncan admits that fixing the problem isn't easy. He calls the program ""a work in progress,"" but says he's encouraged by early signs.

""Some of the guys from the first cohort are now mentoring, supervising the other cohorts,"" he said.

""I know we are keeping guys alive. I know we are preventing retaliations, but as a city we have a long way to go.""

Dressed in a black suit, crisp shirt and neatly fitting tie, Lonnie Williams read from his memoirs, ""New Steps and New Moves,"" which described what it was like being raised by an aunt.

""Until this day I can't decide what made me lose respect for my aunt. But between watching her snort coke and being locked in the basement the majority of my childhood, who could blame me? So I left.""

Williams later moved in with his sister and struggled to get by. In his memoir, which he read to an audience that included family and friends, as well as strangers, he said, ""My brother was selling crack, so I chose that as a means to survive.""

After watching his uncle get sentenced to a long prison term, and having a son of his own, Williams is now part of the CRED program in hopes of finding an ""honest life.""

""I think about the 35 years my uncle just got,"" he read, pausing occasionally to look up at the audience. ""Or that my son asks me, 'Dad, why you keep leaving me?' or 'Why don't you love me?' I would be speechless. Although my moves are to protect his future, I also have to remember that I'm a big part of his present. He is getting older and so am I. And to be part of the solution, I have to stop being part of the problem.""",REAL
A force for change: Coping with grief through activism and advocacy,"(CNN) Every tragedy, big or small, leaves behind victims and loved ones whose lives are inalterably changed. In some cases, survivors find themselves driven to become activists or advocates, finding meaning in the tragedy by fighting whatever caused it.

There are many examples making headlines all over the country.

Chris Hurst was an evening news anchor at WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia, when his girlfriend, Alison Parker, a reporter, and her cameraman, Adam Ward, were shot and killed during a live interview one morning in August 2015

Eventually, Hurst left his spot at the anchor desk, inspired to run for office and address some of the issues that led to Parker's death -- though he stresses he's not a single-issue candidate, and gun control wasn't a focus during his campaign.

Also this week, the uncle of Philando Castile -- a black man killed by a police officer last year during a traffic stop -- became a reserve officer in St. Paul, Minnesota . He plans to help be the change he wanted in the department and his community.

Mary Fetchet, a clinical social worker who lives in New Canaan, Connecticut, lost her son, Brad, in the terror attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

When she visited the family assistance center in New York City, set up to provide aid to victims' families, Fetchet said she was ""struck by the magnitude of the event, seeing thousands of families coming from around the country and around the world.""

It was that experience, in part, that led Fetchet to start Voices of September 11th , an organization that works to provide resources to, and address the needs of, September 11 survivors, first responders and victims' families.

""When I think about how it's changed my life, I almost see my life in two chapters,"" Fetchet told CNN. ""Before 9/11 and after 9/11.""

But what drove these people, in the midst of their grief, to try to be the force for change?

Making sense of the insensible

David Kessler, an author, grief expert and founder of Grief.com, told CNN that these families have undergone what he calls the sixth stage of grief: ""Finding meaning.""

""We come away from something so devastating that we go, 'The story just can't end this way,'"" Kessler said. ""Their life needed to matter, and their death needed to have some meaning, so for many people, that spurs us into action.""

Dr. Robin Gurwitch, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who has spent most of her career studying the effects of trauma on children, agreed with Kessler's assessment that some people who deal with a traumatic, insensible loss are looking to find meaning in their suffering.

In the aftermath of a traumatic loss, Gurwitch said, people ask themselves, ""What are some things I can do to honor the life of the person that's no longer here?""

Sometimes that's done by drawing attention to the things that caused the traumatic death, she said.

There are those like John Walsh , who founded the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and started the TV show, ""America's Most Wanted,"" after the abduction of his 6-year-old son, Adam, in 1981. Walsh now hosts CNN's ""The Hunt with John Walsh.""

More recently, Mothers of the Movement , a group of mothers who have lost their children to police violence, are advocating for reform at the cross section of race and policing. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention, they stumped for Hillary Clinton.

But Gurwitch points to the families of children killed in December 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary as examples of people who have made sense of their children's deaths by using their experience to help others. Many of those families started a foundation, she said, focusing on a different piece of what contributed to the loss of their child.

Such causes ""help in terms of recovery and resilience,"" Gurwitch said, but ""there's still going to be those times that are going to be challenging, that are going to be hard.""

Memorializing their loved ones

When people are pushed into advocacy or social work as a result of a traumatic loss, part of the benefit for those affected is in keeping busy, but it's also a way to memorialize their loved ones, explained Joanne Cacciatore, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who studies traumatic grief.

""In my research, one of the reasons that parents most want to get active in volunteering and doing things has to do with remembering, honoring and making sure that the world doesn't forget -- not only this terrible thing that happened, but also the beautiful person (that was lost),"" she said.

In 1996, two years after her own daughter died, Cacciatore started the MISS Foundation , which offers support to families who have experienced the death of a child.

The foundation and ""random acts of kindness"" were the best way to remember her daughter, she said.

""For me, really, compassion was the most powerful thing,"" Cacciatore said. ""It just felt like that was the only way I would survive it.""

Helping others through their experience

Cacciatore isn't alone in feeling that her ability to help others helped her. Some people benefit from altruistic acts, like reaching out to others after a loss, Gurwitch said.

""We know that when people are really struggling, even though you're hurting, if you reach out and try to help someone, it helps you do better,"" she said.

It could be as simple as writing a letter to first responders in your community who were first on the scene of the tragedy, or something as big as creating a foundation to change how the public considers gun control or mental health services, Gurwitch said.

Fetchet, whose son was killed in the 9/11 attacks, said that because of her background in social work, she felt she was ""in a unique position, because I had an understanding of the impact of traumatic events.""

""I almost felt like I had an opportunity and a responsibility to make a difference,"" she said.

'Creating a new future'

Kessler, who dealt with the loss of his 21-year-old son more than a year ago, said the people who are able to move forward and find meaning in their loss are the ones who are ""creating a new future.""

""That loss can paralyze you,"" he said. ""But it can also help you grow in ways that you never thought.""

Fetchet echoed this sentiment. As awful as losing Brad was, his death prompted a change in her life's work, and she's proud of the ""great strides"" she and others affiliated with the Voices of September 11th have been able to make in developing the 9/11 memorial and providing help to victims of the tragedy.

""The loss of my son has had a profound impact on me,"" Fetchet told CNN. ""It was certainly a life-changing event that in a sense expanded my life's journey, personally and professionally.""",REAL
Do we love our guns more than our children?,"(CNN) When I was 12, in the sixth grade in El Cerrito, California, one of my classmates brought a gun to school. She was a bright fellow student -- flamboyant, funny, sometimes moody -- occasionally in trouble, fun to play kickball with. I still remember her throaty laugh. I also remember the awful day while we stood on the play yard, as she pulled a gun out of her backpack and pointed it at a group of sixth-grade girls, threatening to shoot.

I remember how someone saw and called a teacher; how someone got her to the ground and disarmed her. I remember how two men lifted her small body and carried it out of the school, and out of our lives. We were, that day, all spared, and we went on living. That was in 1988, during the same school year the nation was rocked by the Stockton massacre -- the first large shooting on a public school campus, a shooting that took place a few hours from my town. We lived in the vibration of that fear. And as kids, we asked our parents why this would happen, and how to make it better.

Nearly 30 years later, my son goes to the same elementary school I attended. He's in first grade and each day he and other neighborhood kids swing their lunchboxes at the crosswalk before getting in line for class on the same yard I played on at his age.

I am teaching my son how to cross the street safely, how to make playdates, how to read. He has just lost his two front teeth, is starting to read chapter books, and is obsessed with Greek myths. He's learned drills for earthquakes and fires. He's also learning the drill for what happens when an ""unsafe person"" comes to school. He's 6 years old, and he already has had to absorb that each day there's a chance that someone could come and shoot him in his classroom.

I know it too, which is why when my phone flashed with an alert for a shooting in Northern California schools after the Rancho Tehama shooting, my blood ran cold and I had to sit down and let the wave of grief pass over me before I could even read further. I only partly exhaled.

Rancho Tehama is three hours away, but the truth is, it's still too close. Sandy Hook is too close. Sutherland Springs is too close. Las Vegas is too close. Charleston is too close. Any day, any moment, it could be any of us, or any of our children, any of their bright lives. And the question I asked when I was 12 still hangs in the balance: What are we doing to make it better?

Not everywhere is like this. Last year, my family and I left the US to spend time in Northern Ireland, a place not historically known for its peace. As we enrolled my son for school in downtown Belfast, he asked the school principal to describe the school drills. She looked a bit puzzled. She told him about the fire drill. And he asked her ""do you have unsafe person drills""?

As he asked us, all of our faces crumpled. ""No, love,"" she said. ""No, we do not."" And: they don't. Like other developed countries, like most other countries, period, they don't now expect that people might come into their schools and shoot their children.

Living in Europe I could sense how other countries are baffled by the fact that we put up with this. My son also wants to know. I also want to know why we insist on passing on such trauma to our children. I have tried to understand why a city that was caught in shattering decades-long terrorist struggle is now safer for its children than small towns in California or Texas. I have tried hard to imagine what is in the heart of someone who offers ""thoughts and prayers"" after yet another massacre, but says ""it's not the time"" to even learn how to enact sensible regulation of guns.

In the US, we alone bear this burden and this fear: Of the 23 richest nations in the world, according to a 2011 study , we now have 87% of the gun violence, and according to the Journal of TRAUMA Injury, Infection, and Critical Care, 87% of children killed by guns are killed here . Think of it: across the world, 87% of the children killed by guns are killed here, in our country. Breathe into that fact. Imagine all those bright bodies, all the bodies you can, the noses, the eyelashes, the hopes.

When my son looks at me and tries to ask why this is the case, I cannot think what to tell him. I can only believe that for now at least, we are a country that continues to keep loving our guns more than we love our children; that we put our guns above the health of our children, and above the health of each other.

We live in a country where we do not even allow the CDC to study gun violence as the epidemic it is; where we cannot pass the simplest ban on automatic rifles; or where the Air Force fails to keep guns out of the hands of someone it itself noticed was abusive; where men with a history of abusive behavior again and again go on public rampages.

I am tired of living in a cycle where we choose our own trauma and violence over solutions. I am furious at politicians who accept money and then cower before the gun lobby. I am furious that a few loudmouthed interest groups force the rest of us to raise generations of children in fear. I am furious that we do not have adequate mental health services for people in need. I am furious that we are not demanding more of our politicians and more of ourselves. I am tired of treating white male domestic-abusers who massacre people as some kind of unsolvable problem. I can only believe that for now at least, we are a country who keeps loving our guns more than we love our children.

Personally, I've begun to feel that my Second Amendment rights are being violated. I was promised the right to a well-regulated militia, and instead I see a nation that falls victim, week after week, body after body, to a series of unstable people with elaborately hoarded arsenals. I am absolutely sure our founders would be appalled. I am absolutely sure that our founders would not wish that we run out and buy even more guns because of it.

This is a country of hunters and sportsmen, my family included. I cannot foresee an America without guns. I can imagine an America, though, where we act as if our children's lives are worth more than our guns, where we decide that we can no longer tolerate living within a raging epidemic of violence. I can imagine an America where we worry more that a domestic abuser will get a gun and kill someone than we worry about the brief annoyance of a background check. I can imagine an America where we don't imagine we need guns in churches, schools, or Starbucks, national parks.

Thirty years ago, I walked off a field alive. Far too many American children have not been so lucky. It should not be luck. We should be confident in our daily peace. There should be no unsafe person drills here.",REAL
Murder charge dropped in Amazon Echo case,"(CNN) A judge dismissed a murder charge against an Arkansas man in a case that drew national attention when prosecutors sought evidence they believed was stored in an Amazon Echo speaker.

James Bates was charged with first-degree murder in the 2015 death of Victor Collins after a night of drinking and watching football. Collins was found floating face-down in Bates' hot tub, police said.

County Prosecuting Attorney Nathan Smith filed a motion on Tuesday to dismiss the case against Bates, saying the current evidence supports more than one ""reasonable explanation"" for Collin's death, according to court documents obtained by CNN.

""I can't stand in front of a jury and ask them to convict someone beyond a reasonable doubt if I myself have a reasonable doubt,"" Smith told CNN affiliate KNWA

For that reason, the motion states, prosecutor was obligated to request the dismissal of Bates' case at this time.

""I'm 100% innocent,"" Bates told KNWA after the charges were dropped Wednesday. ""I did nothing wrong, I'm not going to hide. I'm going to stay right here.""

The state has one year to refile charges against Bates but his attorney, Kathleen Zellner, said it's unlikely because prosecutors would need ""new evidence.""

""Obviously we are very happy that the prosecution dismissed the case but also have empathy for the victim and the victim's family. This is not a day of rubbing it on anyone's face,"" she added.

For Collins' widow, Kristine, Wednesday's decision was devastating.

""Prosecutors have let us all down today,"" Kristine Collins said.

""I had to go home last night, sit down with my children and explain to them that the person that killed their father, who prevents them from Father's Days and Christmases and a regular life, is going to continue to enjoy those things with his family without any recourse whatsoever for what he has done to mine,"" she added.

The case

The Amazon Echo entered the November 2015 murder case because someone present on the night of Collins' death allegedly recalled hearing music streaming through the device that evening.

Amazon initially rebuffed the prosecution's request but later provided the data after Bates said he would voluntarily hand over the recordings.

According to Amazon, Echo works by constantly listening for the ""wake word"" -- ""Alexa"" or ""Amazon,"" by default -- and then records your voice and transfers it to a processor for analysis so that it can fulfill requests or answer questions. The recordings are streamed and stored remotely, and can be reviewed or deleted over time, Amazon said.

On the night of the incident, Bates had invited two friends -- one of them former Georgia police officer Collins, 47 -- over to his Bentonville home. They watched college football, drank beer and vodka, according to the search warrant affidavit filed in Benton County Circuit Court. The men decided to get into Bates' hot tub and Bates said he went to bed around 1 a.m. When he woke up the next morning, Collins was floating face-down in the hot tub, an affidavit said.

Bates' attorney at the time, Kimberly Weber, said Collins was Bates' friend, and his death was a tragic accident, possibly stemming from his drinking. Collins' blood-alcohol content at the time of death was .32, four times the legal limit to drive in Arkansas, she said.",REAL
US to deport undocumented immigrant acquitted in Kate Steinle death,"San Francisco (CNN) A Mexican man will be deported after he was found not guilty in the killing of Kate Steinle, whose death while out walking on a San Francisco pier reignited a national debate over immigration policy.

Jurors acquitted Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 45, of murder and involuntary manslaughter, as well as assault with a deadly weapon. They convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

The undocumented immigrant faces up to three years in prison, but has already spent more than two years in jail awaiting trial and may get credit for time served. He has not been sentenced.

'I'm not surprised'

Kate Steinle's brother said the theft of the gun set off a series of system failures that culminated with the ruling.

""I'm not surprised. The system failed Kate from the start of this chain of events. Why would the verdict be any different?"" Brad Steinle said. ""From the drug charge. To being released. To not being detained by ICE. The BLM agent leaving a loaded weapon in an unlocked car. It is failure after failure.""

Steinle said the verdict does not affect them in any way.

""Kate is gone. The strength we have is drawn from Kate. Her memory is with us,"" he said.

Debate over sanctuary city

The case sparked a fierce debate over sanctuary cities, and forced San Francisco officials to defend its policy. President Donald Trump invoked the case in decrying sanctuary cities and promoting the construction of the wall along the Mexican border.

A sanctuary city has policies designed to limit its cooperation with federal officials on immigration enforcement.

""San Francisco's policy of refusing to honor ICE detainers is a blatant threat to public safety and undermines the rule of law,"" Tom Homan, deputy director of ICE, said in a statement.

Homan said ICE plans to take custody of Garcia Zarate and ""ultimately remove him from the country."" It's unclear whether it'll be before or after he serves his sentence.

Trump called the verdict ""disgraceful,"" while Attorney General Jeff Sessions said San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city was largely to blame for what happened.

Kate Steinle, 32, was killed in July 2015.

""A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration,"" the President tweeted.

A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2017

Sessions used the verdict to urge local officials to cooperate with federal law enforcement agencies.

""When jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public's safety at risk,"" he said in a statement.

But one of the defendant's lawyers said the debate over immigration didn't belong in the case.

""From day one, this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,"" public defender Francisco Ugarte said.

""Nothing about Mr. Garcia Zarate's ethnicity, nothing about his immigration status, nothing about the fact that he is born in Mexico had any relevance as to what happened on July 1, 2015.""

Assistant District Attorney Alex Bastian said prosecutors were disappointed by the verdict but respected the jury's decision.

""I can't stress this enough, this really is about the Steinle family. They've shown incredible resolve in this whole process,"" he said. ""Our hearts go out to them.""

The case

Prosecutors said Garcia Zarate deliberately fired into an unsuspecting crowd on the pier, killing Steinle as she walked with her father.

But the defense attorney said the shooting was accidental, and the bullet ricocheted off the ground and traveled about 80 feet before hitting Steinle.

Garcia Zarate faced a charge of second-degree murder, but jurors were allowed to consider first-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter convictions.

The jury deliberated for six days before issuing its decision.

Differing accounts

Defense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier. He said it was wrapped in cloth, and when he unwrapped it, it accidentally discharged.

But in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal. He also told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire.

Juors began deliberating Tuesday in the murder trial of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate.

Prosecutors said Garcia Zarate immediately tried to cover his tracks by throwing the gun into the San Francisco Bay, then fleeing the scene.

Garcia Zarate was formerly known as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, one of several aliases he is known to have used. CNN and other media outlets previously identified him as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez.

Immigration debate

Steinle's death reignited the debate over immigration and what role sanctuary cities should play in policy enforcement.

In 2015, Freya Horne, chief legal counsel to the San Francisco County sheriff, said Garcia Zarate was let go because there was no legal cause to detain him.

Steinle's family sued last year, alleging that San Francisco and its former sheriff were partly to blame for her death because officials never notified Immigration and Customs Enforcement when Garcia Zarate was released from a local jail in April 2015.

City officials have said they're not liable for a former inmate's actions. A federal judge dismissed the family's claims.

The Justice Department is considering bringing federal charges against him, according to DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Flores.

The sheriff's department said there is a federal criminal warrant that was signed by a US district judge in 2015 for Garcia Zarate. Once he is eligible to be released, the US Marshals will be notified, authorities said.

Documents unsealed Friday show the warrant was issued in July 2015 after Steinle was killed. An amendment filed Friday adds other violations, including conviction for being a felon with a firearm.",REAL
"Vermont senior tested ricin recipe on retirement community residents, feds say","Story highlights A criminal complaint says the woman was using neighbors to test the potency

She is in custody; attempts to reach her lawyer were unsuccessful

(CNN) The cupboard above the stove in Betty Miller's retirement apartment contained bottles labeled ""apple seed,"" ""cherry seed,"" ""castor beans,"" and ""ricin,"" the FBI says.

The potentially deadly ricin, federal agents allege, was homemade by the 70-year-old to go into the food and drink of her neighbors at a Vermont continuing care retirement community.

Earlier this week, the FBI was asked to come to the Wake Robin life care community in Shelburne, Vermont, to investigate a potentially toxic substance.

When an agent interviewed Miller, she allegedly told him she was making ricin in her home and testing its effectiveness on other residents of Wake Robin.

""On at least three occasions, Miller exposed other residents to the ricin she had produced by placing it on food and/or in beverages she expected them to ingest,"" Special Agent Mark Emmons wrote in a criminal complaint.

How Kate Steinle's case became one of the biggest trials of the year,"Fewer still had heard of Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old medical device sales representative living in San Francisco.

But those two topics have become closely linked since then. And the acquittal Thursday of an undocumented immigrant in her 2015 death became viral breaking news and set off a series of fiercely critical reactions from leading Republican voices across the US.

President Donald Trump called the verdict ""disgraceful."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the death was ""preventable"" and said San Francisco's sanctuary city policies were to blame. Breitbart News for a time on Friday morning focused the top nine stories on its homepage to the verdict, and the hashtag #BoycottSanFrancisco became one of the top trending topics in the US on Twitter.

Why was there such a big reaction to this young woman's death? And how did a murder trial in California become one of the most important criminal cases of the year?

Steinle's case broke through to larger awareness because it touched on several hot-button issues that have recently come to prominence.

And that story largely begins -- as most in today's era do -- with Donald J. Trump.

""For Donald Trump, we were just what he needed -- beautiful girl, San Francisco, illegal immigrant, arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda,"" Steinle's mother, Liz Sullivan, told the San Francisco Chronicle in September 2015 . ""We were the perfect storm for that man.""

San Francisco immigration policy

Prosecutors argued that Kate Steinle, left, was shot and killed by Jose Ines Garcia Zarate.

On July 1, 2015, Steinle was walking on a busy pier of the Embarcadero district in San Francisco when she was killed by a single bullet to the chest.

The man arrested, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 45, was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who had been deported from the US five times previously, according to officials.

He might have been deported a sixth time for a drug-related warrant, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested an immigration detainer and that the agency be notified before he was released.

But officials in San Francisco released Garcia Zarate from custody in April instead of turning him over to immigration authorities. San Francisco is a ""sanctuary city,"" a term that broadly refers to a city that in some way does not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

At the time, though, the term "" sanctuary city "" was not well known. A Google Trends query shows the phrase was rarely searched -- until a sharp spike in July 2015.

Trump picks up the story

Two weeks earlier, Trump had launched his presidential campaign by criticizing US border security, saying that Mexico was sending criminals and ""rapists"" to the US.

The comments faced harsh criticism from leaders across the political spectrum. Sen. Marco Rubio, his opponent in the Republican primary, said his comments were ""not just offensive and inaccurate, but also divisive.""

Steinle's killing came two weeks later. Trump's first tweet about Steinle on July 3 was to offer his "" heartfelt condolences "" to her family. Less than an hour later, he directed his anger at Rubio.

"".@MarcoRubio what do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we can't secure our border? Stand up for US.""

.@marcorubio what do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we can't secure our border? Stand up for US — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2015

In a statement at the time, Trump said Steinle's shooting was further proof of the need for a border wall.

""This senseless and totally preventable act of violence committed by an illegal immigrant is yet another example of why we must secure our border immediately,"" Trump said in a statement. ""This is an absolutely disgraceful situation and I am the only one that can fix it. Nobody else has the guts to even talk about it.""

Talk about it he did. Trump repeatedly brought up Steinle's case on the campaign trail. In his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination , he said he was deeply affected by the stories of parents whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants.

""My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants sanctuary cities,"" he said. ""But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle?""

Other Republicans legislators took his cue. This June, the House of Representatives passed ""Kate's Law,"" a bill that would create harsher penalties for repeat illegal entry to the United States and would expand US law to pressure local cities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The bill has since stalled in the Senate.

The Steinle family's wishes

Garcia Zarate listens in court during his trial in the killing of Kate Steinle.

Lost amid the heightened debate about the case's impact on immigration policy was, well, the evidence and arguments presented in court.

Prosecutors said Garcia Zarate intentionally and recklessly fired into a crowd on the San Francisco pier that day, killing Steinle. But his defense attorney said the shooting was accidental and emphasized evidence that the bullet ricocheted off the ground and traveled about 80 feet before hitting Steinle.

One of the defendant's lawyers said the debate over immigration didn't belong in the case.

""From day one, this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,"" public defender Francisco Ugarte said after the verdict.

In court, there was no mention of the defendant's immigration status, or his past criminal convictions, or San Francisco's immigration policy. Jurors were asked to decide the question: Was there evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooting was intentional?

Similarly, the widespread focus on Steinle's case often had little to do with the family's wishes.

""Sensationalizing it is not the route we would like to go,"" he said. ""If you're going to use somebody's name and you're going to sensationalize the death of a beautiful young lady, maybe you should call and talk to the family first and see what their views are.""

Trump did speak to the Steinle family after that, telling CNN he wanted to leave a period of grieving first.

Even now, the Steinle family has continued to shy away from the spotlight, and have mostly spoken to John Diaz of the San Francisco Chronicle . The Steinles said they were not involved in ""Kate's Law"" and did not know who named it after their daughter.

They also said they were not opposed to sanctuary cities, although they thought San Francisco's then-sheriff went about it the wrong way.",REAL
"For the first time since the end of the Cold War, Hawaii will test nuclear sirens","Story highlights Nuclear warning test will be included as part of regular statewide siren test

Starting Friday, the state will start monthly testing of a nuclear warning siren system aimed at alerting residents to an impending nuclear missile strike. It's the first such tests in the Aloha State since the end of the Cold War.

The test of the nuclear warning siren will be conducted during the monthly tests of the overall statewide warning siren system, according to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.

At 11:45 a.m. on the first business day of every month, a steady alert signal will blare from speakers for 50 seconds, followed by a 10-second pause and then a wailing ""attack warning"" signal for 50 seconds.

In the event of an actual attack, Hawaii's 1.4 million residents are expected to seek shelter immediately after hearing the attack warning signal. An emergency alert system will broadcast warnings on TV and radio as well.

"McDonald's manager to get $110,000 for helping catch Tampa suspect","(CNN) A McDonald's manager who gave police a loaded gun that led to the arrest of a suspect in a series of killings in Tampa will receive a $110,000 reward.

Delonda Walker's tip led to Tuesday's arrest of a man who police said killed four seemingly unconnected people in October and November in the city's Seminole Heights neighborhood. The killings terrified residents, and police swarmed the area for weeks amid an intense search for the killer.

Police and victims' families have praised Walker, the manager of a McDonald's in Tampa's Ybor City neighborhood, but there were questions over what the size of her reward would be.

But those questions were put to rest Friday.

Walker has already received about half of the $110,000 reward, according to Christina Barker, an assistant to Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn.

Police said Howell Donaldson III, an employee at the same McDonald's, had put a firearm in a food bag and gave it to Walker for safekeeping on Tuesday. At about 2:40 p.m., Walker gave the firearm to a police officer in the fast-food restaurant, who then called for backup and detained Donaldson.

She also told police that Donaldson had expressed his intention to leave the state, according to a criminal affidavit.

That firearm was used in all four of the fatal shootings in Seminole Heights, according to the criminal affidavit. Donaldson admitted that the gun belonged to him, leading to his arrest, the affidavit said.

Donaldson is accused of killing Anthony Naiboa, Monica Hoffa, Benjamin Mitchell and Ronald Felton. He faces four counts of first-degree murder.

Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said the gun was a big break in the case that led to the arrest.

""We've had other guns, but we knew this was the one,"" he said Wednesday.

Dugan added that the employee who came forward did the right thing.

""The person who called us -- I cannot thank them enough for standing up and doing the right thing and saying, 'This doesn't seem right, why does this person have a gun in a bag?' ""

'She's a hero to all of us'

The victims, from left: Anthony Naiboa, Monica Hoffa, Benjamin Mitchell and Ronald Felton.

In a statement to CNN affiliate WFTS , Walker said she was ""overwhelmed and surprised"" by the events leading to Donaldson's arrest.

""At this time, I am speaking exclusively with police and am appreciative that they were nearby and quickly acted upon the information I discovered and shared with the police officer,"" she said. ""I am also appreciative of the outpouring of support from the community. My thoughts are focused on the victims and their families and out of respect for them and the active investigation, please direct inquiries to the Tampa Police Department.""

Monica Hoffa's family told WFTS that Walker was a hero for helping solve the case.

""She took all of that worry that was out there away, and she made us all whole again,"" said Kenny Hoffa, Monica's father.

""She's a hero to all of us and our family. She's part of our family now.""

A number of groups had offered rewards for anyone who provided tips that led to the suspect's arrest.

The $110,000 reward comes from several of these organizations, including $50,000 from the FBI, $20,000 from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and $10,000 from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay initially said Walker was not eligible to receive its $5,000 reward money because she did not actually call the tip line, although the group later put out a statement saying the money would be paid out, according to WFTS.

However, local businessman Richard Gonzmart personally delivered a $9,000 check to her Thursday, making good on his promise to contribute to the reward.",REAL

Tax reform is why Republicans haven't turned on Trump,"(CNN) Washington Republicans have spent long stretches of the past 10 months -- their first with unified control of the federal government in a decade -- alternately contending with and rationalizing President Donald Trump's erratic behavior.

That those competing impulses should clash so dramatically, with a former top administration official standing in court on the same day long-desired tax cuts near passage, is a coincidence befitting the opportunity and peril Trump represents for his party.

Some Republicans have groused about him in private, others scolded or lamented him in public remarks; most dodged or demurred when confronted with the controversy du jour. When compelled, a few might issue censorious statements or tweet their concerns. But Trump has carried on, spitting Twitter venom at political foes (and allies he felt slighted by), seemingly oblivious to -- or actively spiteful of -- the sensitive mechanisms and relationships that typically drive policy-making on Capitol Hill.

Republicans in the Senate, and a handful in the House, have been subject to routine humiliations and insults from their President, even as his own team, including campaign officials and his former national security adviser, came under increasing scrutiny for their alleged ties to Russia.

After Obamacare repeal failed and his agenda looked to be falling apart, Trump pressed on, personally demeaning GOP officials who crossed him. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. John McCain, Sen. Jeff Flake, Sen. Bob Corker -- the list goes on -- have all come under attack. The latter pair will retire rather than seek re-election in 2018.

Bob Corker's $1 trillion tax reform problem,"Story highlights Tax plan is slated to add $1 trillion to the deficit, even with economic growth

Corker engaged in negotiations on the Senate floor late Thursday

Washington (CNN) It's (officially) official: The GOP tax plan would add more than $1 trillion to the federal budget deficit over the next decade — even when factoring in economic growth.

And this could put some Republicans — like Sen. Bob Corker — between a rock and a hard place.

The Tennessee lawmaker has previously pledged that he won't vote for a plan that adds a single penny to the federal debt.

For some time, Republicans made a plausible argument: Government estimates, which projected a cumulative $1.4 trillion added to the debt, didn't take into account a boom of economic growth that the tax package would prompt.

But now, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation says economic growth will make up for only $408 billion of that, leaving a gaping $1 trillion hole to fill.

Senate passes sweeping GOP tax plan in early hours of Saturday morning,"(CNN) The Senate passed its tax reform bill in the early hour of Saturday morning, following a day full of Republican leaders making changes to bring enough members on board and a long night full of heated rhetoric on both sides of the aisle.

The vote was 51-49, mostly along party lines. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee was the only Republican to vote against the bill, citing concerns about growing the deficit.

Congressional negotiators continued to make changes to the bill -- including handwriting alterations on to the document -- up until just hours before the final vote, with Democrats sharply criticizing Republicans for not giving members enough time to read the sweeping legislation that would overhaul the US tax system.

The House of Representatives approved its own tax reform plan last month, and the two chambers are expected to go to conference to reconcile the two bills, but passing the legislation Saturday was a huge victory for Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump, both looking for significant legislative achievements.

Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a key holdout, announced just after noon that he would back the plan. Republicans could pass the legislation with 50 members and a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, but after Sen. Susan Collins of Maine announced her support Friday afternoon, Pence's would-be vote was unnecessary, as Collins' vote brought the tally to 51. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee is the only expected Republican to vote no.

""We have the votes,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said walking to the Senate floor following a conference meeting Friday.

Following the vote in the chamber -- which happened just before 2 a.m. ET -- Republicans bestowed a hefty number of backslaps and handshakes with lawmakers who have been integral in the process including Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio. While Senate Whip John Cornyn of Texas stood over the vote tallying sheet watching it closely, McConnell stood to the side. At one point the Majority Leader looked up at Pence, who was presiding, pointed at the VP, winked, and gave him a thumbs up.

In a public statement announcing his support, Flake said he was given promises from Senate GOP leadership and the Trump administration for a ""growth-oriented legislative solution"" to protect recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Republican leaders were racing Thursday night and Friday morning to find support for the bill, hoping to avoid a repeat of the health care bill debacle this summer that left them empty handed. Tensions were running high in the Senate, where Republican tax writers were reworking the tax bill, trying to find a way to satisfy competing interests and shore up votes.

The bill received a major boost Friday morning when Daines announced he would back the bill, after he was assured of ""significant tax relief for Main Street businesses."" Johnson later Friday morning issued a statement supporting the bill.

Senate Republicans met earlier in the Strom Thurmond Room of the Capitol to continue the bill's negotiation Friday morning. Collins, a key undecided vote, said GOP leaders are still ""working through a few more of my issues"" but as she was walking toward the conference meeting, she said, ""We're making great progress.""

But behind the scenes, Republican members and aides were fuming at Corker, who was demanding last-minute offsets for the GOP tax bill out of fear that it would raise the deficit. Corker's demands weren't entirely new , but were crystallized further Thursday afternoon when the Joint Committee on Taxation, the independent tax scorekeeper, announced that even with projected economic growth, the Republican tax bill still would add more than $1 trillion to the deficit over 10 years . Then, Corker learned that a trigger he demanded in the tax bill that would automatically increase taxes if the tax legislation didn't generate the growth that Republicans anticipated, wouldn't pass Senate rules and couldn't be included.

The news led to Corker holding court on the Senate floor on and off for nearly an hour as an amendment vote was held open and dozens of reporters filled the Senate chamber to watch the drama unfold from above.

As CNN reported earlier Thursday , a throng of Republicans encircled Corker and Flake as Sen. Pat Toomey, a member on the Senate Finance Committee who has cut deals with Corker on the tax bill already, stood next to Corker, explaining something at length.

At one point, the Senate's Parliamentarian came over and Corker used his hands to try to convey a point to her for several minutes.

Corker walked across the chamber to speak with Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine. The two men looked over some papers, then walked back over the Republican huddle. Corker asked more questions. At one point Toomey grew audibly frustrated, this time standing face-to-face with the Tennessee Republican.

""Furious,"" one aide responded when asked how GOP senators were responding behind closed doors to what Corker did on the floor. ""Didn't need to be done publicly. Didn't need to cause a scene. We know it's a problem. Fix it behind closed doors.""

Right now, according to aides, staff and senators are working through several different proposals to try to address Corker's issues -- issues that grew more problematic with the JCT report.

Corker, according to aides, wants even more revenue than the trigger would've snapped into effect.

""When the trigger doesn't work, you have to come up with, I think, $350 billion,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina. ""That makes everything different. So, we'll get there, because failure's not an option.""

There were a few options for getting back the revenue, but none of them would satisfy the entire conference. One option, Texas Sen. John Cornyn floated, would be to gradually raise the corporate tax rate, which Republicans had planned to lower to 20% . That would surely upset House Republicans and Trump who had lobbied aggressively to drop the corporate tax rate to 15%. The other option was to not completely repeal the alternative minimum tax , a levy that is used to ensure wealthy individuals cannot just use tax loopholes to avoid paying taxes all together.

But Republicans were still working on how to put the pieces together.

McConnell can afford to lose two Republican senators, but with so many competing concerns, leadership will have to make tough decisions about who to appease based on the math. Flake joins Corker in sharing concerns about the deficit and GOP aides say leaders now view Corker and Flake as a package deal, meaning they either assuage their concerns, or figure out a way not to lose any other senators if they want to pass the bill at all.

Johnson had tried to lobby leadership to give so-called pass-throughs -- businesses that pass profits to owners who pay taxes on the individual side -- additional tax breaks. Collins, who was a key ""no"" vote on health care also must be won over. Collins has asked leadership and the Trump administration to promise her that they will support a package that she says would help stabilize the Obamacare marketplace after Republicans repeal the individual mandate in their tax bill. She has also asked leadership to include a provision that would allow individuals to deduct state and local property taxes up to $10,000.

The predicament leadership faces now isn't all that unlike the one they found themselves in on health care. If McConnell appeases Johnson and boosts the tax break for pass-throughs (which costs money), he could alienate Corker and Flake who have lobbied to make the tax bill less expensive. If he appeases Collins, he could face problems with the Senate bill when it goes to conference with the House.

Collins acknowledged the struggle ahead.

""I'm going to have more discussions with the House,"" Collins told reporters on Thursday evening.

Voyager 1 spacecraft's thrusters fired up for first time since 1980,"Story highlights Voyager 1 is in interstellar space and is NASA's farthest spacecraft

Scientists were looking for a new way to reorient Voyager 1

(CNN) It's a good idea to have a backup plan, especially in interstellar space.

NASA scientists needed to reorient the 40-year-old Voyager 1 -- the space agency's farthest spacecraft -- so its antenna would point toward Earth, 13 billion miles away. But the ""attitude control thrusters,"" the first option to make the spacecraft turn in space, have been wearing out.

So NASA searched for a Plan B, eventually deciding to try using four ""trajectory correction maneuver"" (TCM) thrusters, located on the back side of Voyager 1. But those thrusters had not been used in 37 years. NASA wasn't sure they'd work.

Tuesday, engineers fired up the thrusters and waited eagerly to find out whether the plan was successful. They got their answer 19 hours and 35 minutes later, the time it took for the results to reach Earth: The set of four thrusters worked perfectly. The spacecraft turned and the mood at NASA shifted to jubilation.

""The Voyager team got more excited each time with each milestone in the thruster test. The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all,"" said Todd Barber, a propulsion engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California

Russia investigation 'wearing' on White House,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump , who was already incensed by the idea that his accomplishments weren't getting the credit they deserve, grew more worried on Friday after news broke that Michael Flynn , his former national security adviser and longtime campaign aide, pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI.

""I think that Russia investigation is wearing on all of us, the President most of all,"" said a source close to Trump. ""But I think he is more concerned about the state of his accomplishments and this presidency.""

Flynn's plea is the closest that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the Trump campaign's possible connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 election has come to the Oval Office. It was a dramatic step for an investigation that has infuriated Trump since its creation. Flynn spent countless hours briefing the businessman-turned-politician during the 2016 campaign and was Trump's top national security aide.

How it unfolded

Trump was briefed on Flynn's plea deal on Friday morning, a senior White House official told CNN. The president, the source said, had anticipated Flynn would get swept up into Mueller's investigation for weeks.

Externally, Trump's top aides and surrogates were trying to spin the news as a positive step for Trump that signals Mueller's investigation could soon be wrapping up. A senior White House official said Friday that the president is feeling ""no anxiety"" about the situation.

Another source close to the White House described the President and his team as in denial on the Russia investigation. They are ""totally in a bubble.""

This source said the White House should be taking the Flynn news much more seriously. ""This is like a red alert,"" the source said.

But the source said White House officials said the President expects to be cleared by Mueller's team before much longer.

""They think he's going to be exonerated very soon,"" the source added.

In more reflective moments, though, Trump confidants acknowledge that the President is bothered by the Flynn news, particularly because he is worried that another deluge of stories about Russia could overshadow his achievements.

""Every single one of us has come to expect this, including the President,"" a source close to Trump said of the Flynn news. ""The worry is this could cool down what is otherwise a pretty strong march towards the economic growth we need.""

The source acknowledged that Flynn's plea -- along with indictments of former Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates and another plea by former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos in October -- ""damage Trump's ability to get things done.""

A manifestation of this frustration: As Trump's White House aides devised a communication strategy for Flynn's plea, Republicans in the Senate said they had the votes to pass the Trump-backed tax plan, an achievement the Trump White House has longed for.

Even as aides swore all was well within the White House, Trump was noticeably kept at arms-length for much of the day. When Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj of Libya stepped out of his car, the at-times loquacious Trump ignored shouted questions. And a previously planned photo-op with Trump and al-Sarraj was abruptly canceled as reporters waited outside the Oval Office.

Clearest sign yet

Mueller's court filings are the clearest sign yet of potential coordination between Flynn and a top Trump advisers regarding contact with Russian officials. CNN reported on Friday that Jared Kushner -- Trump' son-in-law and top adviser -- was the ""very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team"" who directed Flynn to contact the Russian ambassador and other countries on an upcoming UN Security Council vote on Israeli settlements.

The probe is now zeroing in on Trump's inner circle , making it harder for the Trump administration to distance itself from the action. When Manafort and Gates were indicted, multiple Trump sources told CNN the indictments had nothing to do with the White House because the duo never worked for Trump as president.

That isn't the case for Flynn, who was Trump's top national security aide for less than a month before he was fired for lying to the Vice President Mike Pence.

Trump, according to multiple sources, considered Flynn a friend, enjoyed his company on the campaign trail and in the White House and believed that the retired United States Army Lieutenant General was an honorable person.

That means even though he canned his longtime aide under pressure in February, Friday's news was likely still difficult to take. Trump said earlier this year that Flynn was a ""wonderful man"" who has been ""treated unfairly.""

The President ""feels sorry for Flynn,"" a senior White House official said, because he ""likes"" the former national security adviser. The official add that Trump is ""thinking about Flynn and his family"" during this time.

One source close to the Trump added that the White House was balancing the fact that ""the President was close to Flynn and spent a great deal of time with him"" and ""the truisms that General Flynn created his own problems here.""

As for a presidential pardon for Flynn, the senior White House official said that was ""absolutely not under consideration.""

While Trump was bothered by Flynn's guilty plea, aides close to Pence feel vindicated because the former national security adviser was fired for lying to Pence in the first place.

Author: Trump made 'p-word' comment in 2000,"(CNN) According to a golf writer, then-citizen Donald Trump in 2000 reportedly offered a vulgar commentary on a woman passing by, and did so with little regard for who might overhear.

Writer Michael Corcoran told CNN's Erin Burnett during a Friday interview that Trump made the remark to him during a 36-hour visit to Mar-a-Lago 17 years ago,

""We just finished playing golf, and we were sitting around on the outdoor patio area, eating area, at the golf club,"" said Corcoran, who was in Florida working on a profile on Trump. ""An attractive young woman walked by and he sort of ... sighed and said, 'There's, you know, there's just nothing in the world like first-rate p-word.'""

In his aired interview, Corcoran paused before saying ""p-word,"" indicating he was sanitizing what he says Trump actually said.

According to Corcoran, there was no secrecy about the remark, and it could have easily been heard by any number of people in the general vicinity.

Sources: Kushner was the 'very senior' transition member,"The court documents provide the clearest picture yet of coordination between Flynn and other Trump advisers in contacting Russian officials to influence international policy, and raise questions about who higher up the chain of command in Trump's orbit -- possibly even including the President himself -- is in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's sights after he agreed to a plea deal with the retired general

The revelations also undermine Trump's often repeated contention that the Russia investigation is little more than a witch hunt being perpetrated by his political enemies.

A person familiar with the transition's effort on the UN vote said it was well-known and a collaborative effort by various transition officials, including Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Flynn and Kushner, adding that none of them ""ordered"" or ""directed"" the others and all were working towards the same goal of standing by Israel.

In court, prosecutors detailed calls Flynn had made in late December 2016 to the senior Trump transition team at Mar-a-Lago to discuss conversations with then-Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak.

The document also says Flynn falsely said he did not ask Kislyak to delay the vote on the UN Security Council resolution.

Flynn faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, according to federal sentencing guidelines, though the judge Friday morning stressed he could impose a harsher or lighter sentence.

Flynn's plea agreement stipulates that he will cooperate with federal, state or local investigators in any way that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office might need, according to a document filed in court Friday. He could also be required to participate in covert law enforcement operations, such as wearing a wire, if asked or to share details of his past dealings with the Trump transition team and administration.

Kushner met earlier this month with Mueller's team as part of the investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 US election, according to two people familiar with the meeting.

""Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so,"" Abbe Lowell, Kushner's lawyer, told CNN on Wednesday.

The conversation lasted less than 90 minutes, one person familiar with the meeting said, adding that Mueller's team asked Kushner to clear up some questions he was asked by lawmakers and details that emerged through media reports. One source said the nature of the conversation was principally to make sure Kushner doesn't have information that exonerates Flynn.",REAL
Tom Hanks: Full support for Hollywood sexual abuse victims,"(CNN) Tom Hanks gave his take on sexual harassment in Hollywood Saturday, noting simply that ""it's everywhere,"" and adding that he hopes ""repercussions land exactly as they should.""

Hollywood has always been a breeding ground for bad behavior, the veteran actor told CNN's David Axelrod on CNN's ""The Axe Files,"" airing Saturday at 7pm ET.

""In a lot of ways we all left town and joined the circus, and the circus is glamorous in a lot of ways. And there is camaraderie and there is sex and there's attraction and there's boyfriends and girlfriends and there's flirting and that's always been part of ... there's on-set affairs,"" Hanks said.

But recent revelations -- which have seen many high-profile Hollywood players, from Harvey Weinstein to Louis CK to Kevin Spacey, accused of sexual harassment and assault -- go ""much farther beyond that,"" he emphasized

""It ends up being a swaying of influence and it becomes part of the marketplace,"" Hanks told Axelrod.

The Senate is about to vote on a tax bill few have read,"Republicans say they have the votes! They're going to pass a massive tax reform bill Friday night that would permanently lower corporate tax rates and undo the Obamacare individual coverage mandate. And a bunch of other stuff. We're not exactly sure about everything it would do yet. Why? Because we haven't read the tax reform bill.

Few have. Even the lawmakers who are about to vote on it. It was still being written, at times in cursive, on the night of the vote.

That didn't keep holdout Republicans from signing on to the bill throughout the day.

Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine said they'd vote yes, virtually assuring passage, probably later Friday night.

That lack of transparency has turned into one of Democrats' major lines of attack in debate on the Senate floor and on social media.

Republicans plan to use special budget rules to pass the tax package using only 50 votes and bypassing a filibuster. Those rules are supposed to help lawmakers reconcile budget deficits, and Republicans have found a way to keep them even though congressional budget scorers said Thursday that the legislation would add $1 trillion to the deficit

Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri tweeted a photo of amendments that she said would be added to the bill but at that point that she had not seen.

""This is so bad. We have just gotten list of amendments to be included in bill NOT from our R colleagues, but from lobbyists downtown. None of us have seen this list, but lobbyists have it. Need I say more? Disgusting. And we probably will not even be given time to read them.""

The broad outlines of the legislation are known, but there were last-minute tweaks being made as Republicans sought to get to the 50 votes they'd need.

""This is a really bad bill for my constituents. I think. Because I will not have time to read it before I am forced to vote on it,"" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on the Senate floor Friday evening.

A lot of this is theater. It's no great secret that most lawmakers don't sit down personally with a highlighter and read the final text of a bill. Details are meant to be hashed out over the course of weeks. But this massive piece of legislation has been pushed at lightning speed, and largely without input from Democrats, who had signaled their united opposition to it.

And the bill senators are likely to pass won't become law. Probably not, anyway. It'll have to be reconciled with the competing bill passed by the House, unless the House decides to take up the Senate version.

When Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, complained about the situation to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor, McConnell argued that Democrats would have ""plenty of time"" to read it and that they know most of what's in there anyway.

""There were four days of hearings in the committee,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""The report has been out at least two weeks. I'm totally confident our friends on the other side are fully familiar with almost all aspects of this and the final version he'll certainly have an opportunity to read, but he's very familiar with the various parts of this. He had plenty of time to look at it in committee, and as I said, there will be plenty of time to read the final version of it before the vote.""

McConnell said that at just after 3 p.m. ET. But still, there was no final text.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, tweeted to McConnell, ""@SenateMajLdr, if you are so intent on forcing middle-class families to foot the bill so your donors can have a tax break, at least have the decency to find a printer. #GOPTaxScam""

A bit before 7 p.m., Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said Democrats had been handed a new version, and he hoisted a 479-page stack of documents.

""479 pages were handed to us,"" Durbin said. ""They tell us that some of this has been around for awhile. Some of it's new. They don't tell us which part is new and which part is old,"" he complained, before picking up a specific page of the legislative text where a staffer had scrawled provisions in cursive.

""We're not even teaching cursive in a lot of schools anymore but someone on the staff knew it to try,"" Durbin said. ""The problem is they wrote it in cursive on the margin here. ... I defy anybody to read it because the problem is when they copied it they chopped off lines so there aren't full sentences.""

Collins, the Maine Republican and a swing vote, did not mention the text when she tweeted about her decision to support the bill.

""After securing significant changes, as well as commitments to pass legislation to help lower health insurance premiums, I will cast my vote in support of the Senate tax reform bill,"" she wrote, before a series of tweets about the changes she recently secured. They're having to write those in before the vote later Friday night.",REAL
#2020Vision: Sanders hits the road; Gutiérrez 'entertaining' 2020 run; Biden 'would say no' right now,"(CNN) Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race:

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders never really stopped campaigning. He's leaving Washington again Friday for a swing through Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania for a series of rallies against the Republican tax plan.

The road trip will bring together MoveOn, which teamed with Sanders for pro-Obamacare events earlier this year, and the political organization spawned from Sanders' 2016 campaign, Our Revolution.

Next Wednesday, Sanders will be in Baltimore for a rally with Maryland gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous. There the former NAACP leader, who already has the backing of Our Revolution, will announce his own statewide ""Medicare for all"" plan.

It all comes after a week in which Sanders endorsedin the race to replace retiring (presidential contender?) Illinois Rep.. No surprise there — Sanders backed Garcia's 2015 (nearly successful) challenge to Chicago Mayor. And Garcia supported Sanders early on in the 2016 Democratic primary. It's mostly notable because Sanders picked so quickly between his allies: 2016 convention delegate and Chicago Alderman, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, is also running in the primary . If Garcia wins, he'll be out of the mayoral mix in 2019, when he was expected to take on Emanuel again — something that had Chicago politicos chattering.

Republicans are paying attention to Sanders, too. The GOP opposition research firm America Rising this week sent a fund-raising email headlined ""President...Bernie Sanders?""

Randi Weingarten. And he's been meeting with international affairs experts such as Bill Perry, a defense secretary in the administration of President Bill Clinton, around a series of speeches designed to define his international vision, one year after running a campaign heavy on domestic policy and light on the rest of the world."" A notable look at Sanders' recent moves comes from Politico's Gabriel Debenedetti , who reports: ""Sanders has been working closely with figures who are close to the party establishment he's long railed against, like American Federation of Teachers President. And he's been meeting with international affairs experts such as, a defense secretary in the administration of President, around a series of speeches designed to define his international vision, one year after running a campaign heavy on domestic policy and light on the rest of the world.""

Luis Gutiérrez is ""at least entertaining the idea of running for president,"" a source familiar with his thinking tells me. ""The very short answer is, he hasn't ruled anything out,"" the source said, pointing to Gutiérrez's news conference announcing his retirement in Chicago on Tuesday and noting that he plans to travel the country ""and energize immigrant and Latino voters."" The source said Gutiérrez plans to visit Western and Southern states — not the typical Iowa and New Hampshire route for presidential prospects — to engage the immigrant, Latino and Puerto Rican communities.

""I'm kinda excited about Luis. He's awesome and can bring something real to the debate. Don't know his chances but he's not a slouch, and is probably one of the more known Latino figures in the country,"" one Democratic strategist emailed me. That person added that white Democrats like Julián and Joaquín Castro, but Gutiérrez has ""more authenticity.""

Dem campaign arm calls on congressman to resign,"Story highlights Rep. Ruben Kihuen was first elected to Congress in 2016

The Nevada Democrat is facing allegation of sexual misconduct in a BuzzFeed report

(CNN) The head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called on Rep. Ruben Kihuen, a Nevada Democrat, to resign after BuzzFeed News published a report Friday, in which a former staffer says Kiheun sexually harassed and inappropriately touched her during his 2016 congressional campaign.

""Members and candidates must be held to the highest standard. If anyone is guilty of sexual harassment or sexual assault, they should not hold elected office. Congressman Kihuen should resign,"" DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján said in a statement provided to CNN.

The woman, who worked as Kihuen's finance director, told BuzzFeed News that Kiuhen made frequent advances and propositioned her despite her repeated rejections. The woman also said that Kiuhen inappropriately touched her thigh on two separate occasions without her consent. CNN has attempted to contact the woman for comment.

The woman said she didn't know how to report her experience at the time, but told BuzzFeed News that she spoke with someone at the DCCC to explain why she was quitting after working for Kihuen for fewer than six months, saying that she felt uncomfortable with the then-candidate. Kihyen's former campaign manager, Dave Chase, was made aware of the woman's complaint. He told BuzzFeed that he confronted Kihuen, who at the time denied any wrongdoing.

In a statement told BuzzFeed and CNN, Kihuen said that the woman was a ""valued member"" of his staff. He did not deny any of the allegations in the story.

Russia investigation zeroes in on Trump inner circle,"Washington (CNN) Michael Flynn's downfall Friday exacerbated grave legal and political risks that represent the most serious threat to any administration for at least 40 years, and could eventually imperil the Trump presidency itself.

The plea deal cut by the fired national security adviser with Special Counsel Robert Mueller undermines much of what the White House has said about the Russia controversy engulfing the presidency.

It means there is now no credible way for President Donald Trump to claim the Russia investigation is a hoax, made up, fake news or a witch hunt.

It raises questions about who higher up the chain of command in Trump's orbit -- possibly even including the President himself -- is in Mueller's sights after he agreed to what appears to be a fairly favorable deal with the retired general

New details about Flynn's conversations with then Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak and involvement in a controversy at the United Nations involving Israel meanwhile raise the possibility that the nascent Trump administration tried to seize control of the levers of state power before it was inaugurated.

Above all, Flynn's plight ensures the dark Russia cloud that has overshadowed everything the administration has done for 10 months is unlikely to lift soon -- and may well thicken.

Legal dimension

Friday's staggering developments did not prove that Trump or other senior aides colluded with Russia to throw the 2016 election -- the centerpiece of Mueller's assignment.

But they make clear that the Mueller probe is marching deep inside the President's tightest inner circle and is threatening officials and family members it would be impossible for him to dismiss as marginal, junior players.

""Not many months ago, the President liked to call this 'fake news' and a fake investigation and a 'witch hunt.' As of today there is no fake investigation, there is no fake news, there is no witch hunt,"" former US Attorney Michael Moore told CNN.

""Mike Flynn, a high-ranking member of the Trump administration, in charge of our national security, has now come in and admitted the allegations are in fact true,"" Moore said.

Mueller's decision to charge Flynn with one count of lying to the FBI on four separate occasions is a relatively limited move that suggests he expects to get significant and sweeping information in return.

The fact that a former national security adviser -- one of the most senior members of the government -- is not Mueller's primary target, as evidenced by the plea deal, suggests Flynn is being used as bait for a bigger fish.

It may be a sign Mueller does not intend to end his investigation merely by indicting people on the charges lying under oath, as some previous independent prosecutors of government wrongdoing have done.

""Normally, somebody who is a national security adviser would be one hell of a Moby Dick ... he is now bait,"" said CNN legal analyst Laura Coates.

The charges that Mueller did choose to lay against Flynn are also revealing.

He specifically chose lies linked to Flynn's conversations with Kislyak about US sanctions against Russia and a UN Security Council vote on Israeli settlements at the tail end of the Obama administration. That is potentially significant because it could widen the circle of the Mueller investigation to people around Trump who were involved in those issues -- possibly including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his son Donald Trump Jr.

CNN reported Friday that Kushner -- a top Trump political adviser was the ""very senior adviser"" who directed Flynn to contact the Russians about the Security Council vote.

JUST WATCHED Comey goes biblical after Flynn plea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Comey goes biblical after Flynn plea 01:42

""The four lies that he picked tell you something very important, that this is an ongoing investigation that implicates a lot of people in the Trump inner circle,"" said former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin. ""This portends a lot of bad news for a lot of people for a lot of reasons.""

In a prosecutor statement released Friday, it was revealed that Flynn called senior transition officials on December 29 last year to discuss his conversations with Kislyak and that there were multiple conversations with the transition team while he was talking with the Russian envoy about sanctions.

The statement did not identify those officials but it sparked intense speculation in Washington about whether Trump was in any way involved in directing Flynn's role in those conversations, or was aware of their content.

""This shows a Trump associate negotiating with the Russians against US policy and interests before Donald Trump took office and after it was announced that Russia had interfered in our election,"" said Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in a statement. ""That's a stunning revelation and could be a violation of the Logan Act, which forbids unauthorized US citizens from negotiating with a foreign power.""

Flynn's admission that he was in close coordination with senior transition team officials also undermines a possible line of defense from the administration -- that he was freelancing and acting on his own volition in his contacts with Kislyak. It also potentially exposes many other key figures who were in Trump's transition and followed him into the White House to Mueller's probe.

Implications

The focus on Russia sanctions is also potentially significant.

US intelligence estimates assess that a Russian effort to meddle in the election was largely motivated by a desire to promote the lifting of US sanctions against leading members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle that also had a damaging impact on the Russian economy.

Flynn's downfall is also a weightier legal threat to the White House than the previous indictments of former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates in October. Those initial Mueller targets were largely indicted for business and lobbying activities and on financial charges not directly linked to the Trump campaign or his transition and presidency.

It was therefore possible for Trump's team to argue that they were peripheral not just to the White House but also to the central question of whether the President or associates colluded with Russia to meddle in the election.

Such a case cannot be made about Flynn, since his charges relate directly to activity during the transition and he has admitted lying to the FBI while actually serving as national security adviser.

Similarly he cannot be dismissed as a minor player, or a ""coffee boy,"" as former Trump foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos was when he entered a plea deal with Mueller in October.

Flynn was the President's constant companion during the campaign. The President asked the former FBI chief to go easy on Flynn before he fired Comey. And Flynn was the man responsible for keeping, and acting upon, the nation's most closely guarded national security secrets.

The legal issues raised for the President and his associates by news of Flynn's plea deal that exploded on Washington may actually pale beside the political dimensions of the now more severe threat posed by the Russia probe.

Despite protestations to the contrary, the White House is under siege and its impact on the political effectiveness of the administration cannot be discounted.

Disclosures about Flynn's behavior only deepen the central intrigue of the the entire episode: Why have the President, his family and aides repeatedly lied about the extent and nature of their contacts with Russians?

Spin doctors

The shocking developments were reflected in the unconvincing early spin from Trump's defenders.

A source close to the President told CNN's Gloria Borger that everybody lies in Washington.

A person familiar with the mood in the West Wing told CNN's Sara Murray that people in the building were ""very happy"" because the charges were about making false statements and not improper actions.

Such a view, however, ignores the potentially sweeping implications of Flynn's cooperation with Mueller.

The President's lawyer Ty Cobb issued a statement noting that the charges against Flynn involved the same false statements that led to his firing, after he lied to Vice President Mike Pence, about his Kislyak calls in February.

Cobb also attempted some political damage control, pointing out that Flynn served for only 25 days as national security adviser and was a former Obama administration official. But a senior aide to the former president noted to CNN's Jim Acosta that Obama had fired Flynn as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and advised Trump not to hire him.

So far, there has been no reaction to the fall of his former close aide from Trump himself. But the President has spent months using his Twitter feed and public events to malign the Russian investigation and incite his followers against it seemingly in an attempt to delegitimize its eventual conclusions.
