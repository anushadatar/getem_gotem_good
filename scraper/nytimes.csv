NORTHPORT, Ala. — Sheila Hayes has followed every twist and turn in the allegations against Roy S. Moore, the Republican Senate candidate who has been accused of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls.

But Ms. Hayes, a community college instructor and a Democrat, felt a jolt of unease when she watched the lawyer Gloria Allred speak at a news conference where a woman accused Mr. Moore of misconduct.

“I like Gloria Allred, but when I saw her on TV, I sort of cringed, because I knew what people in Alabama would say,” said Ms. Hayes, who was wearing a button for Mr. Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. She said she believed the women.

In short order, Ms. Allred, who has represented women in prominent sexual harassment cases for decades, became a character in the scrappy contest that will be decided Dec. 12.

As Mr. Moore has tried to deny the allegations and undermine his accusers, he and his supporters have vilified Ms. Allred. They have raised doubts about the evidence she has presented and have played on some voters’ entrenched mistrust of out-of-state figures by targeting a lawyer known for stepping into the limelight.

“I think she has provided a convenient excuse for Republicans to look the other way, and that’s unfortunate,” Elizabeth BeShears, a Republican communications consultant, said. “Because Roy’s camp has turned this conversation into being about Gloria Allred,” she added, the stories of the accusers “are getting buried.”

For Mr. Moore, a former State Supreme Court chief justice who was effectively removed from the bench twice over debates about the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage, the tactics are those of political preservation in the closing weeks of a race he was favored to win. But the contest, to fill the seat that Jeff Sessions held before he became United States attorney general, was upended when nine women accused Mr. Moore of unwanted advances or sexual assault. One woman, Beverly Young Nelson, made her claim at a news conference in New York alongside Ms. Allred.

Mr. Moore’s campaign began attacking Ms. Allred before the news conference even began, when the campaign chairman, Bill Armistead, called her “a sensationalist leading a witch hunt.” In the weeks since, Mr. Moore has used his Twitter account to point to Ms. Allred’s refusal thus far to allow an independent party to review a yearbook belonging to Ms. Nelson, which, she and Ms. Allred said, contains an inscription written by Mr. Moore around the time of the alleged assault in the 1970s.

“Good Morning, Alabama!” Mr. Moore wrote Friday, in what has become almost a daily ritual. “Day 17 of attorney Gloria Allred’s refusal to turn over her fake yearbook for third party examination.”

In making Ms. Allred a foil, political strategists said Mr. Moore’s campaign had made a calculation tied to a fundamental of Alabama politics: Voters recoil when they sense someone from out of state is seeking to push them one way or another.

“I don’t know that you could say she’s toxic, but she has a reputation of being a self-promoter and a lawyer who shows up with high visibility clients,” said John D. Saxon, an employment and discrimination lawyer in Birmingham who was the chairman of Bill Clinton’s presidential campaigns in Alabama. “The same way people in Alabama don’t want outsiders telling them how to vote, there’s a resentment for that kind of person and, frankly, for that kind of lawyer sometimes.”

Indeed, Mr. Moore’s overarching strategy, besides stoking conservative anger on issues like transgender rights, seems to clash with other national figures, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who called on him to drop out of the race. Late this week, after a character from Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show disrupted a church campaign event for Mr. Moore, the candidate urged Mr. Kimmel to come to Alabama himself.

“Despite D.C. and Hollywood Elites’ bigotry towards southerners, Jimmy, we’ll save you a seat on the front pew,” Mr. Moore wrote on Twitter.

But Ms. Allred has been the target of the campaign’s ire for longer. Ms. Allred, 76, has never shied away from controversy, and became one of the country’s best-known lawyers by taking on high-profile cases relating to abortion, gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment beginning in the 1970s.

Image A copy of a page from Ms. Nelson’s yearbook that was released by Ms. Allred. “To a sweeter, more beautiful girl, I could not say ‘Merry Christmas,’” read the note, which was signed, “Love, Roy Moore D.A.” The Moore campaign has raised questions about the authenticity of the entry.

In a telephone interview, Ms. Allred brushed aside criticisms of her involvement in Alabama and her influence on the Senate race.

“Democrats and the Democratic Party don’t tell me who I should have as a client and what my strategy should be, nor are Republicans permitted to tell me,” she said. “I mean, they can opine, but I don’t take my directions from any party or any person. The only person I serve is my client.”

“I’m a civil rights attorney, I’m a women’s rights attorney,” Ms. Allred said. “Rights for women and minorities are often not popular. Those who advocate for them are sometimes castigated.”

Most of the complaints about Ms. Nelson’s allegations come back to the yearbook that spawned a mix of amateur analyses and conspiracy theories. Mr. Moore and his allies have repeatedly questioned the veracity of the inscription, claiming there are discrepancies between Mr. Moore’s alleged signature and other words that follow in the inscription.

Ms. Allred, who has refused repeated requests by The New York Times and other news organizations to examine Ms. Nelson’s yearbook, said that she would only release it to congressional investigators if a hearing is convened about the allegations against Mr. Moore. A hearing, she said, would offer “a dignified venue where there is testimony that accompanies the examination of all of the evidence.”

Pressed over whether she could guarantee the authenticity of the yearbook, Ms. Allred did not answer directly. She would not comment about whether she had commissioned her own review of the yearbook.

“The most important witnesses in all of this are Beverly, and Roy Moore,” Ms. Allred said. “Why won’t he subject himself to cross-examination and testimony under oath?”

Glen Browder, an emeritus professor at Jacksonville State University and a former Democratic congressman from Alabama, said Mr. Moore and his supporters have seized on Ms. Allred, and the yearbook, to bolster their arguments that allegations against Mr. Moore are an unfair attack.

Other experts said many voters had already made up their minds. The distrust of the allegations was already there, said Joseph Smith, the chairman of the political science department at the University of Alabama.

And some women in Alabama are simply grateful Ms. Allred has taken up the cause. “When I see Gloria Allred and she’s beside someone, it verifies their creditably,” said Sheila Gilbert, the chairwoman of the Calhoun County Democratic Party.

As the lingering questions about the yearbook have become fodder for conservative outlets — including Breitbart News, where the executive chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, is a vocal supporter of Mr. Moore — they have also begun to exasperate some supporters of Mr. Jones.

“Frankly, I think it should be produced,” said U. W. Clemon, a retired federal judge who supports Mr. Jones. “Any corroboration that will put to rest a claim that he does not know this woman would be very helpful.”

For Julie Lowe, 56, a bartender, the doubts about Ms. Allred, whom she finds “fishy,” were enough to cut through her confusion over the allegations against Mr. Moore.

“I think it’s kind of trying to sabotage him,” Ms. Lowe, an independent voter, said. “He’ll most likely get my vote.”

Ms. Allred, for her part, said that the attacks reflect attitudes about accusations of sexual misconduct, and that she did not regret the approach she has taken.

“Is it popular in some places for some people in Alabama to care about women over the denial of a powerful man?” she said. “Maybe not, O.K.? But Beverly is now empowered. The women are empowered. There’s no going back now.”

"Deported Repeatedly, Man Is Sentenced to 35 Years for Attacks on 2 Oregon Women","Amity Girt, the deputy district attorney who handled the case for the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office, said that Mr. Martinez pleaded guilty on Friday to 10 charges, including sodomy, assault and robbery. His 35-year sentence does not include the possibility of an early release.

“There were two victims in this case who either directly or through family members presented very gut-wrenching-to-hear impact statements in court today,” she said in a telephone interview late Friday.

Mr. Martinez’s lawyer, Jonathan Sarre, said his client had chosen to take the plea deal against his advice. Mr. Sarre said he thought it might have been possible to negotiate for closer to 20 years of prison time.

Still, in a telephone interview, Mr. Sarre said he had a “problem with using an individual person to advocate for strict immigration laws.”

After Mr. Garcia Zarate’s acquittal on Thursday, “Mr. Martinez becomes the immigration boogeyman that the administration all wants us to fear,” Mr. Sarre said. “He’s the poster boy for the border wall. It’s a great way to scare people.”

KOIN 6 News in Portland reported that one of the victim’s brothers told Mr. Martinez in court on Friday to “rot in hell.” The station also said that as Mr. Martinez exited the courtroom, he told the victims’ families: “See all you guys in hell.” Mr. Sarre confirmed that an exchange like that occurred, and noted that his client has suffered from mental illness; a psychologist found him competent enough to stand trial, Mr. Sarre said.

Mr. Martinez has a long list of what his lawyer said were relatively minor crimes like low-level drug offenses, disorderly conduct and other petty misdemeanors. The most serious crime Mr. Sarre said he was aware his client had committed before the July assaults was a burglary in California for which he was deported.

Mr. Martinez had been in jail in Multnomah County serving time for a drug offense when he finished his time and was released last summer, Mr. Sarre said. About two weeks later, Mr. Martinez assaulted the two women.

Cases like that of Mr. Martinez have pitted local sheriffs against the Trump administration in what has often devolved into a blame game. When the White House criticized the Multnomah County sheriff, Mike Reese, for letting Mr. Martinez go, Sheriff Reese argued that federal immigration authorities were at fault for failing to provide a legal basis for him to hold Mr. Martinez longer.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has spoken publicly about the case and several others like it, arguing that releasing potentially deportable immigrants when their jail terms expire does “far broader damage to the country than many understand.”

The sheriff’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment on Friday night. A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement told The Associated Press it would seek to have Mr. Martinez transferred to its custody when he completes his sentence so that the authorities can deport him.

He would be 66 at that time.

“I’ve done everything from traffic tickets to murder,” said Mr. Sarre, who also represented Mr. Martinez for the offenses that landed him in jail in the weeks before the July assaults. “I don’t think anyone could have expected this to turn out the way it did or for this to happen.”

He reiterated something he said a colleague had told him — that Mr. Martinez had “ruined it for every other hardworking person who doesn’t have papers.”

Harvard Agrees to Turn Over Records Amid Discrimination Inquiry,"Photo

Harvard University has agreed to turn over years of confidential applicant and student records to the United States Justice Department, which has opened an aggressive investigation into whether the university has systematically discriminated against Asian-American applicants, officials said Friday.

It was the first time that Harvard had agreed to provide access to records under terms that the Justice Department seemed receptive to. But it added a condition that allowed government lawyers to look at the records only in the offices of Harvard’s lawyers, according to people close to the case.

That condition could make it difficult to do the kind of statistical analysis that the government has said it wants to do. But Harvard has justified it by saying that it wants to protect confidential documents from possibly being leaked to the public.

The Justice Department sought records for thousands of high school students — 160,000 by one estimate — and when Harvard resisted, citing confidentiality, threatened to sue the university if it did not turn over the records by Friday.

Responding to that deadline, Harvard offered a compromise position in which the government’s lawyers would be able to examine all the records, including an electronic database, in the offices of Harvard’s lawyers, with some personal information redacted.",REAL
Trump Tweets ‘Build the Wall’ After Immigrant Is Acquitted in Kathryn Steinle Case,"“The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!,” he wrote in the first of a pair of tweets.

“For anyone that would question the outcome in this case, this jury was deliberating for six days,” Jeff Adachi, the San Francisco public defender, said after the verdict. “There was a tremendous amount of misinformation that was spread about this case from Day 1. You had then-candidate Trump espousing that this was an intentional shooting.”

In a telephone interview, Alex Bastian, an assistant district attorney in the office of the San Francisco district attorney, George Gascón, said the verdict “was not the one we had hoped for.”

“Both the prosecution and defense worked very hard in litigating this case,” he said. “At the end of the day, however, it is up to the jury to determine what they believe is an appropriate verdict. They came back the way they did and we will respect the jury’s decision.”

After the verdict was read, the victim’s father, Jim Steinle, told The San Francisco Chronicle, “We’re just shocked — saddened and shocked.”

“There’s no other way you can coin it,” he said. “Justice was rendered, but it was not served.”

In a statement, a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said that after the conclusion of the case, the agency would “work to take custody of Mr. Garcia Zarate and ultimately remove him from the country.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime hard-liner on immigration enforcement who has threatened to strip federal funds from cities like San Francisco because of sanctuary policies, responded to the verdict in a statement.

“San Francisco’s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle,” he said. “The Department of Justice will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens. I urge the leaders of the nation’s communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers.”

Jurors declined to speak to the media, a court spokeswoman told The Chronicle.

Ms. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father’s arms. Mr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident.

Evidence was presented in court that the bullet had ricocheted before striking Ms. Steinle.

Mr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions. He had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again.

The backlash to his release crescendoed when Mr. Trump cited the case during the campaign.

In a major speech on immigration in August 2016, Mr. Trump argued that “countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws.”

Mr. Trump then named several young people who he said had become victims of policies he considered failures. Among those he named was Ms. Steinle, who Mr. Trump said had been “gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times.”

“And they knew he was no good,” Mr. Trump said of the man who had shot her.

Unlike some other families whose personal tragedies have become political talking points, Ms. Steinle’s parents have largely avoided the news media. But, at times, they have acknowledged the utility to politicians of their experience.

“For Donald Trump, we were just what he needed — beautiful girl, San Francisco, illegal immigrant, arrested a million times, a violent crime and yadda, yadda, yadda,” her mother, Liz Sullivan, told The Chronicle. “We were the perfect storm for that man.”

In June, the House approved a bill known as Kate’s Law that would stiffen penalties for immigrants caught illegally re-entering the country after being deported. It was received in the Senate about two weeks later, where it has apparently stalled.

After the verdict, the lead defense lawyer in the case said Mr. Garcia Zarate’s immigration status was not relevant to the crime, an argument he said he had posed during jury selection.

“I think it brought home the idea that, ‘Hey, you know what, if he committed murder, prove it,’” the lawyer, Matt Gonzalez, said in an interview. “But you can’t just convict him because he’s not from the United States.”

Still, conservative commentators, including Bill O’Reilly and Ann Coulter, quickly condemned the verdict.

“Jury convinced that illegal alien killed Kate Steinle accidentally,” Ms. Coulter wrote on Twitter. “She would still be alive if we had a wall.”",REAL
White Supremacists Were Ready for Violence in Charlottesville. The Police Were Not.,"The city manager, Maurice Jones, released a statement praising the work of Mr. Heaphy and his team, “although we do not agree with every aspect of the report’s findings.” He said that on Monday, city officials will present to the City Council a proposed set of new policies in response to the August unrest. The city police declined to comment on the report.

White supremacists focused on Charlottesville, known as a liberal bastion, in part to oppose the removal of statues of Confederate generals from city parks. Following smaller rallies in the city, in May and July, they organized a “Unite the Right” event on Aug. 12.

The violent protests became an international news event, and then a political furor after President Trump equated the two sides, refusing to explicitly condemn protesters who chanted Nazi slogans and carried white supremacist symbols.

Mr. Heaphy’s firm interviewed witnesses, examined video and still photographs, and reviewed half a million pages of documents. What emerged, he said, was a failure to prepare, a failure to inform the public about what to expect, and a failure to protect people.

The Charlottesville police had not been trained in handling civil unrest, and did not consult with other departments around the country that had relevant experience, the report said.

Many officers “had never even tried on the ballistic helmet or used the shield that they were given that day,” Mr. Heaphy said at a news conference. “We talked to a lot of police officers who really didn’t have a sense of what they were asked to do.”

The Police Department and the State Police did not coordinate efforts — state officials did not even give their tactical plan to the city police — and the two groups could not talk to each other on their radios. Unknown to the city police, Mr. Heaphy said, “the state police were told, ‘You are here to protect the park,’” and not to respond to violence.

Days before the rally, City Council members insisted that the site be changed from Emancipation Park to another location, over the Police Department’s objections. Though that plan was eventually dropped, it hindered preparations.

The night before the Aug. 12 rally, Unite the Right forces marched without a permit onto the University of Virginia campus, carrying lit torches. At the base of a statue of the university’s founder, Thomas Jefferson, they fought with a smaller group of opponents.

“University officials were aware of this event for hours before it began but took no action to enforce separation between groups,” the report said. The university refused repeated offers of aid from the city police, until after the event had descended into a melee.

During the main rally, the police did not keep the factions apart, and officers were stationed around the protesters, but not in the crowd, where they could have responded to incidents more quickly. At first they did not have riot gear with them — as violence escalated, officers had to leave to retrieve the equipment from staging areas blocks away.

When the police finally moved in, forcing the crowd out of the park and onto city streets, the violence worsened. “When violence was most prevalent, C.P.D. commanders pulled officers back to a protected area of the park, where they remained for over an hour as people in the large crowd fought on Market Street,” the report said.

The city’s plan to control the streets “essentially was much like it is on Saturday afternoon for a football game,” without the resources needed for mass unrest, Mr. Heaphy said. It relied on officers and unarmed personnel directing traffic, he said, and “they were told, if it gets dangerous, if it gets violent, go inside your car and lock the doors.”

A single Charlottesville officer, normally assigned to schools, was posted with a patrol car at an intersection on 4th Street to keep it closed to vehicles. She grew afraid for her safety and called for help, but her superiors told her to leave her post and no one was sent to take her place.

Without the officer and her car, all that blocked the street was a wooden sawhorse, and vehicles easily drove around it and into the crowd — including the one that killed Ms. Heyer.",REAL
"A Hasty, Hand-Scribbled Tax Bill Sets Off an Outcry","Photo

WASHINGTON — By midafternoon on Friday, Republicans had the votes to pass their tax bill in the Senate. What they did not have was a bill.

The legislation, covering nearly 500 pages, finally surfaced well after the sun had set. It appeared first in the lobbying shops of K Street, which sent back copies to some Democrats in the Senate, who took to social media to protest being asked to vote in a matter of hours on a bill that had yet to be shared with them directly.

The drafts that leaked to journalists included changes scrawled in looping handwriting in the margins. Democrats posted screenshots and accompanying complaints. Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, called it “Washington D.C. at its worst” in a video in which he held up a page of the bill with the changes.

“This is unbelievable, we’re doing massive tax reform on an absolute incredible timeline,” he said. “This is going to affect everybody in this country.”

With Republicans intent on passing a bill along party lines, public protests have been Democrats’ only weapon throughout the lightning-fast progression of the bill over the last month. The minority party has no ability to stop the bill, because Republicans are employing a Senate tactic that allows them to bypass a Democratic filibuster. The first version of the tax plan was introduced in the House on Nov. 1 and approved two weeks later; the Senate is on course to match that pace.

That would be a compressed schedule in any event, but it was particularly so on Friday, as Republicans inserted several last-second amendments to secure majority support for their bill. Democrats could only scold and work up a frenzy on social media.

In a separate video, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, held up a stack of legislative text and tried to read the changes that the Republicans had made. She struggled to make sense of the garbled language and lamented that she could not possibly read the bill in the hour or so before the expected vote.",REAL
Flynn’s Guilty Plea Looms Over a White House on the Verge of a Tax Cut Success,"Still, former Representative Mickey Edwards, Republican of Oklahoma, said Mr. Trump’s unconventional political appeal might yet minimize the consequences that other presidents might have endured.

“In any normal White House, and with any normal basis for presidential support, the Flynn story would be crippling,” he said. “This president’s support base is small but apparently unshakable, and with Republicans in Congress showing a frightening unwillingness to hold this president to account, I don’t expect this development to change the behavior of either Congress or the president.”

Mr. Flynn was the highest-ranking current or former White House official to be convicted of a crime connected to his time in office since two national security advisers to President Ronald Reagan — John M. Poindexter and Robert McFarlane — were found guilty during the Iran-contra scandal. Mr. Poindexter’s conviction was later reversed on appeal and Mr. McFarlane was pardoned by President George H. W. Bush.

Almost everyone in Washington, it seemed, had expected an indictment of Mr. Flynn, and the possibility that he was cooperating with prosecutors was telegraphed last week with the news that his defense lawyers had cut off contact with Mr. Trump’s lawyers.

And yet the announcement on Friday still hit the White House like a thunderclap. The president’s legal team had no advance warning. His chief of staff, John F. Kelly, learned about it from television. He called Mr. Trump, who was still in the residence part of the White House, to let him know he would be hearing about a Flynn plea deal soon. The president’s reaction, according to one adviser, was that Mr. Flynn “is in a lot of trouble.”

Whether that fear turned into something more immediate about himself or his family, Mr. Trump did not vocalize it, the adviser said. His staff urged him to stay off Twitter, and for the most part, he complied. The president had a cordial, if at times awkward, lunch with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, and then used Twitter to deny any plans to fire him. In the afternoon, Mr. Trump stopped by a White House Christmas party for reporters but stayed less than five minutes.

The president’s optimistic outlook last weekend was fueled by his White House lawyer, Ty Cobb, who has consistently assured him that the investigation by Mr. Mueller would most likely conclude by the end of the year. Mr. Cobb has successfully persuaded Mr. Trump for the most part to curb his combative instincts and work in the parameters of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, turning over requested documents and avoiding incendiary attacks on the prosecutor.

But Mr. Trump has been slipping free of Mr. Kelly’s restrictions for several weeks, speaking with old friends by telephone during his Mar-a-Lago trip and becoming incensed all over again about the Russia inquiry. Friends said he was particularly excitable in his phone calls in the days leading up to Mr. Flynn’s guilty plea, a mood that seemed reflected by a week of lashing out on Twitter at various targets other than the investigators.

He has been so fitful that at one point during his stay in Florida, he told some club members that he was not fretting about whether Senate Republicans would pass his tax proposal because he had “a plan.” If the Senate failed to approve his tax cuts, Mr. Trump told them, he would refuse to sign a new short-term spending bill financing the government, forcing a partial shutdown.

Aides insist that Mr. Trump is not consumed with the Russia inquiry more than he has been at other times. Yet he has been leaning on Mr. Cobb, constantly summoning him to the residence and dialing another lawyer on his team, Jay Sekulow, for consultations, people briefed on the discussions said.

The White House made a point of playing down any appearance of concern on Friday. A statement issued by Mr. Cobb diminished Mr. Flynn’s importance by noting that he served as national security adviser for only 25 days before being fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and others about the details of his conversation with a Russian ambassador.

The statement also sought to distance the president from his former aide by calling Mr. Flynn a “former Obama administration official,” which was not exactly the full story. During President Barack Obama’s administration, Mr. Flynn was an active-duty lieutenant general who was promoted to direct the Defense Intelligence Agency, but he was not a political associate of the president, and Mr. Obama fired him.

Mr. Flynn became one of Mr. Trump’s most visible and vocal supporters during the presidential campaign last year, giving a memorable stem-winding speech at the Republican National Committee in which he assailed the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and led the crowd in chants of “Lock her up.” The irony of that phrase was lost on no one on Friday.

Mr. Trump reportedly tried to protect Mr. Flynn from this day. James B. Comey testified before Congress in June that when he was F.B.I. director, Mr. Trump asked him to “see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.” Mr. Trump, who fired Mr. Comey, later disputed that account.

Mr. Comey’s firing led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Not only was the investigation into Mr. Flynn not let go, it now poses an unknown potential threat to Mr. Trump’s White House.

Mr. Comey offered his own take on the turn of events on Friday with an Instagram post quoting Amos 5:24, “But let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.”",REAL
"Trump to Keep Embassy in Tel Aviv, but Recognize Jerusalem as Capital","With another deadline looming next Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to sign an order keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv. But he will couple that with a statement that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital — something that no president, Republican or Democrat, has done since the state of Israel was established in 1948.

Given the extreme sensitivities surrounding Jerusalem, Middle East experts said Mr. Trump’s plan was fraught with risk. Even after extensive consultations with Arab leaders, which the White House has done, such a move could provoke volatile reactions.

“The devil is in the details of what they announce,” said Martin S. Indyk, who served as American ambassador to Israel under President Bill Clinton. “If this is not framed properly, far from resolving this issue, it will land the administration in even hotter water.”

Among the questions, Mr. Indyk said, are whether Mr. Trump will restrict recognition to West Jerusalem, whether he will mention Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem and how he will deal with Jerusalem’s status as a holy city — a factor that could determine whether Saudi Arabia supports or abandons his peace project.

News of Mr. Trump’s decision came amid fresh disclosures about how, even before he took office, he worked closely with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to scuttle a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israel’s settlement policy — subverting then-President Barack Obama, who had decided to allow a vote to go ahead.

Documents filed in connection with the guilty plea of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, revealed that on Dec. 22, 2016, a “very senior member” of Mr. Trump’s transition team instructed Mr. Flynn to contact foreign officials, including from Russia, “to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.”

Lawyers identified the senior transition official as Mr. Kushner. Russia rebuffed Mr. Flynn’s request and voted for the resolution, which passed after the United States abstained.

Mr. Trump has kept up his close relations with Mr. Netanyahu, though that may be tested if, as expected, the White House tries to jump-start peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians early next year.

While Mr. Netanyahu supports the decision to move the American Embassy, Israeli officials have not pushed the issue in recent months. Other leaders in the region, like King Abdullah II of Jordan, remain deeply opposed to it.

But Mr. Trump was under immense pressure from pro-Israel and evangelical supporters and is likely to repeat past assertions that it is not a matter of if, but when, the embassy will be moved to Jerusalem. He is also being pressed to declare that next week’s waiver will be his last — effectively promising to devise a plan by mid-2018 to begin relocating the embassy.

Declaring Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital would not itself mark a change in American law. In 1995, Mr. Clinton signed a statute declaring, “Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital of the State of Israel.” But administrations have been allowed to decide, as a matter of policy, whether to recognize it as the capital, and none have done so.

That law requires the embassy to be moved to Jerusalem, unless the president issues a waiver finding that doing so would be against national security interests of the United States. American presidents have done so every six months since then to avoid prejudging the outcome of — and therefore hampering — an eventual resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump vowed to change course. At the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in March 2016, he said he would “move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.”

But he signed a waiver on June 1, and officials said Mr. Adelson was among the supporters who were deeply disappointed by the president’s decision.

Among those pressing hardest for moving the embassy, said people close to the deliberations, was Vice President Mike Pence, who has been a conduit for Mr. Trump to religious conservatives. In a speech in New York on Tuesday, he said Mr. Trump was “actively considering when and how to move the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.”

In the short run, the decision could complicate plans for Mr. Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump’s special envoy, to restart peace negotiations. Palestinian officials have warned that Mr. Trump is “playing with fire.”

“If you’re trying to be creative by saying we’re recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, you’d better qualify it,” said Dennis B. Ross, a longtime Middle East peace negotiator. “If you don’t qualify it, that means you’ve just accepted the Israeli position on the final status of Jerusalem, which means you’ve lost the Arabs.”",REAL
California Resolute in Sanctuary Status as a Heated Case Ends,"“California’s local law enforcement cannot be commandeered and used by the Trump Administration to tear families apart, undermine our safety, and wreak havoc on our economy,” Kevin de León, the Democratic leader of the State Senate, said in a statement when Mr. Brown signed the law, calling it “a wall of justice against President Trump’s xenophobic, racist and ignorant immigration policies.”

But while the fight over immigration has become symbolic of California’s role as a leader of the Democratic opposition to the president, the only fiery remarks over the last two days have come from Mr. Trump and other Republicans, a sign of the delicate position for leaders here in the face of the death of an American citizen.

After the acquittal, Mr. Trump called again for the construction of a border wall and threatened to use Ms. Steinle’s death against Democrats, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions again criticized sanctuary cities for “having put the public’s safety at risk.”

The reaction in California was far more muted. “San Francisco is and will always be a sanctuary city,” a spokesman for Edwin M. Lee, the city’s mayor, said in a statement, declining further comment.

Supporters of sanctuary policies say they build trust with immigrant communities and ultimately stop crime, and have argued that Ms. Steinle’s death was an aberration that was unfairly turned into political fodder. They say the policies also protect undocumented immigrants who are otherwise law-abiding, but opponents counter that such immigrants should not be immune from deportation.

“There is nothing more repugnant than the racist exploitation of tragedy and I think that people of California have a heightened sensitivity when that happens,” said Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which pushed for the statewide legislation.

In a poll this year by the Public Policy Institute of California, respondents were split when asked if they supported the new state law — 48 percent said they were in favor, compared with 42 percent who said they were opposed. Some of the support, said Mike Madrid, a Republican consultant based in Sacramento, may have had as much to do with feelings about Mr. Trump than about support for undocumented immigrants.

“This has become more than an immigration and economic issue, it’s become a cultural issue,” Mr. Madrid said. “This happened in California, the place that has become the beating heart and center of the resistance. Everyone is going to get out their shovel and dig deeper.”

Ms. Steinle’s parents — who, unlike other relatives of victims killed by undocumented immigrants, never appeared alongside Mr. Trump during the campaign — personify the difficulty of fitting the killing into the immigration debate. They have said that they support the concept of sanctuary cities, but that San Francisco officials made a mistake in releasing Mr. Garcia Zarate.

The family was not in the courtroom when the verdict was read on Thursday, but told The San Francisco Chronicle they were “shocked and saddened.”

At the time of the shooting, Mr. Garcia Zarate had a criminal record that included seven felony convictions, and he had been deported from the United States five times. He spent almost four years in a federal prison for illegally re-entering the country, then was sent to jail in San Francisco because of a warrant for a 20-year-old felony marijuana charge, which a local court dismissed almost immediately.

Federal officials said they issued a request to be notified when he would be released from jail, noting that they had an order for deportation. But the sheriff who runs the jail said that the city’s sanctuary ordinance meant that he could only respond to immigration authorities if they had a formal court order, which are rare with immigration charges. Mr. Garcia Zarate was released, and later that year, fired the gun that killed Ms. Steinle.

During the trial, lawyers for both sides reminded jurors that they were there to decide a criminal case, not debate immigration issues. Defense attorneys argued that Mr. Garcia Zarate had found the gun on the pier and fired it accidentally, which created enough reasonable doubt in juror’s minds against prosecutors’ claims that he had intentionally killed Ms. Steinle. Mr. Garcia was acquitted of murder, manslaughter, and assault with a firearm, and was convicted only of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

On Friday, federal officials moved to avoid a repeat of Mr. Garcia Zarate’s release. They secured an arrest warrant accusing him of violating his supervised release from prison, which will allow them to take custody of him for possible prosecution and deportation.",REAL
"Debt Concerns, Once a Core Republican Tenet, Take a Back Seat to Tax Cuts","All but one Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, appeared set to vote for the bill on Friday.

The House and the Senate would still have to reach final agreement on the details, and Mr. Trump would have to sign his name, but the Republican Party now stands on the verge of driving up the national debt after spending much of the last decade promising rectitude and criticizing Democrats for profligacy.

The legislation reads “as if it were developed for a country whose debt problems have been solved, when in reality debt is the highest it has ever been other than around World War II,” declared the co-chairmen of a bipartisan commission created in 2010 to propose measures for reducing the debt.

Alan Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and Erskine Bowles, formerly President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, said the current crop of Republicans are avoiding “nearly all the hard choices.”

Mr. McConnell has a well-documented history of fretting about the debt.

“We’d like to do something about the nation’s biggest problem, spending and debt, which of course is the reason for this economic malaise,” he said in 2011. He added that Republicans could not address the problem because they did not control the White House or Senate.

Last year, with Republicans in control of the House and the Senate and about to claim the White House, he reiterated his distaste for debt. “I think this level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable,” Mr. McConnell said. “My preference on tax reform is that it be revenue neutral.”

He continued in words that now seem particularly striking. “What I hope we will clearly avoid, and I’m confident we will, is a trillion-dollar stimulus,” he said. “Take you back to 2009. We borrowed $1 trillion and nobody could find that it did much of anything. So we need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly.”

This week, the congressional scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, reported that the Senate’s tax plan is, in fact, a stimulus plan that costs $1 trillion — the amount it would add to the debt over the next decade after accounting for its significant economic benefits.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who shepherded the House’s version of the tax bill — which also would add $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade — has assiduously cultivated a reputation for concern about the federal debt.

In 2011 he released “The Path to Prosperity,” a budget plan proposing large spending cuts to balance the books. He said fiscal discipline was unpopular but necessary.

“What I do know is I can’t look my kids and my constituents in the eyes with my conscience being clear and not know that I didn’t do everything I could to try and fix this problem,” Mr. Ryan said in a 2011 interview with CNBC.

In 2013, he said the debt “will weigh down our country like an anchor.”

At the time, the federal debt held by investors equaled 72 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. The Republican tax plan could push that to 85 percent by 2021, Goldman Sachs estimated Wednesday, which would be the highest debt ratio since the immediate aftermath of World War II.

Republicans are gambling that voters would rather have tax cuts now and worry about debt later. That is certainly the position of the corporate sector, which has abandoned pious expressions of concern about Washington’s extravagance in favor of earnest pleas for tax relief.

“Passing tax reform is the single most important thing that Congress can do to make American companies more competitive,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, said last month.

A number of prominent Republicans have defiantly insisted that economic forecasters are wrong about the likely cost of the tax cuts. They say the legislation will cause a surge of economic growth that will allow the government to collect just as much money at lower tax rates.

Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, dismissed the analysis of the economists Congress employs for that purpose, using techniques he has endorsed, as “curious.”

The Trump administration, without offering evidence, continues to insist the federal debt will not rise.

Republicans also have long distinguished between deficits caused by spending increases and deficits caused by tax cuts. They argue that tax cuts are good for the economy, and that the resulting problem of larger deficits should be addressed by reducing government spending.

“You also have to bring spending under control,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week. “And not discretionary spending. That isn’t the driver of our debt. The driver of our debt is the structure of Social Security and Medicare for future beneficiaries.”

The tax cuts, however, would increase the scale of that challenge.

Politicians of both parties also have lost their fear of debt in recent decades. The federal debt has grown much larger than was considered wise or even possible, with few apparent consequences.

“Reagan proved that deficits don’t matter,” Vice President Dick Cheney said in 2002. Many Republicans take the view that the George W. Bush administration’s tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 proved the same point.

But federal borrowing imposes real economic costs, not least the need to make interest payments. It also restricts the funding available to private-sector investors. And experts continue to warn that the United States is on an unsustainable trajectory, particularly because the government has promised benefits to an expanding population of older Americans that will further outstrip tax revenue.

“It’s the type of thing that should keep people awake at night,” Janet L. Yellen, the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman, told a congressional committee last week.

But in Washington, in 2017, such warnings are no longer in vogue.",REAL
American Airlines Resolves Problem That Could Have Canceled Thousands of Flights,"Photo

Faced with the prospect of sweeping flight cancellations during the busy holiday season, American Airlines said Friday that it had resolved a scheduling problem that had left thousands of flights without assigned pilots.

“Customers can rest assured we will have the full schedule covered in December,” Matt Miller, a spokesman for American Airlines, said in a phone interview on Friday evening.

More than 10,000 flights were in danger of cancellation this week after a scheduling error allowed too many pilots to take time off during the high-volume travel days of late December.

But on Friday morning, the airline’s president, Robert Isom, met with Daniel F. Carey, the president of the Allied Pilots Association, and they agreed on a plan, said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the union, which represents American Airlines pilots. “So in record time, the situation was handled,” Mr. Tajer said.

Neither the airline nor the union would share details about the agreement or how much the pilots would be compensated for taking an unassigned shift. But both said more information would be made public soon, after the pilots themselves are fully briefed on the agreement.

Mr. Tajer said that while flights remained unassigned, the terms of Friday’s agreement were expected to attract enough pilots to cover the gap.",REAL
Republicans Near a Big Win — but Will It Lift Them Politically?,"“This is about doing what we promised the American people,” said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the head of the Republican Senate campaign organization that will play a major role in selling this tax plan to voters in advance of midterm elections next November.

Republican leaders did not see much alternative to meeting the final demands of uncommitted Republican senators since they were under immense pressure to get a win — any win. They hastily added provisions to appease Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana and offered assurances to Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona on immigration policy to guarantee their votes.

Democrats conceded that approval of the legislation — a sweeping bill that will cut corporate taxes and double the standard deduction — will prevent the first year of the Trump administration from being a legislative failure. But they believe that Republicans have made a political blunder because the reconfiguration of the tax structure — particularly new limits on the ability to deduct state and local taxes — will produce a tax increase for some voters who will be very unhappy when they realize it.

That could cost Republicans one of their bedrock principles. To appease party contributors demanding action on taxes, they may give up their mantle as the party of “no new taxes.”

“Today may be the first day of a new Republican Party — one that raises taxes on the middle class,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. “The one thing Republicans always promised the middle class is ‘we are not going to raise your taxes.’”

The tax debate came at a very unsettled time in Washington. As Republican lawmakers clustered on Friday behind closed doors in the Capitol in their final negotiations, Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, was at the federal courthouse just a short stretch down Constitution Avenue, pleading guilty to lying to the F.B.I. Accusations of sexual harassment are swirling around Capitol Hill. And lawmakers are still developing an endgame to finance the government after funding runs out next Friday.

Top Republicans were hoping that their success on the tax legislation after a difficult struggle would break through to the public and provide evidence to Americans that the Republican-controlled Congress could be effective. They say that the deep cuts in business taxes should spark an economic expansion that will benefit all Americans, though that argument has been disputed by economists and not reflected in past experience.

“This is a signature effort,” said Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, adding: “This is at least in our view the restoration of an American renaissance and economic opportunity, for kids, grandkids and everybody present.”

Party strategists note that the Senate tax bill also includes some other long-sought Republican goals such as opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to energy exploration and elimination of the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that most people have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.

“Considering the conventional wisdom that surrounded this Congress eight weeks ago, this is nothing short of a complete and total 180,” said Josh Holmes, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell who remains in close contact with him.

Democrats say that many voters already see the tax overhaul as heavily tilted toward the affluent, and they promise to drive that point home in the coming months.

“I am overwhelmingly hearing from people, what are the Republicans doing? Why are they pushing this big agenda that is going to put our country in trouble?” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a member of the Democratic leadership. “They all say it’s such a giveaway to the wealthy and are just really stunned that this is happening.”

Tax policy can be hard for voters to grasp, as former President Barack Obama learned early in his term. The economic recovery act that he signed into law in 2009 included a number of tax cuts; the biggest one was titled “Making Work Pay,” and it offered a tax credit of 6.2 percent of earned income, up to $400 for individuals and $800 for couples.

But Jason Furman, who advised Mr. Obama on economic policy and is now teaching at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the cut did not register in the American psyche.

“Our perception in the White House was that no one had any idea that we had cut their taxes,” he said.

Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, pointed to the strong Democratic showing — including a win in the governor’s race — in his state in November and said voters are going to be disappointed when they don’t see the benefits of the tax bill.

“In Virginia this past year, you had a Republican candidate that was running on a platform of tax cuts, and you had a Democratic candidate who was running on a platform of health care, and you saw the results,” Mr. Warner said.

But Republicans were frantic to do something big legislatively and a tax bill was the obvious policy area where they could come to agreement, even if it didn’t come very easily. The months ahead will determine whether the effort staved off a political debacle or contributed to one.",REAL
"In Ohio, a Tax Bill With Uncertain Payoffs Is Met With Ambivalence","Still, with midterm elections looming that will decide control of Congress, and both parties certain to try to define public opinion on the law, it is possible to get a sense of the debate to come in the barely formed reactions to the bill here. And the only thing clear is that, for now, voters are gripped by ambivalence and confusion that could yield unpredictable political results.

“Right now it’s tough for a citizen to get his arms around it with so much noise and vitriol,” said Daryl Revoldt, a North Canton City councilman. “When the dust settles it’s going to come down to two things: What does my 1040 look like and do I see economic improvement in my area?”

Stark County voted twice for Barack Obama, and some Democrats are eager to compete here by sounding populist themes. Many feel the law will be an albatross for Republicans.

Geoff Garin, a Democratic consultant advising groups on the tax debate, said his polling had found voters approximately twice as likely to say the Republican proposals favored the wealthy as to say they favored the middle class. Mr. Garin said he had detected no significant enthusiasm for slashing corporate tax rates.

“Voters believe that the wealthy are the primary beneficiaries of the bill, and very few voters expect that they, personally, will get much out of it,” Mr. Garin said. “The large majority of Americans don’t think that either the wealthy or big corporations pay their fair share in taxes, and the majority want both groups to pay more, not less.”

But voters here appeared hesitant to condemn the measure mainly because it helps the rich. Cutting the corporate tax rate might help bring jobs, they said. And many middle-class conservative voters are not as angry at income inequality as Democrats want them to be.

“The rich pay a hell of a lot of taxes in the country,” said Mac McLaughlin, 71, a retiree. “They are bad-mouthed, but I don’t think that’s right.”

But views were complicated. Many modest-income Republican voters said the use of loopholes by the rich violated a basic sense of fairness — almost as if they were stealing from the system.

“Lower taxes for the rich, is that what they’re talking about?” asked Al Brancifort, a machine tool retailer who voted for Mr. Trump, as he sipped coffee with friends at a Panera Bread. He still liked Mr. Trump, and did not know enough about the tax bill to say whether he liked it. But he was angry about loopholes used by the rich.

“I think everyone thinks taxes should be fairer,” he said. “The rich should pay their fair share.”

But that sentiment did not necessarily translate into thinking the rich should pay higher rates.

“I don’t think someone who makes more money should have to pay more in taxes,” said Samantha Reo, 18, a trainee at the National Beauty College. “My meal shouldn’t cost more just because I make more. That’s not fair.”

The greater sense of anxiety and anger about the tax overhaul among Republican voters appears to stem not from concerns about economic inequality, but rather about losing specific tax deductions. And Democrats say there may be room for them to exploit the issue in educated suburban areas, where more voters rely on write-offs for local taxes, mortgage interest and tuition benefits.

Mr. McLaughlin, a registered Republican, was worried about the college loan deductions for his grandson. He said he regretted voting for Mr. Trump, but not because of the tax bill. He doesn’t like his style, which he called abrasive, something that bothered him from the very beginning.

“I thought he’d get in there and get good people around him, but everybody around him seems to get fired,” he said.

For wavering independent voters, many of them high earners with college degrees, the bill would repeal a number of cherished tax deductions, imperiling Republican lawmakers in upscale suburban districts. If the bill would grant a degree of tax relief to many voters in places like Stark County in the short term, it does not include an eye-catching, imaginative component to persuade lower- and middle-income people that it would change their lives for the better.

Mr. Noble, the electrician, said he did not expect the tax bill to help his family. But more important than a modest tax cut, he said, was for the government to be helping to create living wage jobs and training programs and thinking about how profound changes in the economy, like automation, would affect working-class people.

“I have no jealousy for the wealthy,” he said. “It’s not right for me to be jealous of what they’ve got. What is right is to try to give everyone an even shake.”

Henry Olsen, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, described the bill as a “missed opportunity” for Republicans to show working-class voters that the party would champion their interests. He predicted Democrats would have an easier time demonizing the tax bill in 2018 than Republicans would have using it to stir voters.

“Some of them are going to see tax increases when they thought they were voting for tax cuts, and the ones who are going to see tax cuts are generally not going to see large ones,” Mr. Olsen said of Republican-leaning voters. “It’s very hard for me to see who’s going to be excited about it when they go to the polling booth.”",REAL
"Leon Cooper, Who Carried On a Battle for Tarawa, Dies at 98","“There was no way to get out of the line of fire,” Mr. Cooper said in “Return to Tarawa,” a documentary film about his battle experiences that was televised on the Military Channel in 2009. “Every goddamned angle was covered. We bumbled and stumbled into all this slaughter.”

The American forces took the island in 76 hours, but the toll was brutal: About 1,000 Marines died, and 2,296 were wounded. The New York Times wrote, “Riddled corpses form a ghastly fringe along the narrow white beaches where men of the Second Marine Division died for every foot of sand.”

Tarawa was the first of six Pacific battles, including Iwo Jima, that Mr. Cooper participated in. But it was the one that never left him.

Tarawa continued to anger him for years and caused nightmares; in one, he said, he dreamed he was falling deep underwater before encountering a young boy sitting on a submerged Sherman tank.

“You never really lose the memory of the sounds, the smells and everything, including the blood running down your nose so you’re smelling blood instead of breathing,” he told Armchair General magazine in 2009.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

His return to Tarawa for the documentary in 2008 brought back a flood of memories as he walked the beach where he had carried Marines into ferocious Japanese crossfire.

“I smell the stench of those bodies rotting in the sun,” he said. “It still comes back to me.”

Leon Cooper was born on Oct. 23, 1919, in Chicago. His father, William Sr., owned gas stations and was later a bookkeeper. His mother, the former Rachel Rossman, was a homemaker who became a saleswoman at Lane Bryant after ulcers made her husband too ill to continue working. To help his once-prosperous family make ends meet, Leon became a caddy and his brother William Jr. a prizefighter.

Mr. Cooper enlisted in the wartime Navy after graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in government, finance and accounting.

After the war, his family said, Mr. Cooper held federal and state government jobs, started a computer training school and was an executive at Teledyne and Litton Industries. He later helped invent a smoke detector tester and sold it for many years through his company, Home Safeguard Industries.

In the 1990s he began to write books, all but one about war. While researching “The War in the Pacific: A Retrospective” (2006), he learned that Red Beach on Betio, where he had delivered Marines, had become a dump, strewn with trash and in some places human excrement.

“Garbage lay everywhere on what to me was hallowed ground, where I saw so many of my countrymen killed or wounded by Japanese,” he said in the Armchair General interview.

Revisiting his past kindled Mr. Cooper’s late-in-life activism, which suited his gregarious, blunt-spoken and profane personality.

Disgusted by the conditions on the beach, he began contacting members of Congress to authorize funding to clean it up, a campaign that has not yet succeeded.

Steven Barber, the director of “Return to Tarawa,” said in an interview that Mr. Cooper had trouble persuading some members of Congress to take him seriously. In an attempt to lobby Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, he said, “Leon was beating on her door screaming, `Throw some alms to the poor!’ ”

But Representative Henry Waxman, another California Democrat, was more sympathetic. In remarks in 2006 in the Congressional Record praising Mr. Cooper, Mr. Waxman said, “The sanctity of our battlefield, monuments and veterans’ institutions is of utmost importance to preserve military history and pay respect to those who fought.”

Mr. Cooper made a stronger impact after “Return to Tarawa” was televised. It showed him, dismayed but relentless, walking the beach and spotting old gun emplacements and other artifacts of the battle; talking to local government officials of the Republic of Kiribati, of which Tarawa is part, and meeting people who had uncovered Marine remains.

“You look down in the ground,” he said in the film, “and you see the mortal remains of somebody — Japanese or American.”

Video

The broadcast led Representative Dan Lipinski, Democrat of Illinois, to draft language in the 2009 National Defense Authorization Act in the hope of persuading the Pentagon to make the return of Marines’ remains from Tarawa a higher priority.

In 2015, after 39 sets of remains were recovered, Mr. Cooper said the scope of his quest had expanded to all service members still missing in action in the Pacific Theater.

“More of our guys lie in unmarked graves in the Pacific than in Europe, where battles were in areas with urban populations,” he told the military newspaper Stars and Stripes.

In addition to his son William, he is survived by his daughters, Katie and Jeanie Cooper; two other sons, Peter and Lee; and six grandchildren. His wife, the former Alberta Brown, died in 1994.

Mr. Cooper believed that the Battle of Tarawa had been poorly planned and should never have been fought.

“Three days of savagery taught the Japanese how to kill more Americans,” he said in the documentary, “and taught us to do more stupid things.”",REAL

In San Francisco, an undocumented Mexican immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges in the killing of Kathryn Steinle, whose death was invoked by Mr. Trump as justification for his hard-line immigration agenda. After a five-week trial, the man was convicted only of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Ms. Steinle’s death on the city’s Pier 14, above, also fed a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status — the shooter had been deported five times — should be dealt with more aggressively.

Mr. Trump called the verdict “disgraceful,” and renewed his call to build a wall on the border with Mexico.

Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review:



“There’s less to the news than meets the eye.”

Mr. McCarthy does not believe that the news of General Michael T. Flynn’s guilty plea is a sign of a major breakthrough for the Russia investigation. If collusion did indeed occur between the Trump campaign and Russia, then Mr. Flynn would be “pleading guilty to an espionage conspiracy,” not what Mr. McCarthy describes as a “process crime” — lying to the F.B.I.

Bre Payton in The Federalist:

“Trump and his associates did contact foreign dignitaries before he took office. If that is a crime, Barack Obama is also guilty.”

Ms. Payton reacted to the news of Mr. Flynn’s guilty plea by listing past instances of American politicians meeting with foreign dignitaries before they were sworn into office. None of them, she points out, were prosecuted for any crimes. Read more »

Amy Davidson Sorkin in The New Yorker:



“That Mueller would treat Flynn as someone worth flipping, presumably in pursuit of a bigger case, is, to say the least, suggestive.”

Ms. Sorkin, unlike Mr. McCarthy, sees Friday’s news as the sign of “a new, significant chapter in the story of the magnetically charged interaction of Michael Flynn and Donald Trump.” Moreover, she writes, the larger issue at play in the relationship of Mr. Flynn and Mr. Trump is how “conspiratorialism was intertwined with real influence.” And extremism of that sort, she argues, can’t be solved with a special counsel.

Bob Dreyfuss in The Nation:

“Did Trump’s campaign collude with the Russians to subvert the US elections? The answer is still: We don’t know. There’s plenty of smoke, from multiple directions.”

Based on Mr. Flynn’s guilty plea, explains Mr. Dreyfuss, it would be premature to conclude that President Trump broke any law. However, Mr. Dreyfuss thinks the minimal charges against the president’s former national security adviser are a sign that Mr. Flynn is cooperating with Mr. Mueller and his team. He is, outside of Mr. Trump’s own family, one of the people who could do most damage to the president if he has flipped. Read more »",REAL
"Pasteles, a Puerto Rican Tradition, Have a Special Savor Now","Pastel-making is fraught with time-consuming tasks, the hardest being the making of the banana-and-plantain masa. Equally taxing is the layering of ingredients — masa; either meat, seafood or vegetables; and Spanish-style extras like olives, raisins or chickpeas — onto sheets of banana leaf and parchment paper. Those are all folded into rectangular little packages and tied up, two at a time, into a pair of pasteles that everyone calls “la junta.” (And before anyone can take a bite, each pastel must be boiled for an hour.)

“They are a pain in the balloons,” said Hernan Rodriguez, 52, who was born in Puerto Rico and has lived in New York City since 1987. His wife, the food writer Kathleen Squires, has written lovingly about his family’s holiday pastelada, or pastel-making party, in Puerto Rico. Mr. Rodriguez, who hosts a New York supper club called Chef’s Dinner Series, said many of his relatives attend with a drink in hand, “grating until they get bored.”

Photo

But this year, everyone must pitch in. The plan, Ms. Squires said, is to make as many pasteles as possible “from whatever we can find” at a cousin’s house near San Juan, then give them out to volunteer relief workers and hard-hit communities.

Even when you use a food processor to grate and purée the masa and freeze it in advance (wishful thinking for those without power in Puerto Rico), it’s still “a marathon,” said Angel Roman, 61, a deputy press secretary for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. In his spare time, he promotes the food, music and art of the Puerto Rican diaspora.

Mr. Roman, a second-generation Nuyorican, recently shot video of his sister-in-law Lucy Ramirez as she made pasteles, so as to pass what he fears are rapidly disappearing skills on to the family’s younger members. “Now people say, ‘I want pasteles,’ and they find these entrepreneurs,” Mr. Roman said. “People hand out cards, or they say, ‘Hey, call Doña Maria.’”

Photo

In New York, you could also find your pastel maker on Yelp — there’s Cater2u in the Bronx, Pasteles Cristina in Queens — or at groceries like the 76-year-old Moore Street Market in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where generations of Puerto Ricans have shopped for ajicito chiles, the saw-toothed herb called culantro and these days, pre-grated masa.

A handful of its vendors, like La Union, sell pasteles year-round, but during the holidays even the market’s religious-supply shop makes them to order. In the basement, Jesus Rodriguez works double-time building handmade machines from washing-machine motors that allow semiprofessional pastel makers to grate a box of bananas at a time. And across the street at the 49-year-old Anibal Meat Market, pastel makers like Maria Garcia stop in to buy chicken and pork for the filling.

Ms. Garcia, 70, charges $25 a dozen and has been selling pasteles for 35 years. She makes most of her sales through her son, who puts up a handwritten ad at his barbershop in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.

Photo

Most years, similar scenes would be playing out across Puerto Rico, said Melissa Fuster, 37, a professor of public health nutrition at Brooklyn College who is originally from San Juan, and often writes about Puerto Rican food culture.

Though many supermarkets on the island are still empty, she said, pasteles have long been improvised with what’s at hand, resulting in versions made with only yuca, without any filling, or with rice instead of masa.

“In difficult times, one thing that defines us is that we keep positive,” Ms. Fuster said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if people found a way to make pasteles.”

Photo

Suset Laboy Perez, 36, a Puerto Rican native who runs a Brooklyn public relations firm with her sister, Maria, worries less about pasteles this year than about the thousands of Puerto Ricans leaving the island, and the resulting losses to their culture.

Still, she said, she never made pasteles herself until years after she moved to the United States, holding her own pastel-making party as a way to connect with home.

“There will be more pasteladas,” Ms. Laboy Perez predicted. “We need them now more than ever.”

"Mitch Margo, an Original Member of the Tokens, Dies at 70","Photo

Mitch Margo, an original member of the Tokens, the singing group best known for their hit “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” died on Nov. 24 at his home in Studio City, Calif. He was 70.

His family announced his death in a statement but did not specify the cause.

Mr. Margo was only 13 in 1960 when he and his brother, Phil, joined the Linc-Tones, who soon renamed themselves the Tokens. “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” the group’s biggest hit, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in 1961 and one week in 1962.

Mr. Margo played piano in those early years, and over the years established himself as a multi-instrumentalist, also playing guitar, bass, drums and percussion.

The group wrote a number of its songs — Mr. Margo, his brother and the Tokens’ Hank Medress collaborated on the group’s first hit, “Tonight I Fell in Love” — but not “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” That song was based on a 1939 recording, “Mbube” — Zulu for “The Lion” — by the South African musician Solomon Linda and his group the Original Evening Birds.

Pete Seeger recorded a version in the 1950s as “Wimowe,” which is how he sang the original lyric “mbube” (pronounced EEM-boo-beh). The American songwriter George David Weiss reworked it in 1961, adding the lyrics “In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight.” That’s the version made famous by the Tokens.",REAL
The G.O.P. Tax Plan Can Be Confusing. Here’s Help Deciphering It.,"Photo

Not everyone would be getting tax relief, and some would get a tax increase. Choose your income group to see how you would be affected.

Be wary of descriptions of the tax plan’s effects that refer to a “typical” American family. This graphic shows the staggering diversity in circumstances of American taxpayers, and how each of their tax situations would be different.

Republicans dispute a report that the bill would raise taxes on the poor. The disagreement is related to a plan to remove the Obamacare requirement to purchase health insurance.

Photo

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the insurance mandate would result in nearly 13 million fewer people with insurance. If people choose to go without insurance, the government would no longer need to pay billions of dollars to subsidize their plans, and Republicans are counting on those savings to help pay for the tax cuts. But it’s not clear how much money would actually be saved.

Photo

The plan’s top objective appears to be giving corporations deep and lasting cuts. Central to the approach is the fundamental Republican belief that the cuts would translate to wage growth and jobs for Americans of all income levels.

President Trump has used several false claims and exaggerations as he has made his pitch. Here’s what he’s gotten wrong.

Mr. Trump said the typical American would see $4,000 more in wages from a corporate tax cut, but labor groups are concerned the money would go to executives and shareholders instead of workers.

Former N.S.A. Employee Pleads Guilty to Taking Classified Information,"Prosecutors said that from 2010 until March 2015, Mr. Pho began removing classified documents and writings. He kept those materials, some in digital form, at his home in Maryland, according to prosecutors.

It appears he was charged in March 2015.

Mr. Pho is one of three N.S.A. workers to be charged in the past two years with mishandling classified information, a dismal record for an agency that is responsible for some of the government’s most carefully guarded secrets.

The leaks have come to light as investigators scramble to trace the source of an even worse breach of N.S.A. security: the public release of the agency’s hacking tools by a still-unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. Some of those tools have been subsequently used for “ransomware” attacks that shut down or disrupted businesses, hospitals, railways and other enterprises around the world this year.

Government officials, who would speak of the classified details of the case only on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Pho took the classified documents home to help him rewrite his resume. But he had installed on his home computer antivirus software made by Kaspersky Lab, a top Russian software company, and Russian hackers are believed to have exploited the software to steal the documents, the officials said.

It is not clear whether anyone at Kaspersky Lab was aware of the document theft. The company has acknowledged finding N.S.A. hacking software on a customer’s computer and removing it, but says the material was subsequently destroyed. It has denied that it works with Russian intelligence.

The sensitivity of the case was evident on Friday, when one courtroom official described the charges against Mr. Pho as “super-sealed” before the hearing. The aggressive hacking of American targets by the Russian government, including the Democratic National Committee during last year’s election campaign, is a high-priority concern for the United States, and forensic information from Mr. Pho’s computer might provide useful clues.

In addition to Mr. Pho, an N.S.A. contractor, Harold T. Martin III, was arrested last year after F.B.I. agents found some 50 terabytes of data and documents that he had taken from the N.S.A. and other agencies over 20 years. The material was stuffed into a garden shed and car, among other places, and investigators have considered the possibility that the Shadow Brokers might have obtained the hacking tools from Mr. Martin, who had also worked at one point for agency’s Tailored Access Operations.

A contract linguist who worked for the N.S.A. in Georgia, Reality Winner, was arrested in June and charged with providing a single N.S.A. document to the online publication The Intercept. Both Mr. Martin and Ms. Winner are being held awaiting trial.",REAL
What Michael Flynn’s Guilty Plea Means in Mueller’s Russia Inquiry,"Talking sanctions with the Russian ambassador

False Statements Regarding FLYNN’s Request to the Russian Ambassador that Russia Refrain from Escalating the Situation in Response to U.S. Sanctions against Russia 3. On or about January 24, 2017, FLYNN agreed to be interviewed by agents from the FBI (“January 24 voluntary interview”). During the interview, FLYNN falsely stated that he did not ask Russia’s Ambassador to the United States (“Russian Ambassador”) to refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia. FLYNN also falsely stated that he did not remember a follow-up conversation in which the Russian Ambassador stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of FLYNN’s request.

Mr. Flynn has now admitted that he lied when he told the F.B.I. that he had not discussed sanctions with Sergey I. Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, during the transition period. In fact, as Mr. Flynn has now acknowledged, after outgoing President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Dec. 28 imposing the sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its election interference, Mr. Flynn — at the request of an unnamed transition official — asked Mr. Kislyak for Russia to consider reacting with restraint.

Their conversations about sanctions have been well documented, and helped catalyze the chain of events that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. On Dec. 30, for example, after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced that his country would not retaliate at that time for the sanctions, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart!” On Jan. 15, Vice President-elect Mike Pence publicly denied that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak.

But soon after the F.B.I. interview in which Mr. Flynn falsely said the same thing, Sally Q. Yates, an Obama-era holdover serving as acting attorney general, warned the Trump White House that Russia could blackmail Mr. Flynn over having lied. Mr. Trump soon fired Ms. Yates over an unrelated matter, but did not act against Mr. Flynn until The Washington Post reported nearly two weeks later that intelligence officials knew that Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador had talked about sanctions, leaving Mr. Kislyak with the impression that the Trump administration would revisit the issue after taking office. Mr. Trump then fired Mr. Flynn, ostensibly for having misled Mr. Pence.

Mr. Trump later pressured James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to go easy on Mr. Flynn, according to Mr. Comey, before eventually firing him over his handling of the Russia investigation — a step that led to the appointment of Mr. Mueller as special counsel.

Asking Russia to thwart U.S. policy at the U.N.

During the January 24 voluntary interview, FLYNN made additional false statements about calls he made to Russia and several other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations Security Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically FLYNN falsely stated that he only asked the countries’ positions on the vote, and that he did not request that any of the countries take any particular action on the resolution. FLYNN also falsely stated that the Russian Ambassador never described to him Russia’s response to FL YNN’s request regarding the resolution.

Mr. Flynn has also admitted lying to the F.B.I. about asking Russia and several other countries for help in thwarting an Obama administration foreign policy decision to permit the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israel for building settlements in Palestinian territory. Russia nevertheless declined to delay or veto the measure, which the Security Council passed despite lobbying by Israel and the objections from the Trump transition team.

Some commentators have raised the question of whether such efforts by Mr. Flynn and the Trump transition team to lobby foreign governments in ways that conflicted with the official policy of the United States under the Obama administration before they took power were a violation of the Logan Act. That is a 1799 law that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments. But this statute has raised constitutional concerns and is generally considered a dead letter, meaning it remains on the books but is defunct.

Where will Mueller go next?

On or about December 22, 2016, a very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team directed FLYNN to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, to learn where each government stood on the resolution and to influence those governments to delay the vote or defeat the resolution.

On or about December 29, 2016, FLYNN called a senior official of the Presidential Transition Team (“PTT official”), who was with other senior members of the Presidential Transition Team at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. Sanctions.

In trying to figure out what happened with Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr. Mueller appears to be following a strategy of starting at the fringes and moving inward, pressuring people to cooperate. Mr. Flynn may, of course, have already given information to Mr. Mueller’s team that is not mentioned in these court filings. But one question raised by the documents is who the unnamed people are with whom he spoke about these matters — and what those people told federal investigators.

For example, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and close adviser, reportedly took the lead for the transition team on the United Nations Security Council resolution about Israel. Earlier this month, Mr. Mueller’s investigators interviewed Mr. Kushner about Mr. Flynn’s interactions with the Russian ambassador.

"Taxpayers Paid $84,000 to End Sex Harassment Claim Against Texas Lawmaker","Mr. Farenthold’s statement Friday is sure to spark new calls to pass bipartisan legislation that would release the parties to Office of Compliance settlements from the mandatory nondisclosure agreements that come with them.

“While I 100 percent support more transparency with respect to claims against members of Congress, I can neither confirm nor deny that settlement involved my office as the Congressional Accountability Act prohibits me from answering that question,” Mr. Farenthold said.

Details of Mr. Farenthold’s relationship with Ms. Greene have been known for several years after Ms. Greene sued the lawmaker in 2014 alleging he had illegally fired her after she complained about mistreatment. Ms. Greene accused Mr. Farenthold and his chief of staff, Bob Haueter, of retaliating after she complained about a hostile work environment.

Besides harassment, Ms. Greene’s suit accused Mr. Farenthold of drinking “to excess” on numerous occasions and said that staff members who accompanied him to Capitol Hill functions were put on “redhead patrol” to keep him out of trouble.

Mr. Farenthold’s $84,000 is more than three times larger than the $27,000 settlement paid by Representative John Conyers Jr. to a former aide in 2015 out of his office funds, not the Office of Compliance. That settlement has yielded calls from both Ms. Pelosi and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, for the Michigan Democrat to resign.

Mr. Farenthold on Friday reissued a statement released by his office during the lawsuit that said the agreement between the two parties included “strict confidentiality.”

“Defendant disagrees strongly with the Plaintiff’s allegations in the Complaint, and Congressman Farenthold adamantly denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing. Plaintiff similarly disagrees with the Defendant’s allegations in the Answer,” the statement said. “However, after it became clear that further litigating this case would come at great expense to all involved — including the taxpayers — the parties engaged in mediation with a court-appointed mediator.”

The same year Ms. Greene sued him, Mr. Farenthold announced that he would give up a sexually explicit domain name — blow-me.org — that he had held since 1999, when he was in the business of buying such names on speculation and selling them.

The Office of Compliance said it has paid six settlements since 2013. The other cases include settlements for $150,000 for alleged veteran status discrimination, $76,000 for age discrimination, $37,250 for alleged disability discrimination, $7,000 for alleged discrimination because of sex and religion, and $5,200 for alleged discrimination claims because of race, national origin, and military service.

Did James Comey Subtweet Michael Flynn? Perhaps.,"Photo

Not long after the president’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I., the man who was leading the agency when the lie was told, James B. Comey, had something to tweet.

In what has become an occasional habit, Mr. Comey offered what appeared to be a quotation of relevance to the day’s unfolding news, in this case a biblical verse about justice.

The tweet appeared to quote the New American Standard Bible and included a link to the only post on Mr. Comey’s Instagram account. That post showed the quotation alongside a photo of a rushing river cutting across a craggy landscape, an image he has shared before on Twitter.

“I included the picture of the Great Falls of the Potomac because I like it and because it reminds me of my favorite scripture verse, from Amos,” he wrote at the time, including the same quotation he posted on Friday.
