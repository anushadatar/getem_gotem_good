"After Firing Matt Lauer, NBC Executives Move to Control the Damage","Mr. Oppenheim added that NBC executives began their questioning of Mr. Lauer after learning that reporters from The New York Times and Variety were looking into Mr. Lauer’s workplace conduct.

In a memo sent to NBC staff members on Friday afternoon, Mr. Lack addressed “the circumstances around Matt Lauer’s appalling behavior, why this was able to happen, and why it wasn’t reported sooner.”

Mr. Lack said that a “team of the most experienced NBCUniversal Legal and Human Resources leaders have begun a thorough and timely review of what happened” regarding Mr. Lauer. (When Fox News faced public allegations of sexual misconduct against its chairman, Roger Ailes, and one of its prime time stars, Bill O’Reilly, it hired the outside law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to conduct a review.)

Mr. Lack further pledged in the memo that the network would have “greater transparency” in the future. He also directed NBC News employees to take any complaints to their managers, newsroom leaders, human resources officers or two available hotlines, the NBCUniversal Integrity Helpline and the Comcast Listens Helpline.

On Wednesday, in the memo announcing Mr. Lauer’s firing, Mr. Lack said that the detailed allegation made against Mr. Lauer on Monday was “the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he’s been at NBC News.”

Later on Wednesday, NBC released a statement that seemed to emphasize the executives’ ignorance of any accusations against Mr. Lauer: “We can say unequivocally that prior to Monday night, current NBC News management was never made aware of any complaints about Matt Lauer’s conduct.”

Mr. Oppenheim’s visit to “NBC Nightly News” and Mr. Lack’s memo to the staff on Friday came after several news outlets, including The New York Post, reported that Mr. Lauer’s transgressions were well known at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

“Good Morning America,” the ABC program that is the main rival to “Today,” reported on Thursday that Mr. Lauer’s behavior was an “open secret” and that NBC’s official denial was at odds with ABC’s reporting on the matter.

Fox News, despite having parted with Mr. Ailes and Mr. O’Reilly after allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior against both men, has also been banging the drum against NBC executives and their handling of Mr. Lauer.

No news outlet, however, has specifically described how NBC’s executives were aware of Mr. Lauer’s allegations.

Mr. Lack became the NBC News chairman in 2015, and Mr. Oppenheim was named president of the news division this year. Both men have long histories with NBC and Mr. Lauer, who joined “Today” in 1994 and was named its co-anchor in 1997.

Mr. Lack served as the president of NBC News from 1993 to 2001 before becoming the president of the NBC network for two years. Mr. Oppenheim was a senior producer on “Today” from 2005 to 2008, and worked as the show’s the top executive from 2015 to early 2017. Between those stints, he worked in Hollywood, including as a screenwriter. He wrote the script for “Jackie,” a 2016 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis biopic starring Natalie Portman that earned three Oscar nominations.

“Today” continues to report on developments involving Mr. Lauer. On Friday morning, it aired a segment that included paparazzi shots of the former NBC star taken in the Hamptons after his firing and published by The Daily Mail on Thursday. The “Today” show report also noted that “questions have been raised about whether NBC executives knew of the complaints prior to Monday evening.”",REAL
Trump Took Office. Stocks Rose. Investors Are Still Worried.,"“The combination of potential interest rate shocks and a China implosion and the geopolitical situations with Russia, China, Iran, the Middle East, ISIS, and the difficult political situation in the U.S. with the most challenging, strangest presidential election we’ve had in our lifetime — it all adds up to many generic concerns,” he said at the time.

So how did the market rocket past expectations, and how should investors plan for 2018?

Mr. Trump is not unique among presidents for taking credit for a strong stock market and the broader economy. Most do it, if they can — just as surely as they try to skirt responsibility when there is a slump.

But the last 12 months of great returns lack the euphoria a person might expect after an increase in the Dow of nearly 30 percent.

Advisers say that is because many individual investors remain afraid that the eight-year bull market is going to collapse, while others struggle to separate Mr. Trump’s harsh political language from the strong fundamentals of American companies.

Individual investors are still seeking safe havens. One measure is bond funds, assets that help defend against a downturn. According to Yardeni Research, money continues to flow into bond funds.

“We’ve had a year of record-low volatility, strong returns and strong macroeconomic indicators,” said Michael O’Sullivan, chief investment officer for international wealth management at Credit Suisse. “But politically — we’re in a political recession. People have difficulty squaring the two.”

The firm’s global wealth report, released in November, showed that the world had grown wealthier in the last 12 months and not just at the top of the economic pyramid.

“The markets are focused very much on the business cycle, which is picking up,” Mr. O’Sullivan said. “That’s been a positive surprise, given how badly many people would have said the economy would have fared.”

In other words, the stock market is rising not because of Mr. Trump but in spite of him.

“Our view continues to be that politicians are not as important to investing as they would like investors to believe,” said Richard Bernstein, chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors, an investment advisory firm. “That’s always been our working model.”

Mr. Bernstein said corporate fundamentals remained strong. “Corporate profits remain healthy, liquidity remains abundant, and investors generally remain scared of stocks,” he said.

If presidential tweeting has not been driving the stock market, what should individual investors look for in equities? Analysts said investors should start by separating the political noise from the signals companies were sending out.

For one, any corporate tax cut is not necessarily a short-term gain for the stock market. Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer with Eaton Vance, said a tax cut could actually result in a short-term drop in stock prices. And the companies that have been driving the stock market’s growth, like health care and technology firms, will not benefit as much from a tax cut as smaller domestic companies that had not been able to take advantage of the loopholes and deductions under the current tax system.

Other analysts argue that the prospect of tax cuts ceased being a factor in this rally a few months into Mr. Trump’s presidency, when he and the Republican Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

“Corporate tax cuts are not priced into the market, because there is still skepticism toward the legislative process,” said John Lynch, chief investment strategist at LPL Financial.

For 2018, analysts are predicting that the stock market will continue to do well but with greater swings.

“I always love corporate profits,” Mr. Lynch said. “We can all get really geeky with these valuation measurements, but if you think about it, we have record profits growing slightly above historical rates. The Fed is tightening policy, and we’re still growing. That’s a pretty good recipe for equity investors.”

Anthony Roth, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust, said one difference in his strategy was a plan to use more active managers who pick stocks and to cut passively managed index funds. He said Wilmington Trust’s research showed that active managers were outperforming the market as a whole.

Or put another way: The skill that an active manager has is valuable in an environment when tweets about politics and people rattle less sophisticated investors.

Today, Mr. Sonnenfeldt said, he and the 580 members of Tiger 21, who have an average net worth of about $100 million, have nearly three-quarters of their money in private equity, real estate and publicly traded stocks.

Over the last year, he said, the group’s concern has not been with the political environment but with interest rates and wondering how long they will stay as low at they are. The group remains bullish on the advantages that American businesses have, like lower energy and transportation costs, over competitors in other countries.

So what could end the stock market’s run?

CTBC Bank USA put that question to affluent investors in California, New Jersey and New York, all blue states that would be affected by a loss of deductions for state and property taxes. The poll found that they remained confident about the economic and investment landscape, but that they feared a political threat like a conflict with North Korea or a large terrorist attack in the United States.

“The only thing we worry about is this geopolitical risk,” said Noor Menai, president and chief executive of CTBC Bank USA. “Nothing gets amplified. Markets take it in stride.”

Yet Mr. Menai said seasoned financial services professionals and institutional investors had a distinct advantage over individual investors.

“We’ve been through three crises over the past 25 years, and each time the market has reconstructed itself,” he said. “Over time, the insiders such as me have come to understand what the hype is versus what can happen.”

But individual investors do not have that knowledge. They still get scared about investing in a rising stock market because they fear it’s going to collapse. When that happens, said Judith Ward, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, she asks clients to focus on what they can control.

For example, if they are near retirement and cannot weather a 20 or 30 percent drop in their assets, she said, they should invest more conservatively.

“There is anxiety and uncertainty about the political climate, but my sense is people are looking at their personal situation and asking how is all of this going to impact them,” she said. And that, she said, can be summed up in one question: “How long can this bull market last?”

Want to Search Earnings for English Majors by College? You Can’t,"This week, however, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce proposed a half-measure: Release the data, but only on people who borrow money for their education, because they have already offered up personal financial information when applying for financial aid in the first place. The committee chairwoman, Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, has privacy concerns that keep her from signing on to the bipartisan proposals that would collect postgraduation data on everyone.

Supporters of full data transparency believe that this attempt at a compromise is not enough. Moreover, they do not believe the privacy concerns are real.

The history here is curious, and the New America Foundation, a policy research institute, recounted it in a paper called “College Blackout: How the Higher Education Lobby Fought to Keep Students in the Dark,” a title that probably conveys how the writers, Clare McCann and Amy Laitinen, feel about it.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The pair, who worked in the Department of Education during parts of President Barack Obama’s two terms, write that while President George W. Bush was in office, there was a strong push toward creating a student and graduate data reporting system. The big idea was to give the department a better sense of its own return on investment, given how much money it spends on higher education each year.

The odd thing about the resulting pushback, however, was the lack of unanimity among the higher education lobbying associations. The ones that represent community colleges and big public universities had no unsurmountable concerns with the proposals and support the senators’ efforts today. But one group that represents private schools, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, opposed the data collection and dissemination efforts.

This opposition reflected concerns about both privacy and security. There was an overarching feeling in higher education that student records were sacrosanct, and deserve protection from snooping politicians and others.

The security concerns were and are more specific: In an era when hackers regularly steal data from both government and private systems, why run the risk that millions of graduates’ incomes could end up in the hands of bad actors?

Advocates for more transparency don’t buy these arguments. After all, the data already exists in other places; the proposals on the table merely seek to connect what has already been collected and do so in a safe, secure, anonymous fashion.

“A lot of the history of man and technology has been about balancing risk,” said Tom Allison, acting director of policy and research at Young Invincibles, a student advocacy group. “When you started a fire to cook food, there was the danger that fire could hurt you. So I welcome this conversation, but let’s not just say ‘Privacy!’ and then stop it.”

One big mystery here is why private colleges would care more about privacy than public or community colleges. New America’s Ms. Laitinen dismisses the concern as a smoke screen by an organization whose members sometimes charge a lot more than their competitors.

“What they really wanted was institutional privacy rather than student privacy,” she said. “They don’t want families to have accurate, comparable data to make one of the most important decisions of their lives.”

Sarah A. Flanagan, vice president for government relations and policy development at the private college association, responded by noting that private colleges have the best outcomes when it comes to college completion. “Our schools have nothing to hide,” she said. “This is a question of at what point, and how, do we change privacy protections in order to take statistically valid information that we have to the next level.”

Answering that question will probably take at least a year of debate. Ms. Foxx’s proposed half-measure this week is just one part of a much larger conversation about dozens of proposed changes that would touch nearly every aspect of how the federal government pays for and regulates higher education.

Ms. Flanagan said her organization could live with the proposal that Ms. Foxx made this week. Ms. McCann of New America is not happy with it.

In my ideal world, every parent and potential student would be able to search program by program, school by school, to see who dropped out, who finished with how much debt, how much progress they were making on repaying the debt and how much the graduates from each program earned years later, on average. Full transparency.

An added bonus would be if we could refine the search to see how low-income Pell Grant recipients did in particular, or minorities. That way families who are themselves in those categories could see how others had done at particular schools.

The senators’ bipartisan proposals could get us there. Ms. Foxx’s idea would not, because it would measure outcomes only for people who borrowed money from the federal government. That would leave out about 30 percent of students, according to federal government figures.

“Unless you’re looking at a more comprehensive full set of data, how are you going to know if students from low-income backgrounds are faring worse than those from high-income backgrounds?” Ms. McCann said.

The outrage component here makes it easy to lose sight of more important concerns. Finishing college in the first place ought to be the primary concern, and it often makes sense to pay more to attend a school where students actually get their degrees and do so in a reasonable amount of time.

Moreover, salaries are not the only things that matter. We want our children to be happy, to find a good fit, to make lifelong friends and build a career network that helps sustain them. But getting a good job is always at or near the top of the list of results when Young Invincibles surveys its members about what they want out of college.

So rather than meekly paying whatever we are told, up to nearly $75,000 a year, all-in, at the most selective colleges, perhaps we ought to be a bit more greedy when demanding data, and more assertive about seeking demonstrated proof of value. Ask administrators for it, and press your elected federal representatives if you would like to see Ms. Foxx and her committee members help create a culture of deep data collection and wide dissemination in higher education.

“Why can’t they get with the 21st century?” asked Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. “What is wrong with giving that data out? They should think about what they would want their own children to have if they were looking at schools.”",REAL
Trump Throws a Holiday Party for the Press. Awk-ward.,"Trump Throws a Holiday Party for the Press. Awk-ward. Image Television cameras outside the press briefing room on Friday at the White House, which held its annual party for journalists in the afternoon. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times

WASHINGTON — The affair felt dissonant from the start: a festive gathering in the East Wing of the White House, thrown by President Trump for the journalists whose work and profession he lambastes on a near-daily basis.

The 2 p.m. start time did not sit well among some veterans in the White House press corps, either. As far back as they could remember, the reception had been held in the evening, complete with a presidential photo line, so that spouses and children could go home with a souvenir.

But like other Washington traditions that have been disrupted since the arrival of Mr. Trump, the White House holiday party still went ahead on Friday, if in slightly altered form.

CNN, Mr. Trump’s bête noire among media outlets, boycotted. Breitbart News, the right-wing website run by the former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon, received its first-ever invitation. Fox News personalities flooded the room, including the hosts of “Fox & Friends” and Sean Hannity, who attended the party for the first time in years.

Journalists who had fretted about whether to pose for a photograph with Mr. Trump — a ritual that can be awkward for reporters during any presidency — need not have worried: Mr. Trump skipped the usual photos.

And after addressing the throng for about two minutes, Mr. Trump declined to answer questions about his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I. about his ties to Russia. The president did find time to greet Maria Bartiromo, the Fox Business host, complimenting her on her ratings, according to three guests who witnessed the exchange.

April D. Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks and one of the few black reporters in the White House briefing room, did not attend. She said this week that she had not received an invitation, despite attending annually under previous administrations.

“It is what it is,” she said in an interview. “Everybody’s more upset than I am. I am O.K.” A White House official said the slight had been inadvertent.

Social events that bring together journalists and the powerful people they cover can lead to touchy questions about coziness — and Mr. Trump’s recent anti-press comments made the buildup to the reception particularly tense.

In the past week, Mr. Trump derided NBC as “fake news practitioners,” proposed a contest to determine which television network was “the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted” (with the winner to receive a “FAKE NEWS TROPHY”) and denounced CNN International, prompting Libyan and Egyptian officials to dispute the channel’s reporting.

“The photos of journalists blushing and chumming with the Obamas was cringe-worthy,” Tim Miller, who served as chief spokesman for Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, said before the affair. “Partying with a Trump administration that lies without shame and calls reporters the enemy of the people would just be pathetic.”

CNN declared that its employees would not attend Mr. Trump’s reception “in light of the president’s continued attacks on freedom of the press.”

But in the end, journalists from nearly every major television network and publication attended on Friday, including reporters for The New York Times. Some offered a form of muted protest: David Nakamura, a reporter for The Washington Post, wore a “First Amendment” lapel pin.

“With every administration, not just this administration, we are looking for opportunities to interact with folks in the White House,” said Christopher Isham, the Washington bureau chief for CBS News. “If you can do it in an environment that is a bit more social, a bit less formal, that’s probably not a bad thing.”

Friday’s reception (business attire requested) required guests and their plus-ones to pass through several security checkpoints. The White House was decorated with Christmas trees decked in fake snow and giant red bows, and a distinct aroma of pine greeted attendees who passed through a colonnade lined with white branches, a décor overseen by the first lady, Melania Trump.

Eggnog — boozy and virgin varieties — was served. In a nod to Hanukkah, there were also miniature potato latkes. The official White House holiday card, however, declared “Merry Christmas,” in contrast to the nondenominational versions sent by the Obamas.

“I’m bringing my wife, because she puts up with 24/7 news cycles, so I look forward to treating her to an afternoon out,” said Charlie Spiering, Breitbart’s senior White House correspondent. He added that Breitbart writers had not been invited to the reception during the Obama administration. (Other right-wing news outlets like Newsmax also received invitations.)

Among the guests spotted entering the White House: Bill Shine, a former co-president of Fox News, who was briefly considered for a position in the administration; the “CBS This Morning” host Norah O’Donnell; and the anchor Greta Van Susteren. In a break from past years, the White House press office also invited network camera crews and technicians who work in the West Wing.

Like the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, the president’s holiday reception has faced occasional criticism over the years. But the Trump presidency has placed long-accepted Washington folkways under a national microscope, and critics on the right and the left seize on any twitch or tweet by White House reporters that could suggest anti-Trump bias or pro-Trump sycophancy.

“I have to say I’m conflicted about it,” Sally Quinn, an arbiter of Washington’s social mores, said in an interview. “My feeling is, if you’re a journalist and you cover the White House, it is probably a good idea to go.”

She added: “There are these moments of civility, and I think that any moment of civility should be encouraged.”

Brian Karem, a correspondent for the Sentinel newspapers in Maryland, who frequently clashes with White House officials at briefings, did not receive an invitation. “I wear it as a badge of honor,” he said of the snub.

Even so, he allowed that the event did carry a certain allure. “If you haven’t gone before, you want to go at least once,” Mr. Karem said. “It is the White House.”

American Airlines’ New Rule on Smart Bags: Battery Must Be Removable,"Photo

Luggage that can help you navigate the airport or even let you know where it is if it did not follow you to your destination is the biggest innovation in baggage since wheels. But soon, it may not be welcome in airline cargo holds.

American Airlines said on Friday that it would not allow passengers to check smart luggage unless they first remove the batteries that fuel the high-tech features. According to Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for the airline, the new rule, which takes effect on Jan. 15, comes as powered luggage is getting more popular.

“We’ve looked at the prevalence of these bags as they most likely are going to be a hot item, no pun intended, this holiday season,” he said. “We have nothing against a smart bag, we understand customers like them,” but the airline also has to make sure they are safe to transport.

The bags themselves are not an issue, but the lithium ion batteries that power them have caused problems in the sky. In 2010, a United Parcel Service 747 plane was carrying tens of thousands of the batteries to Cologne, Germany, from Dubai when one battery ignited, causing a destructive chain reaction that brought down the jet. When Boeing was rolling out its 787 Dreamliners in 2013, a problem with the lithium ion batteries that powered some onboard equipment grounded the fleet in its first months of service. Boeing eventually redesigned the batteries and their housing.

Federal Aviation Administration guidelines already bar passengers from packing spare lithium ion batteries in their checked baggage, and strongly suggest that travelers keep any devices with the batteries in their carry-on bags. That way, any smoke or fire from the batteries could be quickly detected. In the cargo hold, a fire may not be noticed by the automatic suppression system until it has already become a critical problem.

American Airlines, so far, is the only United States carrier to announce this kind of restriction.

Mr. Feinstein said American Airlines crews were trained to deal with fires in the cabin, but there was much less they could do to extinguish flames in the baggage compartment. For that reason, American Airlines will only allow smart luggage onboard if the battery can be disconnected. The carrier will not require travelers to take out the battery if they are bringing the bag into the cabin. But they must be able to check the bag if there is not enough space in the overhead bin.

China’s Next Potential Boom Spot: The Places People Overlook,"In the prefecture that contains Liangduo, Yancheng, locals’ wallets are fattening more quickly than the national rate, and their household spending — which surged 8 percent per person in 2016 — outpaced the rises in Beijing and Shanghai.

Signs of that new prosperity can be seen at Auto City, a jumble of ramshackle, boxy buildings in Yancheng where Toyota, Ford and just about every other major brand compete for customers. Zhou Zhengguo, owner of a dealership for the Chinese automaker Geely, expects to sell 2,000 cars this year, four times more than just two years ago.

“Most people who bought cars were private businessmen,” Mr. Zhou said. “Now working-class people buy, too.”

Those who live in China’s less developed places could be crucial to the next stage of China’s development.

Robin Xing, an economist at Morgan Stanley, believes consumer spending in places like Yancheng’s urban center will continue to outperform bigger cities. As a result, two-thirds of all additional private consumption growth will come from these less developed areas through 2030.

“We do expect them to catch up, to narrow the income gap with the large cities,” Mr. Xing said.

Businesses are looking at such areas in a new light. New highways and high-speed railways make relocating factories and other operations into smaller cities easier, allowing companies to take advantage of their lower costs. Industrial output in Yancheng expanded more quickly than the national rate last year.

The gains are not limited to the hinterland’s main towns. Farms are becoming bigger, more efficient and more lucrative.

In Xinling, a nearby village, Luo Jianhai, 37, is typical of a new breed of farmer-entrepreneur. He has steadily expanded the farm where he tills rice and wheat by renting land from his neighbors. He also invested in two new tractors, which he lends out to other farmers who need them to work their own larger plots. Over the past three years his annual income has increased seven times, to $100,000, and his spending has quadrupled, mainly on higher-quality clothing for his three children and a new, $17,000 car from a General Motors joint venture.

His improved lifestyle, Mr. Luo said, “is the difference between being poor and having money.”

Nearby, Cheng Zhiguo, 47, also enlarged his farm this year, increasing his net income to about $23,000 — five times greater than just three years ago. His reward: his first car, a Hyundai, bought in August.

Such change is luring urban entrepreneurs such as Zhou Jian. Mr. Zhou, a 33-year-old resident of Nanjing, a major city in eastern China, figured that large-scale farming would also need more money. In 2013, he founded Nongfenqi E-Commerce Company, which helps arrange loans for farming families from banks and other lenders.

Nongfenqi has since arranged about $150 million in loans, opened more than 100 offices spread around rural China and hired 800 employees. “The upgrading of the market allows businesses like us to serve these big farmers,” Mr. Zhou said.

Vice Media Fires 3 Employees After Harassment Complaints,"Mr. Mojica confirmed in an email that he had been fired and said that he was “deeply disappointed by this outcome.”

Vice, which is based in Brooklyn, began in Canada 23 years ago as a free punk magazine and retained much of its brazen attitude as it evolved into a corporate behemoth with a presence in film production, publishing, music, cable television and more.

Minority owners of Vice include 21st Century Fox and the Walt Disney Company. With the documentary series “Vice News Tonight,” it is also a prominent part of HBO, a Time Warner property.

The company has recently faced questions about its corporate culture. An article by The Daily Beast last month cited complaints from various Vice employees about pervasive sexual harassment in the workplace that were said to be largely ignored by management.

Phoebe Barghouty, a former associate producer at Vice, told The Daily Beast that she repeatedly experienced sexually inappropriate behavior from a Vice bureau chief who is no longer with the company. She said that Mr. Mojica, then editor in chief of ViceNews.com, brushed off her concerns.

Vice later put Mr. Mojica on leave.

Mr. Mojica said on Friday that, far from being indifferent to his employee’s discomfort, he “immediately elevated the concerns to H.R. upon being made aware of them.”

“You’ll never hear me suggest I was a perfect editor in chief during my time in that role, but in the situation in question I had done the right thing,” he said, adding, “I do not believe — and never suggested — that such behavior should be tolerated.”

Ms. Tohyama, who helped lead the National Basketball Association’s human resources team for several years, wrote on Thursday that Vice had a “zero tolerance policy” toward inappropriate behavior. “In light of the need for speed and efficiency,” she added, the company turned to outside investigators to look into the complaints.

Vice is the latest media organization to terminate employees over allegations of harassment. In the weeks since accusations of sexual assault against the entertainment magnate Harvey Weinstein were made public, similar complaints have caused prominent media figures such as the political journalist Mark Halperin, Matt Lauer of NBC’s “Today” show, the CBS and PBS anchor Charlie Rose and others to lose their jobs.

Vice said in a memo accompanying Ms. Tohyama’s that, as the company evolved, its “workplace culture has fallen short.” The company pledged to seek pay parity for its male and female employees by the end of 2018 and said that it had started sensitivity training, updated the reporting process for inappropriate behavior and reshuffled and diversified its board.

Soon after the Daily Beast report was published, Vice announced an advisory board to review corporate policies. Members include Gloria Steinem, whose “Woman” documentary series for Vice was nominated for an Emmy last year; Tina Tchen, who was Michelle Obama’s chief of staff; and Maya Harris, a senior policy adviser for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.",REAL
"If You’re 70½, It’s Time to Take Money From Your Retirement Account","As of early November, however, Fidelity reported that about half of its 970,000 I.R.A. customers hadn’t made any required withdrawals for 2017, while an additional 12 percent had taken a partial withdrawal.

Some people may have trouble adjusting to the idea of taking money out of retirement accounts after decades of putting cash into them, Ms. Cassidy said. Or it may be that because the stock market has been doing well, people are more reluctant than usual about taking money out of equities.

Whatever the reason, neglecting to make the withdrawal on time can be costly, said Frank Fiumecaldo, a financial planner and director of client services at wealth manager R. W. Rogé & Company in Bohemia, N.Y. You may face a penalty of 50 percent of the money you didn’t withdraw. If, for instance, you were required to take out $3,000 but didn’t, you could owe a penalty of $1,500. It’s possible to have the penalty waived by filing a form with the I.R.S. and offering a reasonable explanation, he said. But why risk it?

This year, it’s more important than usual not to procrastinate, Ms. Cassidy noted, because Dec. 31 falls on a weekend, meaning the last day to take an annual required minimum distribution, or R.M.D., for 2017 is a bit earlier, on Dec. 29.

If you don’t need the money right away for living expenses, you can invest it in a taxable account. Or you can donate it to charity. As long as the money — up to $100,000 — goes directly to the charitable organization, you’ll avoid paying income taxes on it (although you can’t claim a tax deduction for the gift), Ms. Cassidy said.

Clients who depend on their R.M.D.s to meet regular living expenses often ask to have the funds dispensed monthly, Mr. Fiumecaldo said.

Here are some questions and answers about required minimum distributions:

Is the deadline for R.M.D.s always at the end of year?

You must make an initial withdrawal by April 1 of the year after you turned 70½. Then, after the first distribution, the annual deadline switches to Dec. 31. So if you turned 70½ in 2017 (meaning, you were born between July 1, 1946, and June 30, 1947, Ms. Cassidy said), you can wait another three months to make an initial withdrawal.

But be aware that there’s a potential downside to waiting, depending on your specific financial situation, Mr. Milove said. If you delay your first withdrawal to early 2018, you won’t have to worry about paying a penalty. But you’ll have to take another annual distribution — for 2018 — by the end of the year. Taking two withdrawals in one year will increase your taxable income.

“You could push yourself into a higher tax bracket,” Mr. Milove said.

On the other hand, say you worked during part of the year you turned 70½. Adding an R.M.D. to the income from your job might also push you into a higher tax bracket. So it might be better to wait and take two distributions the next year.

“There are times when it makes sense,” Mr. Fiumecaldo said. It’s helpful to consult with a tax adviser or financial planner, he said, to see what works best for you.

How do I know how much I am required to withdraw?

The minimum amount is based on a formula that factors in your account balance and your life expectancy, using an I.R.S. table. Most investment companies calculate the amount for their customers, and usually offer the option of having the correct amount automatically transferred to an account of your choosing on a specified date. If you prefer to do the math yourself, Vanguard offers an online calculator. Or you can check out I.R.S. Publication 590B.

What if I have more than one I.R.A.?

You must calculate the minimum withdrawal for each account, but you can withdraw the total from a single I.R.A., if you prefer. That option isn’t available for 401(k)’s. If you have more than one, you generally must take distributions from each account separately, Mr. Milove said.",REAL
Trump’s First Major Trade Fight With China Could Be Over Solar Panels,"But American manufacturers say the cheap panels have been unfairly financed by the Chinese government. Chinese manufacturers have benefited from cheap loans from government-run banks. Even some Chinese companies that have struggled with losses and had trouble making loan payments have been able to stay afloat.

Such manufacturers in China “are technically insolvent, but they still get capital,” said Mark Widmar, the chief executive of First Solar, a large manufacturer based in Phoenix.

The United States has already imposed tariffs on solar panels from China over the past five years, prompting Chinese manufacturers to build vast factories in Southeast Asia. Now, the Trump administration has indicated it may raise the stakes by authorizing tariffs on all solar panel imports, including those from Southeast Asia.

Administration officials have so far allowed two solar panel companies with factories in the United States to ask Washington for tariffs on all solar panel imports.

Video

Thanks to a complicated series of maneuvers within the United States system for evaluating trade cases, the Trump administration now has a Jan. 26 deadline to grant the companies’ requests for wider tariffs.

China opposes the move, which it argues would hurt solar panel buyers. When the Chinese-owned factories in Southeast Asia are included, Chinese panel makers account for about four-fifths of global sales.

Solar panel installers, developers of utility-scale solar panel power generation projects and others connected to the industry also oppose broader tariffs. The Solar Energy Industries Association, which represents those groups, contends that the tariffs would destroy more installation jobs than they would protect or create among manufacturers.

“If my price goes up, I’m not going to win” orders, Abigail Ross Hopper, the chief executive and president of the Washington-based association, said in a telephone interview.

Yet the effects of tariffs are disputed within the industry. Solar panel makers in the United States say higher tariffs would add only modestly to the cost of projects.

“That’s still very compelling for any utility,” said Mr. Widmar, of First Solar.

Many trade experts predict the United States will impose tariffs on all solar panel imports, because Mr. Trump has expressed sympathy for industrial workers in the United States and for fossil fuels, while voicing skepticism about the use of renewable energy.

If the Trump administration decides to impose more tariffs next month, it could be the first blow in a one-two punch to China on trade, making it even more likely that Beijing might retaliate against American exports. The deadline for the administration to act on possibly imposing tariffs on washing machines from around the world, and particularly from China, comes a little more than a week later, on Feb. 3.

Mr. Li, the Chinese economic adviser, contended that China, not the United States, was the country that had proved willing to let market forces determine winners and losers in the solar panel market. China had 800 solar panel companies a decade ago and now has just 70 or 80, after allowing the rest to become insolvent. Yet China’s solar panel production has more than quintupled in the past decade because, he said, Beijing has allowed market forces to winnow the industry to the most efficient competitors.

By contrast, political support in the United States for solar panel manufacturing wilted after a single solar equipment company in California, Solyndra, collapsed in 2011 after obtaining $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees.

“You are a little bit worried by Solyndra; very small companies, why are you worried about them?” Mr. Li said. “Then you hurt all the users.”",REAL
Dueling Tax Plans: Here’s What the Senate and House Have to Resolve,"The Senate plan eliminates the so-called SALT deduction entirely, which could anger many upper-middle-class families and spook House members who have already objected to the more generous scaled-back version in their chamber.

But the Senate may well add that House property tax provision into its bill to satisfy Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has said that it must be done before she commits to the bill. By the end of the day, the Senate may add in the $10,000 property tax deduction, which would go a long way to assuaging House lawmakers as well.

Mortgage interest deduction

Republicans in the House would cap the deduction for mortgage interest debt at $500,000, down from the current cap of $1 million.

Senate Republicans have decided to leave the deduction alone. If that holds, it would be a big victory for real estate lobbyists, who have been vocal in their opposition to changing the deduction, but that could make the House bill even more expensive.

Cutting the corporate tax rate

Reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, from 35 percent, is at the center of both the House and the Senate tax plans. How soon they get there is the only difference. The House bill immediately cuts the corporate tax rate, fulfilling the wishes of President Trump.

The Senate imposes a one-year delay on lowering the rate, a move that allows Senate Republicans to preserve other deductions that the House eliminates. Economists have debated the effect that the delay will have on economic growth.

View all New York Times newsletters.

Now, the Senate is discussing whether to raise the rate above that 20 percent figure to help pay for other provisions or, possibly, to help defray the budget costs of the bill. Increasing the corporate tax rate would be a troublesome development for many Republicans and Mr. Trump, who have drawn a red line on a 20 percent corporate rate.

Small-business treatment

Republicans are united in their desire to give small businesses a tax break, but their plans differ in how to provide a tax cut. House lawmakers created a new 25 percent tax for so-called pass-through businesses — sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners. However, they erected guardrails to prevent the new rate from becoming a loophole that wealthy individuals can exploit by converting themselves into entities to take advantage of the 25 percent rate.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The Senate takes a different approach, creating a new deduction for pass-through businesses along with other incentives to promote investment. To satisfy the concerns of certain senators, including Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, the deduction is expected to be increased to 23 percent from the current 17.4 percent in the bill.

Making the tax code more ‘America First’

A main priority of the Republican tax effort has been making the United States’ tax system more competitive so that companies invest here and so that they do not have an incentive to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. The Senate plan will impose taxes on American and foreign companies that shift offshore money earned in the United States. There would be an effective minimum tax on money earned domestically and a 12.5 percent tax on foreign revenue from intellectual property.

The original House approach would have levied a 20 percent “excise tax” on payments between American and foreign companies that are affiliated with each other. This idea set off substantial confusion and opposition from drug and insurance lobbyists and was tweaked during the Ways and Means Committee’s amendment process.

Adoption, education, health

To cut business and individual tax rates and double the standard deduction for individuals and families, Republicans had to do away with many popular tax credits and other prized deductions. The House initially eliminated a tax credit for adoptions but later restored it. The House repealed deductions for medical expenses and counted tuition wavers that are widely used by graduate students as taxable income.

In the Senate, Republicans also preserve the adoption tax credit. Unlike the House, they maintain the deduction for medical expenses and provide “education relief” for graduate students.

To repeal, or not to repeal, the estate tax

Almost all Republicans agree philosophically that the estate tax — or, as they call it, the death tax — is unfair. But repealing it is costly, and the tax tends to hit only the very wealthy (and their heirs). House Republicans decided in their bill to double the amount of inherited wealth that is exempt from the tax to $11 million, from $5.5 million, and phase out the tax after six years. In a late amendment, they moved to delay its full repeal another year, to 2025.

In the Senate, the exemption is also doubled, but the death tax never dies.",REAL
DealBook Briefing: Wall Street’s Fear Gauge Jumps on Flynn News,"Remember that the VIX tracks investor expectations of how volatile stock markets will be in the month ahead. The possibility that Mr. Flynn could implicate senior White House officials in Mr. Mueller’s investigation would certainly throw the markets into high uncertainty.

Major stock indexes have pulled back today as well, despite the tax news. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index was down nearly 1 percent at 2,622.12, while the Dow Jones industrial average was down a more modest 0.6 percent, at 24,120.72.

More potential holdouts back the Senate tax plan.

Two Republican senators who had previously opposed the bill for its treatment of so-called pass-through businesses, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Steve Daines of Montana, now say they will vote for the legislation.

What convinced them? Tweaks to how pass-through businesses are treated:

The Senate tax bill allows pass-through owners to deduct 17.4 percent of their business income as a way of lowering their taxes. Republicans were planning to increase the deduction to 20 percent to address the concerns over how pass-through owners were being treated by the bill. Now, the deduction is to be raised to 23 percent, an aide to Mr. Daines said.

The remaining holdouts include Susan Collins of Maine and several senators concerned about the bill’s effect on the deficit.

The issues that still need to be addressed in the Senate bill.

Senators are still expected to vote today on the proposal. But its chances of succeeding may come down to whether deficit hawks in the Senate like Bob Corker of Tennessee can be convinced that the overhaul will not add to the national deficit. Last night, lawmakers were pushed to remove a provision that would have automatically raised tax rates if economic growth did not prove strong enough to pay for cuts.

That’s on top of other bad news for Senate Republicans, including the Joint Committee on Taxation finding that the bill would add $1 trillion to the deficit, though G.O.P. officials largely dismissed that conclusion. Here’s a handy breakdown of various analyses of the bill’s potential effect on the deficit.

How Republican leaders are proposing to find at least $400 billion in new revenue

• Slowly raising corporate rates above 20 percent

• Huge automatic cuts to government programs, from Medicare to farm subsidies to student loans

The big problem

According to Caitlin Owens of Axios:

Aides say they still hope to bring all 52 Republicans to yes. But it’s going to be extremely hard to find ways to raise as much as $500 billion in revenue overnight, and raising taxes could lose other members.

Robert Mercer has financial ties to Project Veritas.

A family investment vehicle tied to the billionaire helped finance Project Veritas, a conservative activist organization, according to tax filings obtained by BuzzFeed.

From the article:

Gravitas Maximus LLC — a Mercer investment vehicle through which he also funded the conservative outlet Breitbart — gave $25,000 to Project Veritas, according to a nonpublic portion of a 2012 tax form. The family’s involvement has not previously been made public.

Project Veritas popped up in the news this week when the WaPo reported that the organization tried to convince some of its reporters to write about false claims involving the Alabama Republican senate candidate Roy Moore.

Mr. Mercer stepped down in November as co-chief executive of Renaissance Technologies amid signs of unease among the firm’s clients over his embrace of polarizing political figures.

He has tried to distance himself from Breitbart’s executive chairman, Steve Bannon, by selling his investment in Breitbart to his daughters. But people with knowledge of his thinking previously told the NYT that that he was likely to accelerate his political donations.

A key figure from ‘Barbarians at the Gate’ is taking a step back.

Peter Cohen, a longtime financier, will step down as the financial firm’s C.E.O. He will remain chairman, but leading the firm on a day-to-day basis will be Jeffrey Solomon.

Mr. Cohen has had a long career in banking, one whose highlights include a starring role in the famed fight over RJR Nabisco. It was Mr. Cohen — then the head of Shearson Lehman Hutton — who, along with his colleague Tom Hill, provided the financial backing for F. Ross Johnson’s attempted leveraged buyout of the company. Of course, he and Mr. Johnson were eventually defeated by KKR.

The banker later founded Ramius Capital, a hedge fund, in 1994 and later merged it with the much older Cowen in 2009 to become a firm whose offerings run from investment banking to asset management.

Mr. Cohen said in a statement:

“The new year will mark my 50th anniversary in the industry and will also be Cowen’s 100th year anniversary. We have transformed Cowen over the last eight years, through a series of acquisitions and organic initiatives, into an organization that has a solid foundation with tremendous growth opportunities.”

Are stock investors still confident on a tax overhaul?

The Dow Jones industrial average smashed through 24,000 on Thursday, largely on increased optimism that the Senate would pass its tax bill. The Dow has had 63 record closes this year, and it has crossed five one-thousand-point markers this year, the most ever.

But today is a new day. Futures in both the Dow and the S.&P. 500 were down in premarket trading.

Why investors shouldn’t be so optimistic on taxes: Lower corporate tax bills might not bolster the earnings of big companies that much. “The effective tax rate among S.&P. 500 companies is already 26 percent. A 20 percent corporate tax rate would help, but it would not be as big a boon to large companies as it would be to small companies,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, told CNBC.

If the Senate tax bill fails …

“If the tax reform doesn’t get done, I think there will be a pretty sharp correction,” said Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, one of the largest banking companies in the northeastern United States.

Mr. Van Saun told the NYT that stock markets could plunge as much as 15 percent if the tax cut were to be derailed in Congress.

The Great American Single-Family Home Problem,"Even with a flurry of legislation, economists are skeptical that California can dent home prices anytime soon. Housing takes years to build. And five of the new housing bills included a union-backed measure that requires developers to pay prevailing wages on certain projects, something that critics say will increase the cost of construction.

But the bigger, thornier question is where all these new residences will go, and how hard neighbors will try to prevent them. The Haskell Street fight shows why passing laws is one thing and building is another, but also gives a glimpse of what the denser neighborhoods of the future might look like — and why lots of little buildings are more important than a few skyscrapers.

Kurt’s Tomatoes

The 1300 block of Haskell Street sits in a kind of transition zone between the taller buildings in downtown Berkeley and the low-rise homes scattered through the eastern hills. The neighborhood has a number of single-family homes, and the street is quiet and quasi-suburban, but there are also apartment buildings and backyard cottages that nod to the city’s denser core.

A little under three years ago, a contractor named Christian Szilagy bought the property and presented the city with a proposal to demolish the house and replace it with three skinny and rectangular homes that would extend through the lot. Each would have one parking spot, a garden and about 1,500 square feet of living space.

The neighbors hated it. The public discussion began when Matthew Baran, the project architect, convened a meeting with 20 or so neighbors in the home’s backyard. A mediator joined him and later filed a three-sentence report to the city: “The applicant described the project. Not a single neighbor had anything positive to say about it. No further meetings were scheduled.”

Not in My Backyard In Berkeley, a proposal to demolish a single-family residence and replace it with three smaller units has met with disapproval from neighborhood residents. How the proposed three-unit project would sit on the 50-by-150-foot Haskell Street lot, compared with the existing house and garage: EXISTING STRUCTURES PROPOSED STRUCTURES 50 FT. 50 FT. Building 1 Garage Building 2 150 FT. 150 FT. Residence Building 3 Drive EXISTING STRUCTURES 150 FT. Drive Garage Residence 50 FT. PROPOSED STRUCTURES 150 FT. 50 FT. Building 2 Building 1 Building 3

On paper, at least, there was nothing wrong with the proposal. The city’s zoning code designates the area as “R2-A,” or a mixed-density area with apartments as well as houses.

Berkeley’s planning staff recommended approval. But as neighbors wrote letters, called the city and showed up at meetings holding signs that said “Protect Our Community” and “Reject 1310 Haskell Permit!,” the project quickly became politicized.

One focal point was Kurt Caudle’s garden. Mr. Caudle is a brewpub manager who lives in a small house on the back side of Ms. Trew’s property (that lot has two homes, or one fewer than was proposed next door). Just outside his back door sits an oasis from the city: a quiet garden where he has a small Buddha statue and grows tomatoes, squash and greens in raised beds that he built.

In letters and at city meetings, Mr. Caudle complained that the homes would obstruct sunlight and imperil the garden “on which I and my neighbors depend for food.” Sophie Hahn, a member of the city’s Zoning Adjustments Board who now sits on the City Council, was sympathetic.

“When you completely shadow all of the open space,” Ms. Hahn said during a hearing, “you really impact the ability for anybody to possibly grow food in this community.”

The debate was easy to caricature, a textbook example of what housing advocates are talking about when they decry the not-in-my-backyard, or Nimby, attitude. Reality is more nuanced. As cities become magnets for high-paying jobs and corporate headquarters, there has been a backlash of anti-development sentiment and a push for protections like rent control.

Home prices in the ZIP code surrounding the 1300 block of Haskell Street have just about doubled over the past five years, to an average of about $900,000, according to Zillow. Those numbers are terrifying to people like L.C. Stephens, 67, who is retired from the state corrections department.

Mr. Stephens pays $1,600 to live in a modest apartment complex that was built in 1963 and sits just a few lots down from the project site. His building was recently purchased by investors and is being painted and renovated. The rehabilitated units go for $2,400 and up.

“People are getting priced out,” he said. “It’s not about ‘We need more housing.’ Yeah, we can use it, but it needs to be affordable.”

Photo

The proposed homes are not that. They are estimated to sell for around $1 million. But this is an illustration of the economist’s argument that more housing will lower prices. The cost of a rehabilitated single-family home in the area — which is what many of the neighbors preferred to see on the lot — runs to $1.4 million or more.

Even so, economics is not politics. The argument that quiet, low-slung neighborhoods have to change to keep everyone from being priced out is never going to be a political winner. When the Haskell Street proposal came up for a vote, Jesse Arreguin, who was then a city councilman but is now the mayor of Berkeley, gave a “no” vote that sounded like a campaign speech.

“This issue is bigger than Haskell Street,” Mr. Arreguin said. “This project sets a precedent for what I believe is out-of-scale development that will compromise the quality of life and character of our neighborhoods throughout the city of Berkeley.”

Making It Easier to Sue

Not-in-my-backyard activism has been a fixture of California for long enough that the state already has a law about it. In 1982, Mr. Brown, during his first run as governor, signed the Housing Accountability Act, colloquially known as the “anti-Nimby law.”

The law bars cities from stopping developments that meet local zoning codes. In other words, it’s illegal for cities to ignore their own housing laws. The act is rarely invoked, however, because developers don’t want to sue cities for fear it will anger city councils and make it harder for them to gain approval for other developments.

Lately, the law has become a tool for activists. Two years ago, Sonja Trauss, who leads a group called the Bay Area Renters’ Federation and is running for a seat on San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors, sued Lafayette, a nearby suburb, for violating the Housing Accountability Act, and settled out of court.

Shortly after Berkeley denied the Haskell Street permit, Ms. Trauss sued the city — and won.

Photo

Berkeley agreed to give the project a new hearing and consider the Housing Accountability Act when reviewing future development. Neighbors, still incensed, continued to put pressure on the city to deny it. And the city did, this time refusing a demolition permit.

Ms. Trauss sued again, and in July a Superior Court judge for Alameda County ordered the city to issue the permit.

“Organizing alone doesn’t get us out of the crisis,” said Ryan J. Patterson, Ms. Trauss’s lawyer and a partner at Zacks, Freedman & Patterson in San Francisco. “You have to have a fist people fear.”

This almost certainly marks the beginning of a trend. Right about the time Ms. Trauss sued Berkeley, Mr. Hanlon started raising money for California Yimby. He found traction in the local technology industry, whose growth is partly responsible for the Bay Area’s housing crunch but whose employees are similarly discouraged by the astronomical rents.

Nat Friedman, a serial entrepreneur who became a vice president at Microsoft after selling his company to the software giant last year, has helped California Yimby raise close to $1 million for its efforts to lobby the state on housing issues.

“The smaller the unit of government, the harder it is to solve this problem,” Mr. Friedman said.

Mr. Hanlon’s first project was to push for a law that would make it easier to sue cities under the Housing Accountability Act. The result was S.B. 167, a bill written by Nancy Skinner, Berkeley’s state senator and a former member of the City Council. In addition to raising the legal burden of proof for cities to deny new housing projects, the bill makes the suits more expensive to defend by requiring cities that lose to pay the other side’s lawyers’ fees.

“What’s frustrating for anybody trying to build housing is that they try to play by the rules and they still get told ‘no,’” Ms. Skinner said.

Ms. Skinner’s law takes effect next year, so the long-term impact is unclear. But just a few weeks before it was signed, the Zoning Adjustments Board had another contentious housing project.

Neighbors had familiar complaints: The homes were too tall, had long shadows, and more residents would make it harder to find parking. The board’s chairman responded that he understood the concerns but couldn’t risk another lawsuit.

California isn’t going to solve its housing problem in the courts. But the basic idea — big-footing local government so that cities have a harder time blocking development — is central to the solutions that the state is pursuing.

This is a state of great ambition. It wants to lead the country on actions to reduce carbon emissions, and has enacted legislation mandating a $15 minimum wage by 2022. But housing is undermining all of it.

Even with a growing economy and its efforts to raise wages, California has the highest poverty rate in the nation, with one in five residents living in poverty, once housing costs are taken into account. And plans to reduce carbon emissions are being undermined by high home prices that are pushing people farther and farther from work.

In a brief speech before signing the recent package of housing bills, Mr. Brown talked about how yesterday’s best intentions become today’s problems. California cities have some of the nation’s strictest building regulations, and measures to do things like encourage energy efficiency and enhance neighborhood aesthetics eventually become regulatory overreach.

“City and state people did all this good stuff,” Mr. Brown said to a crowd of legislators. “But, as I always say, too many goods create a bad.”",REAL
A Radical Move: Giving Up Income to Get Health Insurance,"The vast majority of enrollees in Obamacare plans will not pay the higher premiums, since modest incomes make them eligible for another type of government subsidy that will hold their premiums flat or close to it.

But upper-middle-class people like Ms. Cornwell and her husband are expected to pay full price, feeling the blunt force of what experts and health economists agree are unbearable escalations.

Some people could qualify for Affordable Care Act subsidies through less extreme measures than those taken by Ms. Cornwell, such as shifting money into a tax-preferred savings account, like a 401(k), and reducing their taxable incomes, said Frank Caccavale, an accountant from Staten Island, N.Y. But when that is not sufficient, he counsels clients to do what Ms. Cornwell did: “This is your only option. You have to take a pay decrease.”

Ms. Cornwell hit upon her solution on her own after a month of poring over spreadsheets.

“When I saw what the premium was going to be in 2017, I had to sit down. I was shocked,” Ms. Cornwell said of the $2,100-a-month figure — for a plan that didn’t even cover care until they had each spent a $6,500 deductible. The couple simply couldn’t afford it.

Ms. Cornwell, 62, made $80,000 a year as a project manager for a small consulting firm that doesn’t offer health insurance. Her husband, Donald Donart, 63, and a cancer survivor, receives Social Security and a small pension, bringing their pretax household income to $92,000. Finding insurance required radical action.

Between 5 and 7 percent of Americans with insurance — about 17.6 million — buy it on the individual market. Of those, 7.5 million, or nearly half, don’t get subsidies, according to Robert Laszewski, an insurance industry consultant. Many in this latter group are professionals who work for small companies or are self-employed.

When Ms. Cornwell saw that premiums for 2017 would rise by hundreds of dollars a month — to three times as much as the couple paid in 2015 — they looked hard at the options:

Should they get divorced and file taxes separately so Mr. Donart’s lower income would qualify him for cheaper insurance? Too impractical because of Tennessee’s legal requirements, Ms. Cornwell decided.

Should they form a business that paid Ms. Cornwell a smaller salary than she was making? That would have taken too long.

Mr. Donart was ready to go without insurance for a year until they could figure out something else. But Ms. Cornwell worried about his cancer history, and both have chronic health conditions.

Under the Affordable Care Act, subsidies are available for people whose annual incomes are from 100 percent to about 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For 2017, that was $16,020 to $64,080 for a family of two.

So Ms. Cornwell sat down to figure out how to reduce their income to qualify.

Four spreadsheets later, Ms. Cornwell asked her boss to reduce her hours 30 percent, dropping her pay by $24,000 a year. She became a part-time hourly employee — at $56,000 a year. The couple now qualified for a $27,000 subsidy that made up for Ms. Cornwell’s lost income. They claimed their subsidy as an advance tax credit — an option under the health law — to reduce their upfront insurance costs as much as possible. The Internal Revenue Service paid their insurer directly, which reduced the couple’s premium.

Their subsidized premium was so low that they upgraded to a better silver-level plan, which carried a lower deductible than the bronze plan they had passed up.

Katy Votava, president of goodcare.com, a consulting firm that advises people about health care costs, suggests people use a financial planner for taxes and health care. “The anxiety, the uncertainty and the culture is so high, it gets in the way of people making solid decisions,” she said.

Ms. Votava generally doesn’t recommend the radical approach of drastically cutting salaries, although that may work in some cases. Instead, she tells clients to contribute as much pretax money as the Internal Revenue Service allows — and as they can afford — each year into tax-advantaged retirement and health savings accounts. That reduces taxable income, which determines whether someone qualifies for a subsidy and how much.

In 2018, people can contribute up to $18,500 a year each to a 401(k) retirement account. If they are older than 50, they can put in $6,000 more — a total of $24,500 annually. Health savings accounts, which can be used to pay eligible medical and dental expenses, provide a similar tax break. Neither was an option for Ms. Cornwell, whose small employer doesn’t offer those kinds of benefits.

Ms. Cornwell and her husband were satisfied with the subsidized plan they had this year. But she is deeply frustrated by the system and the somersaults she had to turn to make it financially viable. “This is when I should be maximizing income and putting it away, paying off the mortgage, but we’re going the other way,” she said.

She said she and her husband were looking ahead, running down the clock until they turn 65 and qualify for Medicare.

They intend to keep the same health plan in 2018 and are approaching this year’s open-enrollment event with anticipation instead of dread. Their insurer has told them to expect much higher premiums. But the government’s premium subsidies are also up significantly this year. According to healthcare.gov’s calculator, they’ll receive a much higher subsidy.

That will drop their monthly premium to zero.",REAL
American Airlines Resolves Problem That Could Have Canceled Thousands of Flights,"Photo

Faced with the prospect of sweeping flight cancellations during the busy holiday season, American Airlines said Friday that it had resolved a scheduling problem that had left thousands of flights without assigned pilots.

“Customers can rest assured we will have the full schedule covered in December,” Matt Miller, a spokesman for American Airlines, said in a phone interview on Friday evening.

More than 10,000 flights were in danger of cancellation this week after a scheduling error allowed too many pilots to take time off during the high-volume travel days of late December.

But on Friday morning, the airline’s president, Robert Isom, met with Daniel F. Carey, the president of the Allied Pilots Association, and they agreed on a plan, said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the union, which represents American Airlines pilots. “So in record time, the situation was handled,” Mr. Tajer said.

Neither the airline nor the union would share details about the agreement or how much the pilots would be compensated for taking an unassigned shift. But both said more information would be made public soon, after the pilots themselves are fully briefed on the agreement.

Who Gains From the Tax Plan? Economists Face Off,"Who Gains From the Tax Plan? Economists Face Off Republican leaders say their proposals will fuel investment and job creation. Critics say that the rich are the beneficiaries and that debt will weigh on growth. We asked two economists, one from each side, to make their cases.

There is no disagreement that changes to the tax code should promote economic growth, fuel job creation and increase incomes. The question is whether the Republican tax bills would accomplish those goals.

Several prominent conservative economists have argued that the proposals would do just that.

Many others across the ideological spectrum have challenged those conclusions, saying the plan would cause the nation’s debt to rise substantially faster than the economy. Deficit-financed tax cuts are widely believed to undermine growth.

There is also substantial disagreement about who would ultimately gain. Republican leaders argue that the substantial tax cuts for business would eventually result in wage increases. Critics counter that there is little historical evidence for that claim.

The New York Times invited two economists to offer their views in an email exchange on the plan’s economic merits and drawbacks. They are Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum, and Kimberly A. Clausing, an economist and tax expert who teaches at Reed College. Their responses were condensed and edited.

Growth

How will these tax proposals affect the economy?

Douglas Holtz-Eakin

The economic logic is straightforward and time tested. Better incentives — like lower tax rates, being able to write off investments, taxation only on earnings in the United States — will encourage innovation, investment, hiring and pay raises. These incentives increase the accumulation of capital, whether in physical equipment or intellectual know-how. This capital deepening — having more and better capital for each worker — reverses recent trends and raises productivity growth. More rapid productivity growth, in turn, raises the real wages of the middle class and restores upward mobility to a stagnant labor market.

Kimberly A. Clausing

There is nothing wrong with the idea that reducing a tax on capital will spur investment, which should increase worker productivity and, eventually, wages. But these models ignore important features of the real world, the tax code and the proposed tax law changes. First, the current tax system already encourages debt-financed investment, but that incentive actually diminishes under the proposed changes. Second, we are already living in a world awash in capital; a shortage of capital supply is not the problem holding back investment. Companies have historically high levels of after-tax profits. Why do we think giving an even larger windfall to shareholders will suddenly fuel investment? For companies to seek new investment, they need a healthy middle class. Perhaps that is why so few C.E.O. hands went up at a recent event when asked if they would use tax cuts to increase investment; few companies plan new investments in response.

BUDGET

What will be the impact on the deficit?

Ms. Clausing

The bills’ backers conveniently assume away the deficits that finance these tax cuts; such deficits are likely to either raise interest rates or increase borrowing from foreigners (such that more of the country’s income flows abroad in the future), or do both. Even estimates accounting for growth effects, by nonpartisan entities such as the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center, find that the bills increase deficits by $1 trillion to $1.25 trillion over 10 years. Those factors will be a drag on the growth of American living standards. While the backers of the bill emphasize its supply-side benefits, the growth effects of these tax bills are being vastly oversold. Future taxpayers will be left with both increased income inequality and higher debt burdens. By 2027, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, 84 percent of households will face either a tax increase or a tax cut that is smaller than $100. This will be small consolation for the future taxes needed to pay off debt.

Mr. Holtz-Eakin

A fair concern has been raised over the need for additional federal borrowing as a result of the proposed reform. Certainly the level and trajectory of the federal debt are a troubling issue, and a revenue-neutral approach would have been preferable. But it is important to get the right order of magnitude of any impact. Of the additional $1.5 trillion of additional deficits permitted by the reconciliation rules, roughly $500 billion will occur in any event, either as part of the reform or when expiring tax provisions get extended. Of the remaining $1 trillion, somewhere between $400 billion and $600 billion will be offset by additional growth. That means the Treasury will need to finance another $40 billion to $60 billion more each year. This is a drop in the bucket of the Treasury market, with inconsequential implications for the overall level of interest rates.

MULTINATIONALS

Is it worth a tax break to bring home profits booked overseas?

American businesses have booked roughly $3 trillion overseas to avoid paying United States taxes. Under the Republican plan, they would get a tax break worth about $500 billion in return for bringing the money home. Republicans argue that the money would be used to create jobs. Critics say the proposal would reward companies for tax-avoidance strategies without — based on past cases — an economic dividend.

Mr. Holtz-Eakin

The bill would stipulate that on a certain date every dollar of overseas earnings will be deemed to have been repatriated and corporations will owe their respective tax. At that point, firms face the real economic choice — bring the money back or not — not influenced by taxes . This is very different from past repatriation holidays and should be expected to have much better results. The same pro-growth incentives that influence domestic investors will apply to the overseas earnings.

Ms. Clausing

There is simply no economic rationale for a windfall to shareholders based on their prior tax avoidance, and there is no economic evidence that such windfalls promote United States investment or job creation.

WAGES

Can Americans expect to see benefits in their paychecks?

Mr. Holtz-Eakin

Faster productivity growth will translate into more compensation — wages and benefits — for workers. This is a tight historical relationship that has somehow recently become controversial, but there is research that debunks claims to the contrary.

Ms. Clausing

These tax cuts are unlikely to spur large increases in wages; careful cross-country evidence fails to find benefits to wages from corporate tax cuts. If we truly wanted to help the middle class, we would focus on its needs directly, by providing it with the lion’s share of any net tax cuts, and by ensuring that the government has the revenue needed for important infrastructure, education and health care needs as well as the flexibility to respond to the next recession.

PROSPERITY

This bill has been promoted as a boon for the middle class. Does it fulfill that promise?

Mr. Holtz-Eakin

Capital accumulation, productivity growth and living better: That is the case for tax reform. It would be an easier political sale if there were a straight line from the policy to the prosperity (which is why the left prefers programs that write checks). But the logic is sound, the evidence conclusive and the case for tax reform helping the middle class impeccable.

Ms. Clausing

This tax bill is not about workers. It is about giving shareholders and businesses lower taxes and merely hoping benefits will trickle down. Instead, give workers any tax cuts, and rely on the strength of the middle class to bubble up, strengthening American business. Sound tax reform should not lose revenue, and it should not give the vast majority of benefits to those at the top.

The Senate Tax Bill Is Expected to Change. Here’s What We Know.,"But it brings in a lot of revenue — as much as $1 trillion over the next decade — so lawmakers are now planning to reduce, rather than repeal, the tax. The Senate bill will increase the individual exemption amounts that taxpayers using the A.M.T. are entitled to and will increase the taxable income level at which those exemption amounts begin to phase out. Both moves will provide some relief to those whose income and use of deductions requires them to use the A.M.T., but it is far different from the House bill, which eliminates the tax as part of its tax code “simplification” effort.

About 30 percent of households earning $200,000 to $500,000 in 2016 are being hit by the alternative minimum tax, as are 63 percent of those earning $500,000 to $1 million, according to calculations from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. But only 20 percent of households with incomes greater than $1 million are subject to the A.M.T.

The Senate bill also retains the corporate A.M.T., which was slated for elimination in both the Senate and House bill. Together, the changes are expected to raise about $173 billion over the next decade.

State and local tax deductions are back, in a limited way.

The Senate bill is expected to allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes paid, a provision in unison with the House bill.

The original Senate bill called for elimination of the state and local tax deduction, which is primarily used in high-tax, Democrat-leaning states. But Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, insisted on including the limited property tax deduction, which will cost about $148 billion over a decade. That could ease one potential area of contention with the House bill.

Pass-through businesses score a victory.

The Senate bill will sweeten the tax deduction for owners of businesses that are organized as pass-throughs, meaning the business income is taxed at the individual owner’s tax rate.

The Senate bill will now allow those pass-through owners to deduct 23 percent of their business income, up from 17.4 percent in the original bill. That is above the 20 percent deduction in the House bill and a significant win for Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, whose family-owned business is operated as a pass-through.

The change will cost the United States government $114 billion over a decade.

The threshold for claiming medical expense deductions is reduced.

Another change pushed by Ms. Collins will lower the threshold for Americans to deduct medical expenses. Under current law, individuals can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income. The revised bill will lower that to 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, a change that will help older Americans and those with lower incomes.

However, the House bill eliminated the deduction altogether, so that will be one area of potential contention when the two chambers try to reconcile their versions. The cost of that change is unclear, as of now.

Offshore profits face a higher tax rate.

The Senate bill increases the tax rate that companies will have to pay on foreign corporate profits. The “deemed repatriation” provision in the Senate will now subject untaxed foreign corporate profits to immediate taxation at a rate of 14 percent for cash holdings and 7 percent for noncash holdings. That is up from the original proposal of 10 percent and 5 percent and in line with the House version.

The change is expected to bring in an additional $97 billion over a decade.",REAL

THE VICTORIAN INTERNET

The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century’s Online Pioneers

By Tom Standage

227 pp. Walker & Co. (1998)

In this history of the telegraph, which was developed in the United States and Britain during the 1840s, Standage demonstrates the parallels between the innovative technology of that era and today’s internet. The telegraph allowed people to communicate globally, changing the way business was conducted and even making transnational romance a possibility. Many hoped the accelerated communication would inspire greater international harmony. Standage cites a toast by the British ambassador in 1858 to “the telegraph wire, the nerve of international life, transmitting knowledge of events, removing causes of misunderstanding and promoting peace and harmony throughout the world.” The reality was less idyllic; people found ways to use the new form of communication to nefarious ends (like delaying messages or hacking private communication) and divisions were still perpetuated. But the telegraph’s cultural impact is undeniable, and Standage discusses its enduring influence in this book.

For an overview of the fight to keep the internet open, turn to this book, written by Wu, the Columbia law professor who coined the term “network neutrality,” and Harvard professor Jack Goldsmith. As the subtitle suggests, Goldsmith and Wu reckon with the idea that the internet would transcend borders and territorial rule. They cite case studies like Google’s struggle to do business in France and Yahoo’s compliance with Chinese censorship to demonstrate how governments continue to exert their influence to control the web. In his second book, “The Master Switch,” Wu discusses how consolidation in the communications industry can lead to stringent control of information by corporations and threaten the internet’s democratic design.

Broadway Casting Director Fired After Sexual Misconduct Accusations,"A prominent casting agency has fired a longtime Broadway casting director over accusations of sexual misconduct toward actors.

Justin Huff was fired early this week from Telsey + Company, according to the agency’s founder, Bernie Telsey.

“Reports were given to me of inappropriate behavior, and Justin was let go from the office,” Mr. Telsey said in an interview. “I take any reports of inappropriate behavior very seriously.” Mr. Telsey confirmed that the reports involved suspected sexual misconduct toward actors, but he declined to provide specifics.

Mr. Huff’s departure was previously reported in an industry newsletter, Broadway Briefing, and the misconduct allegation was reported in Variety.

Mr. Huff has not responded to several requests for comment this week. He had worked for Telsey + Company for 13 years, helping to select performers for a variety of stage shows, including “Kinky Boots,” “Newsies,” “On Your Feet” and the revival of “The Color Purple.”",REAL
Cognac Demands Patience and an Educated Nose,"What are the skills and traits of a good cognac blender?

First, I would say, is patience. Cognac is a brandy, so it takes time to distill the grapes into what we call eau de vie — meaning water of life — and then age it again in oak barrels for anywhere from three to 100 years.

Second, even more than a good palate, you need an educated nose. Recognizing the desired flavor requires a good palate, which can taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty and savory. But the nose is even more important.

Photo

The aromas will vary with the age of the cognac, but the most present scents are vanilla, nuts, flowers. After a first smell, we slightly swirl the cognac, bring the glass a bit closer to the nose again and inhale. We call that the cognac’s second nose.

Can you suggest words used to describe great cognac, the same way winemakers talk about their vintage?

My work is to define and to make it, not so much to describe it. I taste for potential, and how I can make what exists better to meet our very high standard of excellence. That said, some words we use are delicate, elegant, refined, full-bodied, good oak, smooth and well rounded, balanced. Balance is critical.

Why is Cognac the center for distilling cognac?

The main variety used for cognac is ugni blanc, a white grape also known as trebbiano. Here in Cognac we have the elements in which it grows best: a chalky soil, and a climate that benefits from the influence of the ocean, with winters that are not too cold and summers not too warm. This produces acidic trebbiano grapes, which make a perfect wine for our distillation process.

So now, at the age of 39 and having reached this pinnacle, what can be next for you?

It’s not a destination; it’s a journey, I have plenty to learn. The beauty of doing this is that every year is different. When the climate changes, when the rainfall changes, when we get more or less sun, the grapes change and therefore we have to adjust the distillation process and length of aging time to make the best cognac we can.",REAL
Please Don’t Make Me Ask for Another Recommendation,"Still, I feared that I had finally worn him out. He assured me that I hadn’t and that I had given him enough time to handle all these requests. But for the future, he asked me to keep in mind one rule that he asks of all students: Allow at least two weeks to prepare a recommendation letter.

“Getting a note saying ‘and the deadline is today at 5 latest’ makes me feel as if I will wilt under the pressure of a deadline that is not my own,” Mr. Shapiro said.

Because I keep finding new opportunities — or, perhaps, keep overextending myself — I often go shopping for new recommendations. Most people I approach say they are happy to help. Pride and camaraderie and fellowship are compelling: Colleagues and contemporaries usually say they would be delighted to provide recommendations. Yet sometimes I realize I am asking a colleague to complete a tedious form or write a letter during a precious holiday weekend. I feel terrible about that.

A recent enlistee, Seyward Darby, the executive editor of The Atavist Magazine, wrote a recommendation letter for me graciously. Ms. Darby says she writes from six to 10 of them each year and would like to see a streamlined system, modeled, perhaps, on the standard Common Application used by many colleges.

That “would definitely be convenient for an editor (or anyone, really) who submits recommendations on the regular,” she wrote in an email. More important, she said, “a coordinated system would be vital to freelancers.”

Ms. Darby suggested the creation of a central repository where recommendations assessing “accomplishments, skills, and character, are always waiting to be read.” That would cut down on “time and stress,” she said.

LinkedIn has already instituted a system in which recommendation letters may be viewed and shared. “It’s always been very important to understand what other people think of you,” said Hari Srinivasan, director of product management at LinkedIn. Adding reference letters to your profile leads to more opportunities, he said. “Before you even get into the process of someone asking for” a recommendation, he said, it will already be visible.

LinkedIn’s innovation is helpful, but many workplaces still ask for independent references and letters. And a professional work force could use a clearinghouse that is both more private and more inclusive: a place where recommendation letters are available only for people who have received permission to see them.

Call it iRecommend, a website in which applicants gather testimonials from people who attest to their workmanship and credibility. Those who write these letters would need to prepare only one generalized recommendation for anyone, with the ability to retract it for any reason and at any time. As someone amasses recommendations, a career path might be linked to a résumé that could guide a reviewer toward a decision.

To me, at least, this seems like a reasonable option. Until something of this nature is instituted, though, I will need to continue gathering references and recommendation letters — and writing them for people I know are worthy of them. But I do wish there were a better way.",REAL
Why Trying New Things Is So Hard to Do,"When the same choice is made over and over again, the downside of trying something different is limited and fixed — that one soda is unappealing — while the potential gains are disproportionately large. One study estimated that 47 percent of human behaviors are of this habitual variety.

Yet many people persist in buying branded products even when equivalent generics are available. These choices are noteworthy for drugs, when generics and branded options are chemically equivalent. Why continue to buy a name-brand aspirin when the same chemical compound sits nearby at a cheaper price? Scientists have already verified that the two forms of aspirin are identical. A little personal experimentation would presumably reassure you that the generic has the same effect.

Our common failure to experiment extends well past generics, as one recent study illustrates. On Feb. 5, 2014, London Underground workers went on a 48-hour strike, forcing the closings of several tube stops. The affected commuters had to find alternate routes.

When the strike ended, most people reverted to their old patterns. But roughly one in 20 stuck with the new route, shaving 6.7 minutes from what had been an average 32-minute commute.

The closings imposed by the strike forced experimentation with alternate routes, yielding valuable results. And if the strike had been longer, even more improvements would probably have been discovered.

Yet the fact that many people needed a strike to force them to experiment reveals the deep roots of a common reluctance to experiment. For example, when I think of my favorite restaurants, the ones I have visited many times, it is striking how few of the menu items I have tried. And when I think of all the lunch places near my workplace, I realize that I keep going to the same places again and again.

Habits are powerful. We persist with many of them because we tend to give undue emphasis to the present. Trying something new can be painful: I might not like what I get and must forgo something I already enjoy. That cost is immediate, while any benefits — even if they are large — will be enjoyed in a future that feels abstract and distant. Yes, I want to know what else my favorite restaurant does well, but today I just want my favorite dish.

Overconfidence also holds us back. I am unduly certain in my guesses of what the alternatives will be like, even though I haven’t tried them.

Finally, many so-called choices are not really choices at all. Walking down the supermarket aisle, I do not make a considered decision about soda. I don’t even pause at the generics. I act without thinking; I automatically grab bottles of Diet Coke as I wheel my cart by.

This is true not only in our personal lives. Executives and policymakers fail to experiment in their jobs, and these failures can be particularly costly. For example, in hiring, executives often apply their preconceived notions of which applicants will be a “good fit” as prospective employees. Yet those presumptions are nothing more than guesses and are rarely given the scrutiny of experimentation.

Hiring someone who doesn’t appear to be a good fit is surely risky, yet it might also prove the presumptions wrong, an outcome that is especially valuable when these presumptions amount to built-in advantages for men or whites or people from economically or culturally advantaged backgrounds.

For government policymakers, experimentation is a thorny issue. We are right to be wary of “experimenting” in the sense of playing with people’s lives. Yet we should also be wary of an automatic bias in favor of the status quo. That can amount to a Panglossian belief that the current policy is best, whereas the current policy may be actually be a wobbly structure held together by overconfidence, historical accident and the power of precedent.

Experimentation is an act of humility, an acknowledgment that there is simply no way of knowing without trying something different.

Not everyone bought in to that line of thought. Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic mayor of Chicago, made a very different prediction.

“All the companies that thought the last eight years were too over-regulated, in eight years they’re going to be begging for regulation,” he said. “You cannot create the Wild West on energy.”

Agriculture is ripe for innovation

The future of agriculture might be taking shape in Silicon Valley.

Agriculture, forestry and changes in land use together produce about 21 percent of global emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. With the global population expected to approach 10 billion by 2050, agriculture is a critical part of the climate puzzle.

One proposal came from Uma Valeti, a co-founder of Memphis Meats in San Leandro, Calif., which is racing to develop “clean” meats for humans that are grown from animal cells in a lab. The company hopes to to start selling its product by 2021.

The Farmers Business Network, based in San Carlos, Calif., is helping farmers aggregate data for more efficient agriculture. Nancy E. Pfund, whose venture capital firm DBL Partners is helping to finance the group, said the fund was helping farmers understand when they use too much water, electricity or seeds, “not because they’re doing it wrong, but because they haven’t had that data to understand how to optimize.”

Cities are on the front lines of climate change

Both Mr. Emanuel and Edwin M. Lee, the mayor of San Francisco, said climate change was increasingly a municipal issue.

“As we get these rains that come in torrents, my Embarcadero roadway gets flooded,” Mr. Lee said. “It comes over the piers. It used to never happen like that.”

Mr. Emanuel said his city was experiencing unusual weather extremes. Just a few years ago a blizzard dumped 24 inches of snow in less than 12 hours — while last year Chicago saw its driest winter since record-keeping began.

Mayors of 80 North American cities will meet in Chicago next week, Mr. Emanuel said, to sign “customized, very specific benchmark plans” to help meet former President Barack Obama’s pledge under the Paris agreement to cut domestic emissions at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

Nuclear makes news

Michael Shellenberger, the founder of the nuclear advocacy group Environmental Progress, announced on Thursday that he intends to run for governor of California. Support for nuclear energy is, not surprisingly, is a key part of his platform.

Mr. Shellenberger, who described himself as a lifelong Democrat, said he was running as an independent. He declined to say how much money he had raised, and said his sole endorsement so far came from James Hansen, the former director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies who is a supporter of nuclear energy.

“He’s the only one I’ve asked,” Mr. Shellenberger said. But, he added, “I’m running to win.”",REAL
Sending Out an SOS: The Rise of Travel Security Apps,"The Getaway Sending Out an SOS: The Rise of Travel Security Apps Safety apps aim to offer assurance on the road. Image Credit Wesley Bedrosian

From transferring money to buying airline tickets, smartphone apps can be a traveler’s high-tech multitasker. But can they keep travelers safe? A new crop of apps seeks to offer that assurance.

They may be cashing in on a sense of insecurity wrought by more frequent terrorist events, including the truck attack in Lower Manhattan in October, and recent natural disasters like hurricanes.

“There are more risks now than in the past, but that doesn’t make travel more dangerous,” said Matthew Bradley, the regional director of security for International SOS, a medical and travel security risk services company. He cited the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris as ushering in the risk of terrorism to Europe that was once seen as unlikely .

Still, car accidents and petty crimes such as pickpocketing are much more common travel threats than terrorism or kidnapping. To mitigate these risks, experts advise hiring drivers in foreign countries, carrying little cash and dressing inconspicuously to avoid attracting attention.

“Americans have a lot of tells,” said Bruce A. Alexander, a terrorism expert and the former Iraq program manager in the antiterrorism office at the State Department. “Leave the San Diego State sweatshirt at home.”

Supplementing these practices, security apps deliver incident updates in the location where a user is traveling. Notifications range from supplying country profiles before departure to alerts about disease outbreaks. Many also contain a panic button to summon assistance in an emergency.

While few of these security apps replace travel insurance, which covers the cost of a medical emergency or evacuation, many do provide a range of services designed to keep travelers safe.

Tracking users and triggering cost-free evacuations

A new app from the London-based security firm Drum Cussac, CloseCircle, which is scheduled to be available this month (December), is designed to act as a security monitor and emergency evacuation service. The app digitally transmits your location to staff at headquarters (the firm says it just uses three percent of your phone’s battery power over 24 hours). When an emergency such as a terrorist attack or a hurricane occurs where you are traveling, company employees will call, check in and advise users on avoiding risk and getting out of harm’s way. When under threat, users can also engage an SOS button that summons a response from its agents.

Unlike other security apps, CloseCircle membership guarantees a cost-free evacuation in the event of life-threatening danger. The service is backed by an insurance policy that covers the expenses.

“CloseCircle is aiming to be pre-emptive wherever possible and to actually warn members away from dangers that they may not even yet be aware of,” Simon Philips, the chairman of Drum Cussac, wrote in an email.

Terms: Annual memberships cost £195 a person, or about $260; £349 a couple; and £595 for a family of up to six people; closecircle.com.

Tracking users on demand

Developed by Incident Management Group, a firm that specializes in the security of business travelers and individuals, FoneTrac allows users to check in at the press of a button to let the firm and anyone on their designated contact list know that they are fine. The company also monitors security developments worldwide and will send a message to app users if anything from a terrorist attack to an earthquake is going on where they are. In the event of an emergency, a panic button provides the firm your location and triggers g round support .

The app does not track a user’s physical location continuously, except in the event of a panic alert when it runs continuously, but inconspicuously, until it is physically turned off.

Focusing on health and safety

Established in 2012 and available on a mobile app since 2013, Sitata sends out “Trip Alerts” that cover any potentially travel-disrupting event, other than the usual flight delays. These could be disease outbreaks, violent protests, extreme weather or transit strikes. The coverage is global and the firm uses artificial intelligence to monitor the media, traditional and social, to track events worldwide.

Founded by Ron St. John, the former director of emergency preparedness for Canada, and his son Adam St. John, the app was initially developed to disseminate public health information and expanded to more broadly address security. It remains strong in tracking disease outbreaks; the app will even inform users after they have returned from a trip if a disease such as dengue fever has broken out where they were traveling and if there was an incubation period.

“This is important because you may come home and start to feel sick and go to your doctor and forget to say you were in Brazil, which could lead to misdiagnosis,” said Adam St. John, the chief executive officer of Sitata.

Terms: Free for now, though the company plans to change in 2018 to a modestly priced subscription service; sitata.com.

Emergency alerts in New York and San Francisco

Currently available only in New York and San Francisco, the new app Citizen alerts users to some events that have triggered a 911 call to local authorities. This could be any emergency related to public safety such as a bank robbery, fire or terrorist attack.

If the event takes place within a quarter mile of your location, and the app is running, you will receive a push notification with the alert. Users are also able to discuss the incidents among themselves via the app, which displays a map showing where incidents are occurring.

Originally launched as Vigilante, the company quickly rebranded after it became aware the name appeared to incite citizen action. “The name didn’t match our goal which is to keep people safe and not to encourage them to intervene and disrupt police officers,” said Lea Artz, a spokeswoman for Citizen.

A smartwatch panic button

ADT, the home security company, has announced its intention to follow its customers beyond their homes with its first app, ADT Panic Response, available only on Samsung Gear S2 and Gear S3 smartwatches.

Watch wearers can engage the app in an emergency, which transmits a GPS location and connects to an ADT agent to dispatch help. The service is only available in the United States.

“We like wearables because someone who might go out running tends not to take a smartphone with them because it’s bulky and heavy,” said Jay Darfler, the senior vice president of emerging markets at ADT. In the running example, he added, the user had turned his ankle in the woods, was unable to walk and summoned help via the watch app. The company plans to launch a related smartphone app next year.

Terms: $10 a month; adtcanopy.com.
