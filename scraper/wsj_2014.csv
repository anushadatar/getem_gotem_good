Australia Woes Boost Rate-Cut Bets,"The Australian dollar remains elevated, presenting a challenge for the central bank as it seeks to cushion the economy from lower growth in China and a slowdown in mining investment. Bloomberg News

SYDNEY—Tumbling commodity prices and signs of slowdown in China have reversed bets on the chances of an Australian rate cut next year.

As recently as two weeks ago, financial markets were pricing in a negligible chance of interest rates—currently at a record low to help spur a weak economy—moving up or down for at least the next year.

But after weak Chinese manufacturing data, Japan diving into recession, and a continuing decline in the price of Australia’s biggest export, iron ore, markets are factoring in a 71% chance of a rate cut in late 2015 and a 50% likelihood of one even earlier, analysis of the interest rate swap market showed.

At the start of the year, the consensus expectation was for a rate rise sometime next year.

Australia’s central bank left its policy rate at 2.5% on Tuesday, as expected, to help cushion the economy against the end of a mining-investment boom, while indicating it intends to keep it low for some time yet. The last time the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates was in August 2013, at the end of a long string of gradual reductions dating back to late 2011.

Until now, economists had virtually ruled out the chance of rates dipping any lower before rising again. The current mood in markets comes after a plunge in the price of iron ore, which has tumbled by around 50% since the start of the year to its lowest level since June 2009.

Other commodities have also weakened, including coal, copper and gold, denying resource-rich Australia the stellar export-price boom anticipated after a decade spent investing in mine, port and rail infrastructure.

The current market pricing also reflects a major turnaround from earlier this year when economists were making confident forecasts Australia would recover relatively quickly from the end of the mining boom.

On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank dramatically changed its interest-rate forecasts, saying the fall in commodity prices meant it no longer expected a rate increase in 2016, and that it now saw two quarter-point rate cuts by the end of next year amid rising unemployment—which would drag the cash rate down to a new record-low of 2.0%.

Adam Boyton, chief economist of the Australian arm of the investment bank, said the central bank would be more open to cutting interest rates now that new regulation restricting lending to property investors was in the offing, lessening the risk of a housing-market crash that could upturn the economy.

Deutsche Bank joins Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse in recently turning significantly more bearish on Australia. Trouble in Australia’s key trading partners, including Japan, has further fed rising doubts about the country’s economic prospects. Growth in China’s manufacturing sector slowed in November, adding to concern that its economy will cool in 2015.

Kieran Davies, chief economist at Barclays , Australia, is among those holding to the belief that the next move in Australian interest rates will be up. However, he said the central bank could afford to keep rates at the current level for longer than he’d originally thought. Mr. Davies pushed back his forecast for a rate increase to the third quarter from the first quarter of next year.

A sharp drop in the Australian dollar, or Aussie as it is known, in recent months against the U.S. currency has given Australia’s commodity exporters some relief from the steep price declines. But on Tuesday, the reserve bank said it wasn’t satisfied the Aussie, which has barely moved against a basket of major currencies, had fallen enough.

“The Australian dollar remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices in recent months,” Gov. Glenn Stevens said in a statement accompanying Tuesday’s decision to hold rates. “A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth.”

Some economists said the comments reflected frustration the currency wasn’t falling fast enough to match sinking commodity prices. The Aussie dollar hit a fresh four-year low US$0.8420 on Monday.

The drop in commodity prices has also thrown the government’s budget off course, forcing revenue write-downs that will impair its ability to deliver a surplus before the end of the decade. Australia is expected to announce reasonably solid growth for the third quarter on Wednesday, but economic activity outside of mining looks set to remain sluggish.

"Obama Calls for Policing Standards, Funding in Wake of Ferguson","President Obama discusses the creation of a task force to promote accountability and transparency between police and communities after the shooting in Ferguson, Mo. Photo: Getty.

WASHINGTON—The White House on Monday defended federal programs that equip local police departments with military gear but called for new standards to guide them, amid criticism that the programs “militarize’’ the police and added to tensions during the protests in Ferguson, Mo.

President Barack Obama said his administration would develop new rules for the programs, adding that more transparency and consistency is needed to ensure that police use the equipment safely. The president, though, isn’t seeking to scale back the programs, and senior administration officials said the focus was on improving oversight.

“We found that in many cases these programs actually serve a very useful purpose,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.

The president also asked lawmakers to fund body-worn cameras and other community policing initiatives at a three-year cost of $263 million. Of that amount, $75 million would be used to buy as many as 50,000 of the cameras, which record police actions.

Monday’s announcements were among the White House’s first prescriptions for building trust between police and communities after the violent protests in Ferguson. They came on a day when Mr. Obama spent much of his time grappling with the fallout of a grand jury’s decision not to indict a white police officer for the fatal shooting in August of an unarmed, black 18-year-old in the St. Louis suburb.

Mr. Obama said Monday that events in Ferguson had laid bare “a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color.” The steps announced Monday were aimed at ensuring that law-enforcement officials and the communities they serve are partners in battling crime, the president said.

The police response to the protests and violence after the shooting drew attention to federal programs that outfit police with military gear, with critics saying they create mistrust between law enforcement and communities. Supporters say the programs provide useful equipment to police departments that are often strapped for funds.

A review ordered by Mr. Obama, released Monday, reported that the equipment is provided by five agencies, which are governed by a variety of policies. Agencies do little to coordinate efforts and often lack mechanisms to hold police accountable for misusing equipment, the review said.

Mr. Obama directed his staff to draft an executive order to develop common standards for the programs. He said the new standards would ensure that law enforcement agencies aren’t building a militarized culture.

The president had initially sounded a more critical tone when he called for the review in August, saying that “there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) said Monday the law should be changed to end the transfer of military equipment. “If they quit sending bayonets to police forces it’d be a good start,” Mr. Paul said.

Trevor Burrus, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he was concerned by what appeared to be a lack of political will to take a hard look at the transfers of military equipment to police. “It is possible to constrain these programs with oversight, but it doesn’t seem like many people are really wanting to do it,” Mr. Burrus said. “The gear that they have needs to be reassessed…some of it has no legitimate law enforcement purpose,” he said.

The administration’s review found that local law-enforcement agencies across the country possess 460,000 pieces of property with military attributes, among them night-vision devices, Humvees and mine-resistant vehicles.

The president also plans to issue an executive order creating a task force on policing, which will look at ways to reduce crime while building public trust, officials said. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey and Laurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University and a former assistant attorney general, will lead it, officials said.

Mr. Obama’s funding request would increase the use of body-worn cameras, expand training for law-enforcement agencies and take other steps aimed at improving community policing, senior administration officials said.

Jim Bueermann, president of the nonpartisan Police Foundation, praised the push for thousands more body-worn cameras, saying they are the best available technology that could help answer questions about particular interactions with police. Still, cameras alone aren’t a panacea, he said.

“This is really about the public’s confidence in the police,” Mr. Bueermann said.

President Obama pushes for a $200 million community policing initiative in the wake of the shooting in Ferguson, Mo., which includes body cameras. WSJ’s Colleen McCain Nelson joins the News Hub. Photo: Getty.

The administration will ask for the money that would fund the community policing initiative to be included as part of an omnibus spending bill that would keep the government running after its current funding expires Dec. 11. Leaders of both parties had hoped to pass the omnibus bill, which ties together 12 individually tailored spending bills that would fund agencies through September 2015, but it wasn’t clear that they had the votes to do so in the GOP-controlled House.

Mr. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met Monday afternoon with several members of the cabinet, young people involved in civil-rights issues and, separately, with elected officials, religious leaders, law-enforcement officials and others to discuss how police departments and citizens can work together to improve relations. Those invited to the White House included the mayors of New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Milwaukee and Gary, Ind.

The meetings came one week after a grand jury cleared Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in an investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown. Mr. Wilson resigned from the force over the weekend.

A federal investigation into whether Mr. Wilson or the Ferguson Police Department violated federal civil-rights laws is ongoing.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, speaking in Atlanta Monday night, said the Justice Department would soon announce new profiling guidance for federal law enforcement. Mr. Holder said the guidance “will institute rigorous new standards—and robust safeguards—to help end racial profiling, once and for all.”

Mr. Holder, whose remarks were briefly interrupted by protesters, spoke during a meeting with African-American church leaders and law-enforcement officials at Ebenezer Baptist Church, the congregation once served by Martin Luther King Jr.

Mr. Holder’s visit to Atlanta was the first of several community meetings that he plans to attend to discuss African-American relations with law enforcement following the protests over Ferguson.

Demonstrations continued Monday, as the advocacy group Ferguson Action helped coordinate some 40 walkouts and demonstrations on campuses and in cities across the U.S. on the anniversary of Rosa Parks’s arrest for refusing to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Ala.

“It sends a message that 59 years after Rosa Parks that small, coordinated action can send a big message,” said Mervyn Marcano, spokesman for Ferguson Action. “There are simple and easy ways for people to plug in and show they connect with Ferguson.”

Hackers Targeted Companies’ Merger Talks,"Cyberthieves may be targeting those involved in mergers, acquisitions and other market-moving events. WSJ's Brian Fitzgerald and Simon Constable discuss. Photo: iStock/jaminwell

A group of cyberthieves may be attempting to gain an edge on Wall Street by targeting chief financial officers, advisory firms and others involved in mergers, acquisitions and other market-moving events, according to computer security firm FireEye . FEYE -0.28%

In one case, the group focused on employees privy to changes in closely watched government-reimbursement rates at a publicly traded health-sector firm. In another, hackers posed as an adviser to one of two companies in a potential acquisition.

Since the middle of last year, these hackers penetrated more than 100 companies that are either publicly traded or advising publicly traded firms, FireEye said. Most of the targets are health-care or pharmaceutical companies, FireEye said; it declined to name specific firms.

FireEye said it alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation of its findings during the past week.

The FBI declined to comment.

“There’s nothing else that this could have been going after other than to game the market,” said Jen Weedon, a manager at FireEye’s Mandiant unit, best known for researching foreign hackers.

On multiple occasions, FireEye said the group targeted several parties involved in the same business deal, including law firms and consultants. FireEye researchers said they aren’t aware of any irregular trading linked to their findings.

Cyberattacks have long targeted information that could be handy for investors trying to gain a leg up. But former U.S. officials and experts at other security firms say they’ve not seen evidence suggesting hacked information was behind a suspicious trade.

FireEye’s Mandiant team said the newly disclosed hacking activity appears different than hacking that has been linked to foreign governments. Cyberattacks linked to China, for example, also involve stealing nonpublic information from listed companies. But in those instances the intruders try to steal every bit of information they can, sort of like a vacuum cleaner, hoping to figure out what data has value later.

In the recent cases, hackers appear to target specific employees—particularly those with access to potentially market-moving information— and seek specific sets of data, FireEye said. Moreover, it said the hackers appear to speak English.

One common technique, FireEye said, is a simple trick where the hackers embed prompts for Microsoft Outlook usernames and passwords inside corporate documents they send to executives. Once a recipient enters a username and password, hackers can take over an email account, then send emails to other employees who may be working on a deal.

In some cases, they then strike up conversations with other executives, apparently hoping to gain more information, FireEye said.

That’s risky, because imitating another person’s tone on email is difficult. So the hackers used Microsoft Outlook’s filter settings to hide emails to victims that contain the words “hacked,” “phish” or “malware,” FireEye said. The filter would block a message such as, “This email doesn’t sound like you, Bob. You get hacked?”

In one email meant to trick an executive to hand over email account information, the hackers warned that another employee “may have unwittingly divulged confidential company information regarding pending transactions” in a rant posted on an investment message board.

“This smells very different” than Chinese hacking investigated by Mandiant, Ms. Weedon said. She added the hackers could be “home grown” or based in Western Europe.

FireEye’s disclosure Monday comes as the financial services sector has dramatically upped its spending on cybersecurity, which could prove to a boon for companies like FireEye and large consulting firms like Deloitte. Financial services companies plan to boost cybersecurity budgets by a combined $2 billion during the next two years, according to a November report by the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which also provides anti-hacking services.

"Lower Oil Prices Will Help Boost Global Economy, IMF’s Lagarde Says","At the 2014 WSJ CEO Council Annual Meeting, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde explains the impact for falling oil prices on the global economy.

WASHINGTON—International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde on Monday said falling oil prices will help boost economies in the U.S. and across much of the globe, a net positive for a world struggling with slowing growth.

“It is good news for the global economy,” Ms. Lagarde said at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting.

Oil prices tumbled to multiyear lows last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to maintain its production quotas, rather than lowering its output target. Lower oil prices are good for most consumers, who pay less for gasoline, but could squeeze energy companies and the economies of some major producers like Russia and Venezuela.

For the U.S., lower energy prices will help accelerate economic growth to a 3.5% pace next year, Ms. Lagarde said, up from an October forecast of 3.1%.

The U.S. economy has been stuck at around 2% annual growth since the recession officially ended about 5½ years ago—gross domestic product expanded 2.2% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2012.

While the U.S. appears to be a bright spot in the world, other nations are struggling.

The eurozone still faces high unemployment, wary consumers and painfully weak economies among 18 member states. Japan slipped into recession in the third quarter. Emerging economies also have shown signs of trouble. China’s gross domestic product grew by 7.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, its slowest pace in more than five years, and India decelerated to 5.3% from 5.7% the prior quarter.

Europe also is expected to benefit from lower oil prices, though the eurozone also faces a risk of the “new mediocre,” Ms. Lagarde said, describing an economy marked by slow growth, low inflation and high unemployment.

To break out, reluctant political leaders need to adopt more job-friendly labor market reforms, aggressive and innovative monetary policy and other structural reforms, she said.

“Where they are at the moment they need to use all available tools,” Ms. Lagarde said. “They have to get on with it and do it.”

Ms. Lagarde also took Japan to task for slow implementation of fiscal and labor market reforms.

One key area for Japan: opening up its labor force to women and immigrants. “There is no slack in the Japanese economy, so when they do stimulus, when they put money into the construction business for instance, there is nobody to build,” she said.

Falling energy prices won’t help everyone.

“Winners and losers—exporters are taking a hit,” she said.

For Russia, lower prices are “adding to their fragility and their vulnerability,” Ms. Lagarde said.

The Big Number: 13,"13

The number of publicly traded U.S. companies that said they were going private this year.

Record stock prices have curbed the number of companies that leveraged-buyout firms want to take private. Just 13 firms have announced they would go private so far this year. That is the fewest since 2001, when just 10 public companies announced, according to data provider Dealogic.

With stock prices up, “bargains are more difficult to find,” said Richard Peterson, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ. Take-private LBOs totaled $11.6 billion, down 83% from 2013’s year-to-date total of $68.9 billion.

Instead, private-equity firms are increasingly buying specialized divisions rather than their larger parent companies, Mr. Peterson said. Carlyle Investment Management LLC announced it would buy Johnson & Johnson ’s ortho-clinical diagnostics division for $4.15 billion in January.

Low interest rates and high stock prices, Mr. Peterson said, mean investors are “waiting for the pullback that, you know, never happens until something cataclysmic happens and then everything gets swept down.”

Some companies are willing to sell only low-performing divisions, he said, mentioning Procter & Gamble Co.’s agreement last month to sell Duracell to Berkshire Hathaway for $4.7 billion. A Procter & Gamble spokesman countered that the deal shows a “vote of confidence” in Duracell.

Tibco Software Inc. was the largest company to announce its public departure this year, at $4.3 billion. Telecommunications-equipment company Riverbed Technology Inc. and software firm Compuware Corp. will do the same in deals valued at $3.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.

But those deals are dwarfed by last year’s largest. H.J. Heinz Co. went private in a $27.5 billion leveraged buyout, and Dell went off the market for $24.4 billion.

Supreme Court Weighs When Social-Media Threats Become Criminal Acts,"This case is being watched closely as a test of free speech protections and what counts as a threat in the age of the Internet. Reuters

WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday waded into the question of when a social-media posting rises to the level of a criminal threat, in a case examining a Pennsylvania man’s conviction following comments he made to his estranged wife and others on Facebook.

The closely watched case pits law-enforcement and victims’ rights groups against free-speech advocates, and it could affect how freely individuals can speak online and in traditional forums. To underscore that point, Monday’s hourlong oral argument featured discussions between the justices and lawyers about violent rap music and tweets about the turmoil in Ferguson, Mo.

The justices searched for a middle ground that would protect free speech yet allow prosecutors to target people who make “true threats.” Past Supreme Court rulings have said the government can prohibit such threats, but it hasn’t always been clear what they are.

At issue was the 2011 conviction of Anthony Elonis for posting threats on Facebook against his estranged wife, law enforcement and local elementary schools. Mr. Elonis, who served about three years in prison for the conviction, had written several posts on his Facebook page that discussed harming his wife, including after she obtained a protective order against him.

In one post in the form of rap lyrics, Mr. Elonis wrote, “Fold up your [order] and put it in your pocket/Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?”

Mr. Elonis has said his rap-styled online posts were a “therapeutic” way to deal with his troubles.

Facebook isn’t a party to the case and declined to comment on Monday. Facebook and other social-media sites such as Twitter and YouTube have rules for managing individual speech online and enjoy legal protections from liability for material posted by users.

The court took the case to decide what prosecutors must prove to win a conviction against someone charged with making criminal threats. The justices considered several possible legal standards. Should prosecutors have to show a defendant intended to threaten someone? Does the defendant at least have to know his comments would cause the target of his communications to feel threatened? Or is it enough, as prosecutors argued, that a “reasonable person” would perceive an Internet posting as a threat?

John Elwood, a lawyer for Mr. Elonis, said prosecutors should have to show that someone accused of making threats intended to put the listener in fear. Merely being reckless with comments on Facebook or elsewhere shouldn’t be enough to make someone guilty, he said.

“Many of the people who are being prosecuted now are teenagers who are essentially shooting off their mouths or making sort of ill-timed, sarcastic comments which wind up getting them thrown in jail,” Mr. Elwood said.

He cited a Texas prosecution of a teenager who made remarks in a videogame chat room about attacking a school. And he suggested the government’s preferred legal approach would allow the prosecution of someone from Ferguson who tweeted a violent message along with a picture of police officers during the riots.

Mr. Elwood’s arguments drew sharp responses from some justices. Justice Samuel Alito said Mr. Elonis’s position “sounds like a road map for threatening a spouse and getting away with it.” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned how prosecutors could prove what was in someone’s mind when they made allegedly threatening Internet posts.

Justice Alito also raised concerns about one of Mr. Elonis’s Facebook posts that talked about shooting a kindergarten class, reading it to the courtroom during the arguments session: “Enough elementary schools in a 10-mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined/And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class/The only question is…which one?”

The justice questioned whether it made sense to require juries to “get into the mind of this obsessed, somewhat disturbed individual” to try to determine whether he really meant to threaten.

The federal government’s position also ran into trouble. Justice Elena Kagan said the government’s proposed standard seemed to be that someone could be guilty if he should have known that his posts would cause someone to feel threatened. She said that standard was too low. “That’s not the kind of standard that we typically use in the First Amendment,” she said.

Justices Kagan and Stephen Breyer signaled they were considering an approach that didn’t fully embrace either side’s arguments. Justice Anthony Kennedy raised the possibility the case could be sent back for new trial-court proceedings with different jury instructions.

Chief Justice John Roberts, meanwhile, asked whether the government’s approach potentially would expose rap artists to prosecution for songs containing violent threats in them. The chief justice quoted lyrics from an Eminem song about a domestic dispute that Mr. Elonis’s lawyers cited in their written brief. Mr. Roberts noted the lyrics included, “Da-da make a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake,” and “There goes mama splashing in the water, no more fighting with dad.”

Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben said juries need to consider the context for allegedly threatening statements. Eminem’s rap songs are a form of entertainment, while Mr. Elonis’s posts weren’t, he said.

Mr. Elonis “knows that his wife is reading these posts. He knows that his posts, despite the fact that they’re in the guise of rap music, have instilled fear in her,” Mr. Dreeben said.

In 1969, the court threw out the conviction of a man who said at a public rally that if he were drafted into the Army and forced to carry a rifle, “the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.”

In 2003, the court ruled Virginia could criminalize cross-burning “done with the intent to intimidate,” because of its long history as a signal of impending violence.

A decision in Elonis v. U.S. is expected by the end of June.

Memory Chip Makers to Merge,"Cypress Semiconductor Corp. CY -5.12% and Spansion Inc., two Silicon Valley companies known for memory chips used in many consumer and business technologies, agreed to combine in a deal that values Spansion at about $1.6 billion.

The deal will unite complementary technologies that go unseen by most people but are crucial for the proper functioning of car-braking systems, hand-held medical devices and storing software in cellphones. Cypress specializes in a variety of memory chips called SRAM, and Spansion is in a type called NOR flash.

The companies said the deal was a “merger of equals” with shareholders in Cypress and Spansion each slated to own half the stock in the merged company. T.J. Rodgers, the chief executive of Cypress, will be CEO of the new company, while Spansion’s Ray Bingham will serve as nonexecutive chairman. Each company will get four board seats, the companies said Monday.

Spansion shareholders will receive 2.457 Cypress shares for each Spansion share they hold.

The all-stock deal valued Spansion at $1.6 billion, or $25.63 a share, based on Cypress’s closing share price Monday of $10.43.

Spansion shares finished regular market trading Monday at $22.85 each, but the stock price rose 14% in after hours trading to $26.

Cypress shares rose 9.8% to $11.45 in after-hours trading.

The companies valued the transaction at $4 billion. A Cypress spokesman wasn’t immediately available to comment.

In an interview, Mr. Rodgers and Spansion CEO John Kispert said the companies had similar corporate cultures and complementary product lines. Mr. Kispert said Spansion has a strong foothold in auto and industrial technology, while Cypress’s strength are in consumer-electronics devices and an emerging area known as the “Internet of Things” that includes clothing or roadways laced with sensors, transmitters or processors.

Spansion and Cypress are survivors in the increasingly competitive world of microcontrollers.

“It’s a no-nonsense mentality that memory companies have to have to survive. Both companies have that,” Mr. Rodgers said.

The companies said Monday that they expect the merger to close in the first half of next year. The combined company will be based in San Jose and keep the name Cypress Semiconductor. The combined company is expected to generate annual revenue of about $2 billion, Cypress and Spansion said.

The deal is expected to generate cost savings of more than $135 million annually within three years and add to per-share earnings—excluding one-time items—in the first full year after the deal closes.

According to a regulatory filing, in the event that either Cypress or Spansion cancel the deal, that company ending the agreement would pay the other firm a termination fee of $60 million and/or reimburse the other company as much as $5 million in expenses.

AOL bought Vidible, a marketplace for online video content that connects content providers and publishers in need of video. Reuters

Financial terms weren’t disclosed.

Philadelphia Mayor Signals Support For Mandatory Sick-Leave Law,"Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter signaled his support for a mandatory sick-leave law Monday, putting the city on track to join three states and 16 other U.S. cities with such requirements, including California and New York City.

“A healthy worker is a happy worker, and it’s a person that’s ultimately going to be more productive and just spreading a lot less stuff around the workplace,” Mr. Nutter said after accepting the report of a 14-member mayoral task force formed to study the issue.

The report calls for the city to require employers with at least 15 workers to provide up to 40 hours of paid sick leave a year. Smaller employers would have to give their workers up to 40 hours of unpaid sick time annually under the recommendations.

The Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce said it would wait for legislation to take a position. “The competitiveness issue is a real one,” said public policy director Joe Grace. “It’s fair to say many members of the chamber—viable businesses in the city—still have concerns about that.”

Mr. Nutter vetoed similar legislation in 2011 and 2013, saying he worried about the impact on city businesses and hiring. He said the strengthened local economy made this a good time to revisit the issue.

The first city to mandate paid sick leave for most employers was San Francisco, in 2006, according to the task force. Since 2011, 14 other cities have imposed similar requirements, as have three states: Connecticut, California and Massachusetts.

The Philadelphia proposal would exempt certain workers, including federal and state employees, those covered by collective bargaining and temporary workers. Enforcement of the requirements should be complaint-driven, the task force concluded.

The mandate, if enacted, would largely affect hotels and restaurants, said task force member Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. The task force estimates that 35% to 40% of city workers, or about 200,000, lack paid sick leave, including many low-income women and minorities.

Mr. Cappelli said providing paid sick leave has a small impact on employer costs, and the absence of such benefits only encourages sick employees to go to work, where they can contribute little.

Another task force member, Pete Ellis, who owns a restaurant called El Fuego, said his 12 workers get paid sick leave. Having a sick worker on duty creates the potential for spreading an infection to other employees and customers, he said.

"Oil Rebounds, But Few See a Bottom","U.S. oil prices posted their biggest one-day gain in two years on Monday as traders locked in profits on bearish bets following last week’s selloff.

But many market watchers were skeptical that Monday’s gains signaled that oil prices had reached their bottom, pointing to global supplies that continue to overwhelm demand.

Oil prices tumbled to multiyear lows after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided on Thursday to maintain its production quotas, rather than agreeing to support prices by lowering its output target.

The group’s decision sent shock waves through financial markets that continued to be felt on Monday. Shares of some U.S. oil producers added to last week’s declines, highlighting concerns about these companies’ ability to operate expensive shale-oil fields amid plunging prices. Bonds of low-rated energy companies also sank, reflecting fears that some producers will default if prices fail to recover.

Many investors and analysts believe with OPEC on the sidelines it will take cutbacks by companies in the U.S. and Canada to bring supply and demand in line and pull the market out of its swoon. That day may not come until deep into 2015 or beyond, some analysts say.

“The era of $100 [a barrel] oil is over,” Citigroup said in a note. “Oil prices appear to be falling rapidly to—if they haven’t already reached—production costs.”

On Monday, light, sweet oil for January delivery shot up 4.3% to $69.00 a barrel from Friday’s close, recovering from a more-than five-year low below $64 a barrel hit in overnight trading. It was the biggest one-day percentage gain for the U.S. benchmark since August 2012. Brent futures, the international benchmark, gained 3.4% to end at $72.54 a barrel.

Investors said much of Monday’s activity was driven by traders closing out profitable bets on falling prices or opening positions that would protect them should the market rebound. Both the U.S. benchmark and Brent slumped Thursday and Friday to fresh multiyear lows, posting two-day losses of about 10%.

“Today’s a little bit more of a rebound from Friday’s plastering,” rather than a long-lasting change in direction, said Kyle Cooper, analyst at IAF Advisors in Houston. “We got [to five-year lows] really quick, and it’s not an entirely bad thing to take some profits.”

Roland Austrup, who manages $54 million as chief executive of Integrated Managed Futures Corp., said his funds posted 6% gains in November largely due to a bet that oil prices would fall. After last week’s selloff, he kept his wagers on lower oil prices but used options to reduce losses in case prices rose.

“Anytime you get a big significant move like this, it’s prudent to hedge,” Mr. Austrup said. “It certainly doesn’t reflect a view that it’s over...There’s no impetus for prices to go up.”

Volatility in the oil market has caught out some funds. Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP plans to close its $630 million commodity hedge fund after the fund suffered heavy losses in energy markets in September, people familiar with the fund said Saturday.

The slump in oil prices is pressuring energy companies, and analysts and bankers expect a string of deal-making as highly levered companies become attractive for acquisition.

Halliburton Co. is in the process of buying rival oil-service company Baker Hughes Inc. Weatherford International PLC on Monday said it agreed to sell its engineered-chemistry and drilling-fluids businesses to an affiliate of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Lubrizol unit. Weatherford said it expects to use proceeds from the deal, which is expected to close before the end of the year, to pay down debt.

Some investors are looking for signs that slumping oil prices could spark higher demand, and U.S. employment data on Friday will be a key indicator, said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. Higher employment can spur more gasoline demand, as more commuters drive to work. The national average price of retail gasoline was $2.77 a gallon Monday, down 50 cents from a year ago.

Workers prepare a new well pad near Firestone, Colo. in October. Reuters

Upcoming macroeconomic reports “will be looked at as a demand indicator and the energy market will adjust itself accordingly,” Mr. Yawger said.

But without action from OPEC, the market will remain oversupplied, said Barclays in a note. Barclays lowered its oil-price forecasts for this year and next after the OPEC meeting, as did BNP Paribas SA and Citigroup Inc. Barclays now expects Brent prices to average $72 a barrel next year, while BNP forecasts $77 a barrel and Citi has called for $80 a barrel.

“It will have to endure a volatile adjustment period while non-OPEC supply, demand and even some OPEC producers adjust,” analysts at Barclays said.

January reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, rose 5.34 cents, or 2.9%, to $1.8810 a gallon.

January diesel gained 5.12 cents, or 2.4%, to $2.2124 a gallon.

OPEC’s War Won’t Be All Over by Christmas,"Like invasions of Russia and land battles in Asia, a war on U.S. shale promises to be a protracted and unpredictable campaign.

Rising U.S. shale oil output is one target of Saudi Arabia’s push to have OPEC members maintain their output and so depress oil prices. Even leaving aside OPEC’s clutch of internal divisions, though, fighting U.S. shale will prove a grind—with substantial attrition on the cartel’s side.

Part of OPEC’s problem is that U.S. shale is a many-headed beast, with multiple resource basins and operators. So there isn’t a single price below which production gets shut down. Rather, estimates of break-even prices in U.S. shale span a range: Citigroup , for one, estimates this to be around $70 to $90 a barrel using full-cycle costs.

“Full-cycle costs” is the crucial phrase, as it incorporates big up front charges such as acquiring land. In core shale regions where land and infrastructure is already locked up, the cost to keep drilling could be as low as $40, Citi estimates. Benchmark U.S. crude now trades at about $68.

Look at oil’s last big collapse, from almost $150 to less than $40 a barrel between the summer of 2008 and early 2009 amid the financial crisis: The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. dropped by more than half. Yet production, on a trailing 12-months basis, merely dipped from about 5.1 million barrels a day to 5 million—before starting the surge toward the current level of about 8.5 million. Similarly, while the U.S. rig count collapsed by 85% between 1981 and 1986, output didn’t start falling sustainably until February 1986.

In failing earlier to stop oil running up above $100 a barrel, OPEC let the shale genie out of the bottle. As Bob Brackett at Sanford C. Bernstein writes, a war on shale “simply postpones the date in which a well is drilled.”

Oil’s sudden slide will cause growth in U.S. oil output to slow, but stopping it altogether would take a protracted period of low prices, at least through the end of next year. Even then, the techniques and discoveries already made would simply pass to another set of players—most likely oil majors scooping up distressed exploration and production firms.

Meanwhile, those OPEC members living day to day, such as Venezuela, are likely to be the first big casualties of this war.",REAL
Lights at E.ON Remain Faint,"Cooling towers at an E.ON power plant in Germany. The company plans to spin off its conventional energy business. European Pressphoto Agency

E.ON ’s split into two separate companies may offer more visibility. But it will do little to help investors navigate their way out of the German energy market’s dire straits.

The utilities giant will spin off its conventional energy business to focus on the more stable renewables, distribution and customer solutions capabilities. The move is among the most radical yet in the sector. The company will effectively surgically remove its most troubled parts—namely the nuclear power, gas-fired and coal-fired plants.

The decision is born out of necessity. The German government wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 1990 levels, largely by switching to subsidized wind and solar power rather than relying on existing nuclear energy. As a result of the added capacity and low demand, wholesale energy prices have fallen by about 40% since 2011 to €36 ($45) per megawatt hour, choking profitability for conventional German utilities such as E.ON and RWE.

Energy prices are likely to remain below historical norms. So it makes sense for E.ON to try to focus on the parts of its business with a more stable cash flow and with growth opportunities that mirror inflation. Sanford C. Bernstein estimates that between 70% and 80% of the remaining company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will come from regulated or fixed contractual revenue streams.

Furthermore, E.ON’s demerger might spur competitor RWE to do something similar, opening up the possibility of further consolidation among fossil fuel power generation assets. This could help speed up plant closures and cut capacity.

But after the split, the remaining E.ON will be occupying new territory that comes with a different set of risks. Renewables accounted for only 7% of the company’s 2013 Ebitda, according to Bernstein. Its ability to grow will not only depend on the vagaries of ongoing subsidies, but also on whether E.ON can sell value-added services to customers—something it has yet to succeed at doing.

As for the new company, its ability to attract investors will depend on factors largely outside of its control. Commodity price dynamics could eventually turn in its favor, says Roland Vetter at CF Partners. Or a favorable ruling to the legal challenge against the government for compensation in nuclear plant shutdowns could improve cash flows. But meanwhile, E.ON will need to pump in billions to prop up the credit worthiness of the new company, potentially hurting its own financial flexibility.

E.ON shares jumped 4% Monday and are trading at about 15 times 2015 earnings, compared with 13 times for RWE, according to FactSet. With much remaining murky, shareholders are better off to wait until more power is restored.",REAL

Gold Rallies After Moody’s Cuts Japan’s Credit Rating,"Gold prices surged on Monday as investors view the precious metal as a haven from uncertainty. Reuters

NEW YORK—Gold prices surged to a one-month high on Monday as a rush of safe-haven buying sparked by Japan’s credit-rating downgrade forced bearish investors to clamor for the exit.

Gold for February delivery, the most actively traded contract, rose $42.60, or 3.6%, to settle at $1,218.10 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was the highest settlement since Oct. 29, when futures closed at $1,224.90 an ounce.

Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s government debt rating by one notch on Monday, sparking a rally in gold during electronic trading overnight. The credit-rating firm flagged delays to planned tax increases as fueling uncertainty about Japan’s ability to reduce its fiscal deficit.

“Any sort of major downgrade raises questions about credit quality, and we’re having a rush back into basics,” said George Gero, a senior vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures.

Gold is viewed by some investors as a safe place to stash their wealth on the belief that the precious metal will retain more of its value than cash or paper assets such as stocks and bonds during periods of instability.

A tumultuous day in the currency markets, which saw the yen and the dollar pull lower, also lent support to gold prices. As the dollar eases, dollar-denominated gold becomes less expensive for buyers using other currencies.

“The dollar being off and Japan being downgraded together is helping push the gold prices back up,” said Thomas Capalbo, a broker with Newedge in New York.

Gold’s gains accelerated as prices broke above $1,190 an ounce, triggering automatic buying orders, brokers said. Bearish traders who wagered on further losses in gold often put automatic buying orders to limit potential losses if the market moves higher.

The flurry of purchases helped gold and silver futures post their biggest one-day gain since Sept. 19, 2013. Silver for March delivery ended 7.3%, or $1.136, higher at $16.692 a troy ounce.

While gold prices have been stabilizing in recent weeks, the number of open contracts has dropped 21% between Nov. 20 and Friday. This is a sign that bearish investors are leaving the market, rather than new buyers flocking to gold, analysts said.

Still, investors won’t know for sure what drove gold prices higher until Monday’s open-interest figures are published on Tuesday, said James Cordier, a principal with Liberty Trading Group.

“All eyes will be on whether these are new longs or previously covered positions,” he said.

The outlook for gold has brightened as a result of Monday’s move higher, Mr. Cordier said. The global economy stands on a firmer footing than it has in years, and with central banks likely to be slow to raise interest rates in 2015, it sets the stage for gold prices to rally, he said.

Platinum futures tracked gold higher, ending near a one-month high. Platinum for January delivery rose 2.5% to $1,241.60 an ounce, the highest since Nov. 3.

How to Lift Weights Without the Pain,"Chris Mittelstaedt, CEO of the Fruit Guys, bench-presses with his trainer Philip Leung looking on. Mr. Mittelstaedt says Mr. Leung helped him develop a consistent strength workout. Jason Henry for The Wall Street Journal

People new to weightlifting often think they should just fight through pain. “That type of mentality isn’t beneficial in the long run. It will catch up to you,” says Chris Matsui, the director of Fusion Performance Training in New York. Injuries occur most often when people push for extra repetitions and sacrifice technique, he says.

When learning a new weightlifting exercise, start with light weights and build up, he says. On a scale of 1 to 10, aim to find a weight that challenges you at the 5 or 6 level. A person should be able to do about 10 repetitions without sacrificing technique if the weight is right.

Proper form involves the entire body, not just the muscle targeted.

When bench-pressing, for instance, “place yourself in the strongest position to be able to drive off,” he says. That includes a slightly arched back, abdominal muscles held tight and the upper back on the bench. People have a tendency to line their elbows up with their shoulders when lowering the weight, but they should remain close to the body, Mr. Matsui says.

Significant increases in weights should happen over weeks and months, not days, he says. The number of repetitions can decrease if necessary to maintain form.

Weightlifting Takes a Load Off a CEO’s Mind,"Chris Mittelstaedt, at Synergy Fitness Studio in San Francisco, can bench-press 315 pounds. Jason Henry for The Wall Street Journal

For Chris Mittelstaedt, lifting weights is a lot like selling fruit. Growing his business and learning to hoist hundreds of pounds both require patience and strategy to see results, he says.

Heavy weightlifting is the workout of choice for the 45-year-old chief executive of the FruitGuys, which stocks company break rooms nationwide with fresh fruit. When Mr. Mittelstaedt started weight training about 10 years ago, he could barely bench-press two 35 pound dumbbells. Now the former college rugby player bench-presses almost double his 165-pound body weight, he says. Working with a trainer, he spent the past two years increasing the weight he bench-presses from 225 pounds to 315.

The FruitGuys started delivering fruit in 1998 to about a dozen companies from a handful of farms. The San Francisco company now delivers to about 6,000 companies from some 400 farms across the U.S.

Mr. Mittelstaedt lifted weights in college to get in shape for rugby. Shoulder pain, made worse by carting fruit boxes in the early days of the company, meant he needed a routine that would help him recover from the injury and prevent further problems.

It wasn’t until he met trainer Philip Leung about 10 years ago that he developed a consistent strength regimen. Mr. Leung helped him rebuild his strength while focusing on his form. For instance Mr. Leung taught him to relax his shoulders during pull-ups and not bend his elbows past a 90-degree angle when bench-pressing 135 pounds or more.

Weightlifting gives Mr. Mittelstaedt, who has a 16-year-old son and 14-year-old twin daughters, “an important mental oasis,” he says. “There’s something incredibly clarifying about trying to lift 315 pounds and knowing there’s only one thing you can think about: Lifting 315 pounds so you don’t drop it on your head.”

The Workout

Mr. Mittelstaedt lifts weights twice a week, once at the Bay Club San Francisco and once on Thursdays with Mr. Leung at Synergy Fitness Studio in the city’s Marina District.

On Sundays, he does a “lighter” lifting session. After stretches, he does bench-presses, starting with 95 pounds and building up to 225, at 10 reps each. This warm-up includes shoulder raises with 20 pound dumbbells and lunges to get his legs moving.

Mr. Mittelstaedt’s workout includes shoulder raises with dumbbells. Jason Henry for The Wall Street Journal

Then there are several more rounds of bench-presses, with repetitions at up to 260 pounds and a “drop set” where he gradually decreases the weight to 135 pounds. “By the time I get to that fourth set, 135 pounds feels like an elephant on my chest,” he says.

Between and after the bench-pressing spurts, there is more shoulder and back work with heavier weights than in his warm-up.

To work his core, he uses a kettlebell, which he swings between his legs and switches hands in a figure eight motion. Rounding out his session are triceps exercises and, while standing on a balance board, biceps curls with 35 pound dumbbells. He reduces the weight as he does more sets.

Related How to Lift Weights Without the Pain

On Thursdays with Mr. Leung, he does a similar workout, but the weights are heavier. On those days, his main goal is four sets of 10 reps at a maximum of 315 pounds.

He rests on Monday and tries to get in a cardio session on the treadmill or elliptical machine for about 45 minutes in the days before his Thursday workout.

The Diet

Mr. Mittelstaedt usually starts his day with an apple because it’s light and gives him quick energy, he says. Lunch is a salad and family dinners often involve simple Italian cooking: roasted chicken, homemade sauces and lots of vegetables.

After lifting, he satisfies protein cravings with a soy-based shake or scrambled eggs with olive oil.

The Gear

He wears basketball shorts and usually a Nike, Under Armour or American Apparel T-shirt with Asics running shoes. His weightlifting gloves cost about $20 on bodybuilding.com. His sessions with Mr. Leung are $100 each, and a family membership at the Bay Club is about $300 a month.

Oil Slump Weighs on Markets,"The recent slump in oil prices continued to weigh on global markets Monday, dragging down stocks and hammering the Russian ruble in particular.

The slump in oil prices continued to weigh on global markets Monday, hammering the Russian ruble in particular. Elsewhere, Japan's credit rating was downgraded by Moody's. WSJ's Katie Martin reports. (Photo: Getty)

Brent crude oil dropped more than 3.5% to $67.53 a barrel before recovering to trade around $71.80, as last week’s decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to leave its output target unchanged continued to rattle markets.

Compared with the 13% drop in Brent crude last week, and the particularly abrupt slide on Friday, oil prices were relatively steady Monday but the repercussions of the last week’s move remained intense.

The Russian ruble, closely linked to oil because energy accounts for a big portion of the country’s exports, slumped to a fresh record low of 53.90 to the dollar, more than 5% weaker on the day. Later, the currency picked up from its weakest levels, amid signs of moderate dollar sales by the central bank, according to traders.

The slide in oil is “reinforcing the loss of investor confidence in the ruble,” which has also been beset by concerns over Western sanctions against Russia and the conflict in Ukraine, said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

Piotr Chwiejczak, an emerging-market strategist at BNP Paribas said that he was surprised that Russia’s central bank had not defended the 50 ruble per dollar mark more fiercely.

“I still think that capital controls are pointless but I do think that interest rates need to be a lot higher,” he said.

The Nigerian naira also fell to a fresh record low against the dollar, but other energy-linked currencies proved more resilient, with the Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone rising, having fallen sharply on Friday.

Elsewhere, Stock markets felt the effects of the recent falls in energy prices.

In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 ended the session 0.5% lower.

Energy stocks once again led declines, with oil and gas producers on the index down 0.9%.

Additionally, markets were also weighed down by manufacturing data for the eurozone showing a slower-than-expected pace of expansion in November. Similar data from China also disappointed.

In the U.S., the S&P 500 was trading 0.9% lower and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4% in late European trade, with traders citing weak retail figures for the Thanksgiving weekend.

Retail spending over the Black Friday weekend fell 11%, according to the main industry trade group, a sign that early deals are losing their allure. Separately, data on the U.S. manufacturing sector showed a modest slowdown as well.

Gold prices were also volatile Monday. They initially dropped after Swiss voters rejected a proposal to increase the central bank’s gold holdings. The initiative would have forced the country’s central bank to hold one-fifth of its assets in gold.

Gold fell by 1.7% to $1,155.20 a troy ounce in early European trade before recovering to $1,197.50 an ounce.

Helping offset the pressure on the precious metal after the Swiss vote, India lifted its trade restrictions on gold imports with immediate effect. Given the move by one of the top gold importers, analysts at Barclays said they “expect the floor for gold prices to firm”.

Elsewhere, a downgrade of Japan’s credit rating by Moody’s Investors Service only briefly dented the performance of the yen, which quickly rebounded from a seven-year low against the dollar to rise 0.2%. Although a rating cut often hurts a country’s currency, the yen tends to rise in times of market stress because it is seen by investors as a safe haven.

Brendan Brown, head of economic research at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities International, also said that the Moody’s move was largely priced in and that the muted market reaction was therefore not surprising.

There are many reasons to be worried about Japan but this credit rating cut is certainly not one of them,” he said.

The Nikkei stock index had closed for the day before the announcement, up 0.8% at a seven-year high.

Back in Europe, investors are looking ahead to Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting, with expectations building that officials will signal a strong intention to expand their asset purchase program to try and boost anemic rates of inflation and jump-start a flagging economy.

Weakness in commodities has acted as a drag on prices, piling further pressure on central bankers in the eurozone and elsewhere to take action.

“The immediate focus will remain on cheaper oil; good news for consumers and for those companies benefiting from reduced input cost pressures, less so for central bankers wrestling with disinflationary concerns,” said Ian Williams, an economist and strategist at brokerage Peel Hunt.

Government bonds in the eurozone hit fresh record highs amid expectations of further ECB easing. Germany’s 10-year yield dipped just below 0.7% in early trade, a new low. Yields fall as prices rise.

Moody’s Changes Amazon’s Outlook to Negative,"Moody’s Investors Service MCO -0.34% on Monday lowered its outlook for Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN -1.22% credit rating to negative from stable after the online retailer said it would issue a “substantial” level of new senior unsecured notes.

Moody’s, however, affirmed Amazon’s medium investment-grade Baa1 rating, as the company’s “excellent liquidity provides sufficient cushion,” the credit ratings firm said.

Shares of Amazon fell nearly 3% in early trading Monday.

Moody’s said it took into consideration Amazon’s dominant position in the online retail space, but said that the company faces growing competition from traditional retailers who work to broaden their online businesses.

The firm also said it is unlikely that Amazon’s rating would move up in the near- to midterm as the company’s expense levels are “likely inflated as a result of significant investments in both technology and SG&A,” weakening its ability to cover interest on debt.

Moody’s said that the new debt will further exacerbate the interest-coverage concerns.

Moody’s action follows Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services’ decision earlier Monday to affirm its stable outlook and high-grade double-a-minus corporate credit rating on Amazon.

"Voices: Clark Kendall, on Firing Your ‘Unruly’ Client","Clark Kendall

Voices is an occasional column that allows wealth managers to address issues of interest to the advisory community. Clark Kendall is founder of Kendall Capital Management in Rockville, Md.

As advisers, we’ve all had challenging or “unruly” clients; those clients who call at all hours demanding to know why their portfolio doesn’t include this one stock, or insist on questioning every transaction in their portfolio. To us the key to dealing with these unruly clients is simple: remaining committed to our investment philosophy and being proactive in communicating that approach.

At our firm, we have a fundamentally disciplined investment process. This year, for example, we’ve not gone after some of those bigger-name securities like Alibaba, GoPro , or Tesla. From our perspective, they’re terribly overvalued.

We tell clients who are itching to add those securities that we see a lot of the same characteristics in this market that we did in 1999. We didn’t chase Qualcom or Cisco which were hot then. But just years later, when the tech bubble burst, that patience was rewarded. Our goal, we explain, is not to beat the S&P 500—it’s to determine what our clients need to retire and develop the right strategy to get them there.

Rather than wait to deliver that message when our clients express concern, we like to get out in front of them. By that I mean emphasizing our disciplined process in anticipation of any market correction. We confront potential volatility and explain how our particular strategy is suited to address it. We take the same approach to those clients who want us to change our strategy based on their own hunches or research.

In those cases, I commend the client’s passion for investing before explaining why we make our investment choices. If you’ve developed a real trust there, the client will more than likely understand. If the client really wants to dictate every purchase and sale in their portfolio, we’ll move them into a separate, unmanaged account. And at that point they’re on their own. It’s not fair to the rest of your clients to let one person jeopardize all of your time and energy.

For clients who struggle to understand that decision, I like to compare our work building financial plans to that of building a house. When my wife and I built our home 15 years ago, we presented the builder with a drawing of what we wanted the house to look like and include. His message: ‘I see what you’re trying to accomplish, but to make this house structurally sound, these are some changes I need to make.’

That’s our job as wealth managers—taking people’s goals and using our expertise to help those people reach them. My wife and I had faith in our builder to execute our vision. He didn’t need to show us the wiring diagram he was using for each room or the kind of nails he was using on the roof. If clients want to get involved at that level, though, if they think they can build the house on their own, we have to let go and allow them to do that.",REAL

"Vonnegut: A Bonus, Then a ‘Bagel Paycheck’","You’re pinching yourself. Hoping it’s not a dream. A branch manager from the evil empire just offered you $1.4 million to join his wirehouse.

It gets better. If you hit Darth Vader’s annual revenue targets, you’ll earn additional bonuses of $500,000 in each of the first three years. He’s pitching you $2.9 million in potential upside.

Nice.

All that money is a beautiful thing, like the new S-Class Mercedes you’ve now got your eye on. What can possibly be wrong with $2.9 million in cold, hard...employee forgivable loans?

“Bagel paychecks,” for one, says Paul Spitzer. He’s CEO of Advanced Practice Advisors, a California-registered investment adviser with $330 million in assets under management.

The upfront money is deceptive, warns Mr. Spitzer. As principal and interest are forgiven on an EFL, they generate ordinary income. And the ensuing taxes can reduce your take-home pay to zero.

Like a big, fat bagel.

Let’s say you’re a $1 million-a-year producer who says yes to that offer. You sign a $1.4 million EFL, at 5% interest, amortized over 10 years. Then--uh oh--assets are slow to follow, and so you generate only $500,000 in your first year at the new shop.

Uh-oh is right. Your after-tax income goes negative.

I’m making some more assumptions here, including a 40% payout on revenue and a 50% total in federal and estate income tax on that payout--not unreasonable rates for lots of advisers. So let’s look at the numbers:

Forgiven interest adds up to $70,000 and forgiven loan principal to $140,000, so you get $210,000 in noncash income. Add $200,000 from the payout and you get $410,000 in total income.

Taxes on that total come to $205,000. That’s $5,000 more than you’ve gotten in pay for the year. That’s a bagel paycheck.

Mr. Spitzer, who once took a signing bonus to change broker-dealers, says the take-home situation is worse when you factor in alternative minimum taxes, overhead charges or reduced payouts on, say, small accounts or discounted trades.

He calls EFLs “a 10-year sentence with no parole.”

Yes, you did get the $1.4 million signing bonus upfront. And that is a lot of money.

But let’s compare what a $1 million-a-year producer adviser would earn over 10 years by staying put versus taking a check and moving to a different wirehouse.

I’m assuming no difference in payouts between firms, and that the breakaway adviser keeps 75% of premove production but never hits Darth Vader’s targets. Consequently, there are no bonuses beyond the initial $1.4 million.

You know the old saying. Hope for the best. Prepare for the worst.

I wanted to understand the economics of a disappointing move. After all, it’s advisers who put their careers on the line when they change firms, not the shops that hire them.

My initial conclusion: Take the check but forget the Mercedes. Even if you’re “bageling” and find it necessary to eat into that signing bonus, you come out way ahead.

Wealth-management businesses are leaky buckets. Advisers lose important clients all the time, so an upfront payment is like a put option against the future loss of clients. Saying “yes” to the signing bonus is one to share business risk with somebody else.

Then again, career decisions aren’t just about the money. Danny Sarch, president of a recruiting firm that specializes in adviser transitions, notes that during 2014, “less than half of the advisers who leave wirehouses will move to another wirehouse.”

“They’re tired of being told what to do,” he explains.

I remember.

Many big producers are moving to independent broker dealers like HighTower Advisors or LPL Financial , in part because they can. Their client loyalty, Mr. Sarch says, “is much stronger than ever before.”

Can advisers control their destinies at independent broker dealers any more than they can at wirehouses?

Not according to Mr. Spitzer. To obtain true freedom, he believes financial advisers must go off the W-2 grid. That means owning their own shop, taking advantage of the many tax advantages that accrue to owners, and finding a solution for the administrative minutia of running a business.

What if you’re not ready to take that risk? Should you take the check from the wirehouse, stay put, go indie, or flee to an RIA?

It depends. If you’re at the start of your career, stay put. Moving a business from one shop to another is a grisly, exhausting experience that eats time and limits your ability to grow.

In your shoes I’d play the long game, tell Darth Vader to get lost, and throw all my energy into finding new clients rather than running what-if scenarios about greener pastures.

But let’s say you’re a well-established veteran, that all your new business comes from referrals and retirement’s not too far away. It might be time to crunch the numbers, to think long and hard about that put option.

Profiting from Standard Chartered’s Pain,"Derivatives investors are betting on the cost of protecting Standard Chartered bonds against default. European Pressphoto Agency

Sometimes bad debts can make good bets. Standard Chartered STAN -2.10% shareholders have endured unwelcome news about weaker profits and higher bad debts. But that has presented an opportunity in derivatives market for those betting on the cost of protecting Standard Chartered bonds against default.

The credit default swap market allows investors to express a view about the relative riskiness of a company versus its rivals—and to try to profit from those views.

At first sight, debt investors look less concerned than shareholders. The bank’s stock dropped 15% between Oct. 24 and Oct. 30, around when Standard Chartered reported an 86% leap in bad loan losses. However, the cost of protecting its bonds against default for five years rose just 8% from the equivalent of $86,000 annually per $10 million of bonds to $93,000, according to data from Markit.

The story is similar since this year’s first profit warning in late June. Standard Chartered stock is down 25% since June 25 while its cost of protection is up 15% from $82,000 annually to $94,000 now.

However, the moves in Standard Chartered’s credit have been much bigger when looked at versus rivals.

Buying protection on one bank and selling it on another is a good way to capture profits from the relative moves in the cost of protection.

Some have played Standard Chartered off against Barclays in this way. In late July, Standard Chartered’s cost of protection was just $6,000 more annually for $10 million of bonds than that of Barclays. Now, that difference has ballooned to more than $40,000.

Going back two years, the difference is even more radical: over that time, Barclays has sold businesses and slashed its balance sheet while doubts about Standard Chartered’s strength have increased. In November of 2012, Barclays’ cost of protection was more than $50,000 higher than Standard Chartered’s. Any investor who captured that kind of swing will have done very well.

Sophisticated investors who expect more bad news from Standard Chartered in the months ahead, especially as other European banks clean up their acts, could stand to profit further from these kinds of trades.

There is a catch. Serious trouble at Standard Chartered could force the bank to raise equity, making its debt less risky and sharply reducing the cost of protection. Higher bad loan losses in its commercial book beyond the roughly $1 billion expected would eat further into the bank’s capital cushion, which is currently about $2.5 billion above the minimum level the bank should not breach.

Standard Chartered is determined to avoid a rights issue. Tapping equity investors would almost certainly push Chief Executive Peter Sands out the door.

That means these kinds of relative credit trades could stay interesting—at least until Standard Chartered can show credit is improving in emerging markets. And while India may be turning a corner, the pain in other Asian markets is only just beginning.

The cost to protect Standard Chartered’s bonds against default in the CDS market closed at $94,000 per $10 million of bonds on Friday. Due to incorrect prices being supplied by the data provider, an earlier version of this story said that the cost was $85,000. (Dec. 1, 2014)",REAL

Cybersecurity and data breaches have become high-profile concerns for businesses and consumers alike. A recent report from Deloitte said that more than 90% of user-generated passwords are vulnerable to hacking. Last year, Experian PLC found that the average user used only five different passwords for 26 accounts.

Last year, Target Corp. was the victim of a massive data breach that affected 70 million people. Just recently, Home Depot Inc. said that it is facing at least 44 civil lawsuits related to an April data breach that compromised 56 million credit-card accounts and about 53 million email addresses.

Ping An Patches Leaky Banking Ship,"A cleaner wipes a glass door as a woman walks past a Ping An Bank branch in Wuhan, Hubei province. Reuters

Investors seem overly sanguine about a massive capital raising by Ping An Insurance . They should be more wary of funds leaking into its banking unit sinkhole.

The insurer, whose name in Chinese roughly translates to “safe and sound,” said Monday it will raise $4.8 billion in a private placement of shares to still-unknown buyers. The placement is at a nearly 5% discount to the last trading price. Despite the dilution to existing shareholders and the discount, Ping An shares traded flat Monday and are up 5.4% since it announced regulatory approval of the share sale last month.

Ping An said the deal was to replenish capital, but the company’s insurance operations are already well capitalized with a solvency ratio of 187% at end-June, well above a 150% regulatory minimum.

Part of the motivation may be to fund its support for the not-so-sound Ping An Bank, a listed subsidiary. In July, the insurance group committed to buy up to 17 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) of common and preferred shares in the bank as part of the bank’s broader capital raising. The transaction hasn’t yet closed.

Unlike the insurance group, one of China’s biggest, Ping An Bank needs the money. Its Tier 1 ratio of just 8.8% at the end of September is below that of most peers. China will impose a minimum 8.5% ratio on banks of its size by 2018, but most banks have sought to reassure investors by keeping capital levels at least a full percentage point above minimum levels.

After raising capital from its parent and others, Ping An Bank should hit a Tier 1 capital ratio of over 10%, says Bernstein analyst Linda Sun-Mattison. But the bank also has relatively large off-balance-sheet exposures compared to peers, which if brought back onto the books could push the ratio lower again, she added.

Ping An Insurance trades at 1.9 times book value, compared with 2 times for China Pacific Insurance and 2.2 times for China Life Insurance. This discount looks justified given its linkage to an underperforming bank. As China’s banking cycle matures, Ping An Bank could find itself looking up to its insurance parent for another capital top up.

Top Samsung Executives Remain in Roles Amid Management Changes,"SEOUL—Samsung Group announced annual management changes at its business units on Monday but said top executives at its flagship unit, Samsung Electronics Co. , will remain in their current positions as the company seeks to reverse recent profit declines.

Samsung Electronics’ mobile business head, J.K. Shin, the chief of the company’s consumer electronics unit, B.K. Yoon, and the current chief executive for the component business, Kwon Oh-hyun, will all maintain their positions, Samsung said.

But D.J. Lee, one of Mr. Shin’s top lieutenants as president and head of sales and marketing at the company’s mobile unit, is leaving his current position, people familiar with the matter said Monday, taking responsibility for lackluster smartphone sales.

It wasn’t immediately clear who would replace Mr. Lee. When contacted by phone, Mr. Lee declined to comment.

The departure of Mr. Lee would remove one of the mobile division’s few public figures. When Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy Note 4 smartphone during the IFA trade show in Berlin in September, it was Mr. Lee, 58 years old, who took the stage instead of Mr. Shin to showcase the new device.

One of the people said other mobile division executives are bracing for more job cuts, news that could trickle out later this week.

Local media reports said two more president-level executives at the mobile unit were ousted from their positions, together with Mr. Lee, as a part of the latest reshuffle. A Samsung spokeswoman declined to comment.

“J.K. Shin has made big contributions in making Samsung Electronics the No. 1 maker of mobile phones,” June Lee, the head of corporate communications at Samsung’s Corporate Strategy Office, told a group of reporters at a briefing following the announcement. “The scope of personnel reshuffling is narrower than it has been before,” he said, noting that it wasn’t just Samsung Electronics but a number of other affiliates that reported relatively weak results this year.

Mr. Shin has overseen the company’s mobile division since 2009, when it began its rapid ascent in the smartphone market, overtaking Apple Inc. and outselling every other smartphone manufacturer.

But in the past year, Mr. Shin has also been under pressure as the company has suffered sharp smartphone declines. Samsung Electronics’ operating profit fell 60% in the third quarter from a year earlier, due mainly to stiff competition from Chinese rivals.

People familiar with matter told The Wall Street Journal earlier that Samsung was considering a leadership shake-up that could, in one scenario, involve Mr. Shin not overseeing the mobile division and Mr. Yoon adding control of the mobile division to his duties.

In one change announced Monday, Hong Won-pyo, the president and head of Samsung’s Media Solution Center, which oversees the development of software and services, was named the president and head of the company’s global marketing strategy office.

His departure as head of MSC has spurred concerns that there could be a partial movement of more than 1,000 employees working to churn out new apps running on Galaxy smartphones to other parts of the company, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Lee of Samsung Group said a review is under way to improve MSC without dismantling the center, though he declined to comment further.

Overall, the scale of the annual reshuffle was smaller than expected. Analysts said that may be because Chairman Lee Kun-hee, who is perceived to typically play a vital role in key management decisions, remains in the hospital after suffering a heart attack in May.

Samsung executives are likely to have found any big change in the management an “uncomfortable” decision to pull through with, because the chairman is still lying ill after the heart attack, said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst with IBK Securities in Seoul.

“Samsung did make a fast move in tackling the smartphone market and did a good job of making money [for a while] and I think [J.K. Shin] has earned that much time for himself,” Mr. Lee of IBK said.

"At This Conference, Scientists Spout Bogus Theories on Bugs, Yawns and Belly Fat","Zach Weinersmith, creator of a Web comic that often uses scientific themes, founded the BAHFest conference. Christina Xu

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.—At a recent scientific conference here, Justin Werfel, a Harvard University researcher who has studied termites in Africa, described to the crowd his theory on why bugs are so disgusting.

It is all about evolution, Dr. Werfel said. Increased competition among humans for food drove bugs to become ever more disgusting to keep people from eating them, he said.

Dr. Werfel used standard scientific methodology to develop his theory. His goal wasn’t to break new ground in entomology. It was to take top place at the Festival of Bad Ad-Hoc Hypotheses, or BAHFest, a satirical conference on evolutionary biology held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Six presenters, each armed with reams of research, vied to win over a panel of judges with a different bogus scientific theory. The winner got a statue of Darwin looking dubious—shoulders shrugging, hands turned upward.

“The lure of having that trophy on my desk at work is a very powerful one,” said Dr. Werfel. His research to develop tiny robots that can build complex systems was inspired in part by the mound-building termite colonies of Namibia and featured on the cover of the journal Science earlier this year.

Darwin statue

BAHFest, now in its second year, drew about 1,000 fans of science and pseudoscience to MIT’s Kresge Auditorium on a Saturday night in October. The presenters spent 10 minutes each describing fake evolutionary theories while citing real scientific evidence.

They were quizzed on their research by a panel of four judges, who graded them on factors including creativity, scientific credibility and delivery. An applause meter registered the audience’s enthusiasm, which also figured in the scores.

BAHFest was founded by Zach Weinersmith, a 32-year-old cartoonist in Davis, Calif., who regularly uses scientific ideas in his Web comic “Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal.” In one of his comics, a fictional biologist theorized that babies are pudgy and football-shaped because our ancient ancestors punted them from village to village to spread their genes.

When Mr. Weinersmith broached on social media the idea of taking tongue-in-cheek science from the comic strip to an actual event, he got lots of positive responses from within scientific circles, he said. Proposals from prospective presenters started coming in. These are reviewed by a team including a science writer and Mr. Weinersmith’s wife, Kelly, a Ph.D. student at University of California, Davis, studying parasitology. The event’s popularity led the couple to add a second BAHFest in San Francisco in October.

To support his idea for why insects are so disgusting, Dr. Werfel began a month before the event to gather photos and illustrations of insects dating back to the late 1700s. He arranged them in a randomized order and solicited help from a few dozen colleagues to rate how disgusting they were.

The research found that observers’ “disgust reaction” increased as the age of the bugs got closer to modern times. And the rate of increase was in almost perfect proportion to human population growth.

“Lest someone at Harvard read this, I would not want them to know exactly how much effort I put into my project. But let’s just say it was a lot,” Dr. Werfel said.

Hopi Hoekstra, an evolutionary geneticist at Harvard and one of the BAHFest judges, was impressed by Dr. Werfel’s theory about why insects look the way they do. “If you had heard an idea like this at an evolution meeting, it could have passed as something that was a bit kooky, but maybe not wrong,” Dr. Hoekstra said.

Barbara Vreede, a postdoctoral researcher in evolutionary biology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, gathered data for a presentation subtitled “Influenza Knows When You’re Doing Yoga.”

Viruses and bacteria evolved to prevent humans from using vaccines and antibiotics, which would suppress them, she said. As part of her fake hypothesis, she theorized that at the first sign the human host is doing a downward-facing dog, for instance, the pathogens become dormant. That temporarily delays the illness’s progression and leads the person to believe the yoga was a cure.

Dr. Vreede cited real evidence of microbes manipulating a host, such as a particular fungus that causes ants to move to an environment the invader prefers, as well as research on “quorum sensing,” or how bacteria communicate among themselves to determine when sufficient numbers are present to mount an attack.

The question of why we yawn is one of “the enduring mysteries of human physiology,” says Emma Kowal of Harvard University. Her bogus theory attempted to provide the answer.

Flying insects are high in protein. They gather in dense swarms most frequently at dawn and dusk, not-so-coincidentally the times of day when we are most likely to yawn.

Therefore, she says, “these insects served as an alternative protein source for our hunter-gatherer ancestors, with yawning as the primary gathering mechanism.” In other words: We evolved to yawn to catch bugs to eat.

Ms. Kowal, a senior studying chemical and physical biology, cited as evidence everything from our chemical response (“after we yawn, there’s a spike in cortisol levels, which is a mark of hunger”) to the way our faces distort (“eyes shut so insects won’t get in, mouth open as wide as possible to maximize capture”).

The winner of the BAHFest trophy wasn’t a scientist at all. Michael Anderson, a Boston lawyer specializing in First Amendment cases, sought to explain the ubiquity of belly fat in middle-age men.

His conclusion: In ancient times, men’s “spare tires” served as a flotation device for them to rescue their families in times of flooding. Primitive art supports the theory, he said. The earliest depictions of humans were mainly stick figures. But when people began to settle down near rivers and other bodies of water, human images began to take on abdominal bulges, Mr. Anderson claimed.

Mr. Anderson’s amusing delivery was a hit with the audience. It also helped make up for his limited scientific credentials in competing against evolutionary biologists with well-honed research skills. “In the era of Google Images and Wikipedia, all things are possible,” he said.
