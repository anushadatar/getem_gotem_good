Australia Woes Boost Rate-Cut Bets,"The Australian dollar remains elevated, presenting a challenge for the central bank as it seeks to cushion the economy from lower growth in China and a slowdown in mining investment. Bloomberg News

SYDNEY—Tumbling commodity prices and signs of slowdown in China have reversed bets on the chances of an Australian rate cut next year.

As recently as two weeks ago, financial markets were pricing in a negligible chance of interest rates—currently at a record low to help spur a weak economy—moving up or down for at least the next year.

But after weak Chinese manufacturing data, Japan diving into recession, and a continuing decline in the price of Australia’s biggest export, iron ore, markets are factoring in a 71% chance of a rate cut in late 2015 and a 50% likelihood of one even earlier, analysis of the interest rate swap market showed.

At the start of the year, the consensus expectation was for a rate rise sometime next year.

Australia’s central bank left its policy rate at 2.5% on Tuesday, as expected, to help cushion the economy against the end of a mining-investment boom, while indicating it intends to keep it low for some time yet. The last time the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates was in August 2013, at the end of a long string of gradual reductions dating back to late 2011.

Until now, economists had virtually ruled out the chance of rates dipping any lower before rising again. The current mood in markets comes after a plunge in the price of iron ore, which has tumbled by around 50% since the start of the year to its lowest level since June 2009.

Other commodities have also weakened, including coal, copper and gold, denying resource-rich Australia the stellar export-price boom anticipated after a decade spent investing in mine, port and rail infrastructure.

The current market pricing also reflects a major turnaround from earlier this year when economists were making confident forecasts Australia would recover relatively quickly from the end of the mining boom.

On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank dramatically changed its interest-rate forecasts, saying the fall in commodity prices meant it no longer expected a rate increase in 2016, and that it now saw two quarter-point rate cuts by the end of next year amid rising unemployment—which would drag the cash rate down to a new record-low of 2.0%.

Adam Boyton, chief economist of the Australian arm of the investment bank, said the central bank would be more open to cutting interest rates now that new regulation restricting lending to property investors was in the offing, lessening the risk of a housing-market crash that could upturn the economy.

Deutsche Bank joins Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse in recently turning significantly more bearish on Australia. Trouble in Australia’s key trading partners, including Japan, has further fed rising doubts about the country’s economic prospects. Growth in China’s manufacturing sector slowed in November, adding to concern that its economy will cool in 2015.

Kieran Davies, chief economist at Barclays , Australia, is among those holding to the belief that the next move in Australian interest rates will be up. However, he said the central bank could afford to keep rates at the current level for longer than he’d originally thought. Mr. Davies pushed back his forecast for a rate increase to the third quarter from the first quarter of next year.

A sharp drop in the Australian dollar, or Aussie as it is known, in recent months against the U.S. currency has given Australia’s commodity exporters some relief from the steep price declines. But on Tuesday, the reserve bank said it wasn’t satisfied the Aussie, which has barely moved against a basket of major currencies, had fallen enough.

“The Australian dollar remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices in recent months,” Gov. Glenn Stevens said in a statement accompanying Tuesday’s decision to hold rates. “A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth.”

Some economists said the comments reflected frustration the currency wasn’t falling fast enough to match sinking commodity prices. The Aussie dollar hit a fresh four-year low US$0.8420 on Monday.

The drop in commodity prices has also thrown the government’s budget off course, forcing revenue write-downs that will impair its ability to deliver a surplus before the end of the decade. Australia is expected to announce reasonably solid growth for the third quarter on Wednesday, but economic activity outside of mining looks set to remain sluggish.

"Obama Calls for Policing Standards, Funding in Wake of Ferguson","President Obama discusses the creation of a task force to promote accountability and transparency between police and communities after the shooting in Ferguson, Mo. Photo: Getty.

WASHINGTON—The White House on Monday defended federal programs that equip local police departments with military gear but called for new standards to guide them, amid criticism that the programs “militarize’’ the police and added to tensions during the protests in Ferguson, Mo.

President Barack Obama said his administration would develop new rules for the programs, adding that more transparency and consistency is needed to ensure that police use the equipment safely. The president, though, isn’t seeking to scale back the programs, and senior administration officials said the focus was on improving oversight.

“We found that in many cases these programs actually serve a very useful purpose,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.

The president also asked lawmakers to fund body-worn cameras and other community policing initiatives at a three-year cost of $263 million. Of that amount, $75 million would be used to buy as many as 50,000 of the cameras, which record police actions.

Monday’s announcements were among the White House’s first prescriptions for building trust between police and communities after the violent protests in Ferguson. They came on a day when Mr. Obama spent much of his time grappling with the fallout of a grand jury’s decision not to indict a white police officer for the fatal shooting in August of an unarmed, black 18-year-old in the St. Louis suburb.

Mr. Obama said Monday that events in Ferguson had laid bare “a simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color.” The steps announced Monday were aimed at ensuring that law-enforcement officials and the communities they serve are partners in battling crime, the president said.

The police response to the protests and violence after the shooting drew attention to federal programs that outfit police with military gear, with critics saying they create mistrust between law enforcement and communities. Supporters say the programs provide useful equipment to police departments that are often strapped for funds.

A review ordered by Mr. Obama, released Monday, reported that the equipment is provided by five agencies, which are governed by a variety of policies. Agencies do little to coordinate efforts and often lack mechanisms to hold police accountable for misusing equipment, the review said.

Mr. Obama directed his staff to draft an executive order to develop common standards for the programs. He said the new standards would ensure that law enforcement agencies aren’t building a militarized culture.

The president had initially sounded a more critical tone when he called for the review in August, saying that “there is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don’t want those lines blurred.”

Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) said Monday the law should be changed to end the transfer of military equipment. “If they quit sending bayonets to police forces it’d be a good start,” Mr. Paul said.

Trevor Burrus, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he was concerned by what appeared to be a lack of political will to take a hard look at the transfers of military equipment to police. “It is possible to constrain these programs with oversight, but it doesn’t seem like many people are really wanting to do it,” Mr. Burrus said. “The gear that they have needs to be reassessed…some of it has no legitimate law enforcement purpose,” he said.

The administration’s review found that local law-enforcement agencies across the country possess 460,000 pieces of property with military attributes, among them night-vision devices, Humvees and mine-resistant vehicles.

The president also plans to issue an executive order creating a task force on policing, which will look at ways to reduce crime while building public trust, officials said. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey and Laurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University and a former assistant attorney general, will lead it, officials said.

Mr. Obama’s funding request would increase the use of body-worn cameras, expand training for law-enforcement agencies and take other steps aimed at improving community policing, senior administration officials said.

Jim Bueermann, president of the nonpartisan Police Foundation, praised the push for thousands more body-worn cameras, saying they are the best available technology that could help answer questions about particular interactions with police. Still, cameras alone aren’t a panacea, he said.

“This is really about the public’s confidence in the police,” Mr. Bueermann said.

President Obama pushes for a $200 million community policing initiative in the wake of the shooting in Ferguson, Mo., which includes body cameras. WSJ’s Colleen McCain Nelson joins the News Hub. Photo: Getty.

The administration will ask for the money that would fund the community policing initiative to be included as part of an omnibus spending bill that would keep the government running after its current funding expires Dec. 11. Leaders of both parties had hoped to pass the omnibus bill, which ties together 12 individually tailored spending bills that would fund agencies through September 2015, but it wasn’t clear that they had the votes to do so in the GOP-controlled House.

Mr. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met Monday afternoon with several members of the cabinet, young people involved in civil-rights issues and, separately, with elected officials, religious leaders, law-enforcement officials and others to discuss how police departments and citizens can work together to improve relations. Those invited to the White House included the mayors of New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Milwaukee and Gary, Ind.

The meetings came one week after a grand jury cleared Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in an investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown. Mr. Wilson resigned from the force over the weekend.

A federal investigation into whether Mr. Wilson or the Ferguson Police Department violated federal civil-rights laws is ongoing.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, speaking in Atlanta Monday night, said the Justice Department would soon announce new profiling guidance for federal law enforcement. Mr. Holder said the guidance “will institute rigorous new standards—and robust safeguards—to help end racial profiling, once and for all.”

Mr. Holder, whose remarks were briefly interrupted by protesters, spoke during a meeting with African-American church leaders and law-enforcement officials at Ebenezer Baptist Church, the congregation once served by Martin Luther King Jr.

Mr. Holder’s visit to Atlanta was the first of several community meetings that he plans to attend to discuss African-American relations with law enforcement following the protests over Ferguson.

Demonstrations continued Monday, as the advocacy group Ferguson Action helped coordinate some 40 walkouts and demonstrations on campuses and in cities across the U.S. on the anniversary of Rosa Parks’s arrest for refusing to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Ala.

“It sends a message that 59 years after Rosa Parks that small, coordinated action can send a big message,” said Mervyn Marcano, spokesman for Ferguson Action. “There are simple and easy ways for people to plug in and show they connect with Ferguson.”

Hackers Targeted Companies’ Merger Talks,"Cyberthieves may be targeting those involved in mergers, acquisitions and other market-moving events. WSJ's Brian Fitzgerald and Simon Constable discuss. Photo: iStock/jaminwell

A group of cyberthieves may be attempting to gain an edge on Wall Street by targeting chief financial officers, advisory firms and others involved in mergers, acquisitions and other market-moving events, according to computer security firm FireEye . FEYE -0.28%

In one case, the group focused on employees privy to changes in closely watched government-reimbursement rates at a publicly traded health-sector firm. In another, hackers posed as an adviser to one of two companies in a potential acquisition.

Since the middle of last year, these hackers penetrated more than 100 companies that are either publicly traded or advising publicly traded firms, FireEye said. Most of the targets are health-care or pharmaceutical companies, FireEye said; it declined to name specific firms.

FireEye said it alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation of its findings during the past week.

The FBI declined to comment.

“There’s nothing else that this could have been going after other than to game the market,” said Jen Weedon, a manager at FireEye’s Mandiant unit, best known for researching foreign hackers.

On multiple occasions, FireEye said the group targeted several parties involved in the same business deal, including law firms and consultants. FireEye researchers said they aren’t aware of any irregular trading linked to their findings.

Cyberattacks have long targeted information that could be handy for investors trying to gain a leg up. But former U.S. officials and experts at other security firms say they’ve not seen evidence suggesting hacked information was behind a suspicious trade.

FireEye’s Mandiant team said the newly disclosed hacking activity appears different than hacking that has been linked to foreign governments. Cyberattacks linked to China, for example, also involve stealing nonpublic information from listed companies. But in those instances the intruders try to steal every bit of information they can, sort of like a vacuum cleaner, hoping to figure out what data has value later.

In the recent cases, hackers appear to target specific employees—particularly those with access to potentially market-moving information— and seek specific sets of data, FireEye said. Moreover, it said the hackers appear to speak English.

One common technique, FireEye said, is a simple trick where the hackers embed prompts for Microsoft Outlook usernames and passwords inside corporate documents they send to executives. Once a recipient enters a username and password, hackers can take over an email account, then send emails to other employees who may be working on a deal.

In some cases, they then strike up conversations with other executives, apparently hoping to gain more information, FireEye said.

That’s risky, because imitating another person’s tone on email is difficult. So the hackers used Microsoft Outlook’s filter settings to hide emails to victims that contain the words “hacked,” “phish” or “malware,” FireEye said. The filter would block a message such as, “This email doesn’t sound like you, Bob. You get hacked?”

In one email meant to trick an executive to hand over email account information, the hackers warned that another employee “may have unwittingly divulged confidential company information regarding pending transactions” in a rant posted on an investment message board.

“This smells very different” than Chinese hacking investigated by Mandiant, Ms. Weedon said. She added the hackers could be “home grown” or based in Western Europe.

FireEye’s disclosure Monday comes as the financial services sector has dramatically upped its spending on cybersecurity, which could prove to a boon for companies like FireEye and large consulting firms like Deloitte. Financial services companies plan to boost cybersecurity budgets by a combined $2 billion during the next two years, according to a November report by the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which also provides anti-hacking services.

"Lower Oil Prices Will Help Boost Global Economy, IMF’s Lagarde Says","At the 2014 WSJ CEO Council Annual Meeting, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde explains the impact for falling oil prices on the global economy.

WASHINGTON—International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde on Monday said falling oil prices will help boost economies in the U.S. and across much of the globe, a net positive for a world struggling with slowing growth.

“It is good news for the global economy,” Ms. Lagarde said at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting.

Oil prices tumbled to multiyear lows last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to maintain its production quotas, rather than lowering its output target. Lower oil prices are good for most consumers, who pay less for gasoline, but could squeeze energy companies and the economies of some major producers like Russia and Venezuela.

For the U.S., lower energy prices will help accelerate economic growth to a 3.5% pace next year, Ms. Lagarde said, up from an October forecast of 3.1%.

The U.S. economy has been stuck at around 2% annual growth since the recession officially ended about 5½ years ago—gross domestic product expanded 2.2% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2012.

While the U.S. appears to be a bright spot in the world, other nations are struggling.

The eurozone still faces high unemployment, wary consumers and painfully weak economies among 18 member states. Japan slipped into recession in the third quarter. Emerging economies also have shown signs of trouble. China’s gross domestic product grew by 7.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, its slowest pace in more than five years, and India decelerated to 5.3% from 5.7% the prior quarter.

Europe also is expected to benefit from lower oil prices, though the eurozone also faces a risk of the “new mediocre,” Ms. Lagarde said, describing an economy marked by slow growth, low inflation and high unemployment.

To break out, reluctant political leaders need to adopt more job-friendly labor market reforms, aggressive and innovative monetary policy and other structural reforms, she said.

“Where they are at the moment they need to use all available tools,” Ms. Lagarde said. “They have to get on with it and do it.”

Ms. Lagarde also took Japan to task for slow implementation of fiscal and labor market reforms.

One key area for Japan: opening up its labor force to women and immigrants. “There is no slack in the Japanese economy, so when they do stimulus, when they put money into the construction business for instance, there is nobody to build,” she said.

Falling energy prices won’t help everyone.

“Winners and losers—exporters are taking a hit,” she said.

For Russia, lower prices are “adding to their fragility and their vulnerability,” Ms. Lagarde said.

The Big Number: 13,"13

The number of publicly traded U.S. companies that said they were going private this year.

Record stock prices have curbed the number of companies that leveraged-buyout firms want to take private. Just 13 firms have announced they would go private so far this year. That is the fewest since 2001, when just 10 public companies announced, according to data provider Dealogic.

With stock prices up, “bargains are more difficult to find,” said Richard Peterson, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ. Take-private LBOs totaled $11.6 billion, down 83% from 2013’s year-to-date total of $68.9 billion.

Instead, private-equity firms are increasingly buying specialized divisions rather than their larger parent companies, Mr. Peterson said. Carlyle Investment Management LLC announced it would buy Johnson & Johnson ’s ortho-clinical diagnostics division for $4.15 billion in January.

Low interest rates and high stock prices, Mr. Peterson said, mean investors are “waiting for the pullback that, you know, never happens until something cataclysmic happens and then everything gets swept down.”

Some companies are willing to sell only low-performing divisions, he said, mentioning Procter & Gamble Co.’s agreement last month to sell Duracell to Berkshire Hathaway for $4.7 billion. A Procter & Gamble spokesman countered that the deal shows a “vote of confidence” in Duracell.

Tibco Software Inc. was the largest company to announce its public departure this year, at $4.3 billion. Telecommunications-equipment company Riverbed Technology Inc. and software firm Compuware Corp. will do the same in deals valued at $3.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.

But those deals are dwarfed by last year’s largest. H.J. Heinz Co. went private in a $27.5 billion leveraged buyout, and Dell went off the market for $24.4 billion.

Supreme Court Weighs When Social-Media Threats Become Criminal Acts,"This case is being watched closely as a test of free speech protections and what counts as a threat in the age of the Internet. Reuters

WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday waded into the question of when a social-media posting rises to the level of a criminal threat, in a case examining a Pennsylvania man’s conviction following comments he made to his estranged wife and others on Facebook.

The closely watched case pits law-enforcement and victims’ rights groups against free-speech advocates, and it could affect how freely individuals can speak online and in traditional forums. To underscore that point, Monday’s hourlong oral argument featured discussions between the justices and lawyers about violent rap music and tweets about the turmoil in Ferguson, Mo.

The justices searched for a middle ground that would protect free speech yet allow prosecutors to target people who make “true threats.” Past Supreme Court rulings have said the government can prohibit such threats, but it hasn’t always been clear what they are.

At issue was the 2011 conviction of Anthony Elonis for posting threats on Facebook against his estranged wife, law enforcement and local elementary schools. Mr. Elonis, who served about three years in prison for the conviction, had written several posts on his Facebook page that discussed harming his wife, including after she obtained a protective order against him.

In one post in the form of rap lyrics, Mr. Elonis wrote, “Fold up your [order] and put it in your pocket/Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?”

Mr. Elonis has said his rap-styled online posts were a “therapeutic” way to deal with his troubles.

Facebook isn’t a party to the case and declined to comment on Monday. Facebook and other social-media sites such as Twitter and YouTube have rules for managing individual speech online and enjoy legal protections from liability for material posted by users.

The court took the case to decide what prosecutors must prove to win a conviction against someone charged with making criminal threats. The justices considered several possible legal standards. Should prosecutors have to show a defendant intended to threaten someone? Does the defendant at least have to know his comments would cause the target of his communications to feel threatened? Or is it enough, as prosecutors argued, that a “reasonable person” would perceive an Internet posting as a threat?

John Elwood, a lawyer for Mr. Elonis, said prosecutors should have to show that someone accused of making threats intended to put the listener in fear. Merely being reckless with comments on Facebook or elsewhere shouldn’t be enough to make someone guilty, he said.

“Many of the people who are being prosecuted now are teenagers who are essentially shooting off their mouths or making sort of ill-timed, sarcastic comments which wind up getting them thrown in jail,” Mr. Elwood said.

He cited a Texas prosecution of a teenager who made remarks in a videogame chat room about attacking a school. And he suggested the government’s preferred legal approach would allow the prosecution of someone from Ferguson who tweeted a violent message along with a picture of police officers during the riots.

Mr. Elwood’s arguments drew sharp responses from some justices. Justice Samuel Alito said Mr. Elonis’s position “sounds like a road map for threatening a spouse and getting away with it.” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned how prosecutors could prove what was in someone’s mind when they made allegedly threatening Internet posts.

Justice Alito also raised concerns about one of Mr. Elonis’s Facebook posts that talked about shooting a kindergarten class, reading it to the courtroom during the arguments session: “Enough elementary schools in a 10-mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined/And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class/The only question is…which one?”

The justice questioned whether it made sense to require juries to “get into the mind of this obsessed, somewhat disturbed individual” to try to determine whether he really meant to threaten.

The federal government’s position also ran into trouble. Justice Elena Kagan said the government’s proposed standard seemed to be that someone could be guilty if he should have known that his posts would cause someone to feel threatened. She said that standard was too low. “That’s not the kind of standard that we typically use in the First Amendment,” she said.

Justices Kagan and Stephen Breyer signaled they were considering an approach that didn’t fully embrace either side’s arguments. Justice Anthony Kennedy raised the possibility the case could be sent back for new trial-court proceedings with different jury instructions.

Chief Justice John Roberts, meanwhile, asked whether the government’s approach potentially would expose rap artists to prosecution for songs containing violent threats in them. The chief justice quoted lyrics from an Eminem song about a domestic dispute that Mr. Elonis’s lawyers cited in their written brief. Mr. Roberts noted the lyrics included, “Da-da make a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake,” and “There goes mama splashing in the water, no more fighting with dad.”

Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben said juries need to consider the context for allegedly threatening statements. Eminem’s rap songs are a form of entertainment, while Mr. Elonis’s posts weren’t, he said.

Mr. Elonis “knows that his wife is reading these posts. He knows that his posts, despite the fact that they’re in the guise of rap music, have instilled fear in her,” Mr. Dreeben said.

In 1969, the court threw out the conviction of a man who said at a public rally that if he were drafted into the Army and forced to carry a rifle, “the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J.”

In 2003, the court ruled Virginia could criminalize cross-burning “done with the intent to intimidate,” because of its long history as a signal of impending violence.

A decision in Elonis v. U.S. is expected by the end of June.

Memory Chip Makers to Merge,"Cypress Semiconductor Corp. CY -5.12% and Spansion Inc., two Silicon Valley companies known for memory chips used in many consumer and business technologies, agreed to combine in a deal that values Spansion at about $1.6 billion.

The deal will unite complementary technologies that go unseen by most people but are crucial for the proper functioning of car-braking systems, hand-held medical devices and storing software in cellphones. Cypress specializes in a variety of memory chips called SRAM, and Spansion is in a type called NOR flash.

The companies said the deal was a “merger of equals” with shareholders in Cypress and Spansion each slated to own half the stock in the merged company. T.J. Rodgers, the chief executive of Cypress, will be CEO of the new company, while Spansion’s Ray Bingham will serve as nonexecutive chairman. Each company will get four board seats, the companies said Monday.

Spansion shareholders will receive 2.457 Cypress shares for each Spansion share they hold.

The all-stock deal valued Spansion at $1.6 billion, or $25.63 a share, based on Cypress’s closing share price Monday of $10.43.

Spansion shares finished regular market trading Monday at $22.85 each, but the stock price rose 14% in after hours trading to $26.

Cypress shares rose 9.8% to $11.45 in after-hours trading.

The companies valued the transaction at $4 billion. A Cypress spokesman wasn’t immediately available to comment.

In an interview, Mr. Rodgers and Spansion CEO John Kispert said the companies had similar corporate cultures and complementary product lines. Mr. Kispert said Spansion has a strong foothold in auto and industrial technology, while Cypress’s strength are in consumer-electronics devices and an emerging area known as the “Internet of Things” that includes clothing or roadways laced with sensors, transmitters or processors.

Spansion and Cypress are survivors in the increasingly competitive world of microcontrollers.

“It’s a no-nonsense mentality that memory companies have to have to survive. Both companies have that,” Mr. Rodgers said.

The companies said Monday that they expect the merger to close in the first half of next year. The combined company will be based in San Jose and keep the name Cypress Semiconductor. The combined company is expected to generate annual revenue of about $2 billion, Cypress and Spansion said.

The deal is expected to generate cost savings of more than $135 million annually within three years and add to per-share earnings—excluding one-time items—in the first full year after the deal closes.

According to a regulatory filing, in the event that either Cypress or Spansion cancel the deal, that company ending the agreement would pay the other firm a termination fee of $60 million and/or reimburse the other company as much as $5 million in expenses.

AOL bought Vidible, a marketplace for online video content that connects content providers and publishers in need of video. Reuters

Financial terms weren’t disclosed.

Philadelphia Mayor Signals Support For Mandatory Sick-Leave Law,"Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter signaled his support for a mandatory sick-leave law Monday, putting the city on track to join three states and 16 other U.S. cities with such requirements, including California and New York City.

“A healthy worker is a happy worker, and it’s a person that’s ultimately going to be more productive and just spreading a lot less stuff around the workplace,” Mr. Nutter said after accepting the report of a 14-member mayoral task force formed to study the issue.

The report calls for the city to require employers with at least 15 workers to provide up to 40 hours of paid sick leave a year. Smaller employers would have to give their workers up to 40 hours of unpaid sick time annually under the recommendations.

The Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce said it would wait for legislation to take a position. “The competitiveness issue is a real one,” said public policy director Joe Grace. “It’s fair to say many members of the chamber—viable businesses in the city—still have concerns about that.”

Mr. Nutter vetoed similar legislation in 2011 and 2013, saying he worried about the impact on city businesses and hiring. He said the strengthened local economy made this a good time to revisit the issue.

The first city to mandate paid sick leave for most employers was San Francisco, in 2006, according to the task force. Since 2011, 14 other cities have imposed similar requirements, as have three states: Connecticut, California and Massachusetts.

The Philadelphia proposal would exempt certain workers, including federal and state employees, those covered by collective bargaining and temporary workers. Enforcement of the requirements should be complaint-driven, the task force concluded.

The mandate, if enacted, would largely affect hotels and restaurants, said task force member Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. The task force estimates that 35% to 40% of city workers, or about 200,000, lack paid sick leave, including many low-income women and minorities.

Mr. Cappelli said providing paid sick leave has a small impact on employer costs, and the absence of such benefits only encourages sick employees to go to work, where they can contribute little.

Another task force member, Pete Ellis, who owns a restaurant called El Fuego, said his 12 workers get paid sick leave. Having a sick worker on duty creates the potential for spreading an infection to other employees and customers, he said.
