Vice President-elect Mike Pence Says Trump Administration Plans Ambitious Agenda,"Vice President-elect Mike Pence waves to workers as he leaves following a speech by President-elect Donald Trump at Carrier Corp. in Indianapolis on Thursday. Photo: Darron Cummings/Associated Press

CINCINNATI—Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Thursday that the incoming Trump administration is planning a burst of activity that would take aim at the gridlock in Washington, pressing forward with its goals to overhaul the tax code, health care and immigration laws.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Pence said President-elect Donald Trump is preparing ambitious 100-day and 200-day plans aimed at fulfilling core campaign promises and jump-starting economic growth.

Asked what might surprise voters about the Trump White House, Mr. Pence said: “I think the only thing that will surprise them is that Washington, D.C., is going to get an awful lot done in a short period of time.”

Mr. Pence spoke in a holding room after introducing Mr. Trump at a rally in Cincinnati, the start of a “thank you” tour in battleground states crucial to the Republican ticket’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in November. As he talked, Mr. Trump could be heard in the background at the U.S. Bank Arena, reviving key lines from his successful campaign stump speeches to enthusiastic cheers.

The agenda laid out by Mr. Pence points to an activist White House that would capitalize on Republican congressional majorities that spent years battling Democratic President Barack Obama.

His comments also suggest that a Trump White House would eschew many of the free-market principles that have guided prior Republican administrations, including injecting itself into the personnel and long-term operating decisions of individual companies.

The new administration’s first priorities would include curbing illegal immigration, abolishing and then replacing Mr. Obama’s signature health-care system, nominating a justice to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and strengthening the military, said Mr. Pence, whose wife, Karen Pence, sat nearby during the interview.

By springtime, the Trump administration would work with congressional leaders “to move fundamental tax reform” meant to “free up the pent-up energy in the American economy,” he said.

Pillars of the tax overhaul would include lowering marginal tax rates, reducing the corporate tax rate “from some of the highest in the industrialized world” to 15%, and repatriating corporate cash held overseas, he said.

Such measures would “benefit American workers and strengthen American incomes,” said Mr. Pence, who will soon relinquish his post as governor of Indiana.

Mr. Pence is positioned to be an active vice president wielding substantial influence in the Trump administration.

Asked if he saw himself in the mold of such previous running mates as Dick Cheney or George H.W. Bush, he said he “can learn a great deal from vice presidents over the last 30 and 40 years. But ultimately I have a firm conviction that the president [Mr. Trump] will define that role. Not me.”

Trump’s Inner Circle The people likely to join President-elect Donald Trump at the White House.

A former congressman, Mr. Pence has made regular trips to Capitol Hill since the election, plotting strategy with legislative leaders. He suggested that part of his value to Mr. Trump is the contacts he has made through years in elective office, both in Washington and at the state level.

“I think those relationships were part of what the president-elect saw that I brought to the team, and at his direction I’m happy to call on those relationships to advance the president’s agenda,” he said.

He described Mr. Trump as a hands-on executive. The pair had come from Indiana, where they celebrated the decision by Carrier Corp., an air conditioning and furnace maker, to retain some jobs in the U.S. rather than relocate them to Mexico.

He said he was in the room when Mr. Trump made phone calls to company officials, describing his plans to make the economy friendlier to business, an argument he said proved persuasive.

Mr. Pence, in a private meeting with Greg Hayes, chief executive of United Technologies Corp. , the owner of Carrier, also offered the company $7 million in state tax incentives over the next 10 years to keep about a third of the 2,100 Indiana workers in the U.S.

United Technologies’ status as a major federal defense contractor also played a role in its decision to appease the incoming administration by not moving as many workers out of Indiana, people familiar with the deal said.

Mr. Trump chose to “speak as one American to another and tell them everything that we said we were going to do,” said Mr. Pence, including “cutting taxes on job creators and businesses, rolling back excessive regulations, repealing Obamacare and having the kind of trade deals that put Americans first.”

Passive Investors Get Sucked Into Hong Kong Market Failures,"Commercial and residential buildings in Hong Kong. Fullshare Holdings fell 11% a day after MSCI added the wildly overvalued property developer into its China index. Photo: Bloomberg News

A controversial report from brokerage house Sanford C. Bernstein in August accused passive investing of being “worse than Marxism.” In a capitalist outpost of the world’s biggest communist country, passive investing can indeed be ominous.

Hong Kong-listed Fullshare Holdings 0607 -1.22% fell 11%, wiping out $1 billion from its market value Thursday, a day after MSCI added the wildly overvalued property developer into its China index. Around the same time it entered the index, Fullshare issued new shares for its acquisition of wind equipment maker China High Speed Transmission . China High Speed shareholders, who received Fullshare shares in the deal, are now dumping them on the market.

Other than the index funds who are forced to buy, there may not be anyone else in town. Four shareholders own around 80% of the company, including the 4.3% owned by Zall Group , another bubbly stock in which Fullshare has an 8.8% stake. Mainland investors, through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, own another 3.4%, or around 20% of its free float.

The scene should already be familiar to Hong Kong investors—multibillion-dollar bubbles with stocks that have small floats but get added to major benchmarks and then collapse. Goldin Properties , one of the stocks that plunged in same spectacular manner the day after Hanergy Thin Film crashed, was added to the MSCI indexes in May last year.

The Hong Kong regulator subsequently warned that 13 shareholders owned around 95% of Goldin. MSCI later decided that companies who got such warnings of concentrated ownership would no longer be included in its indexes and kicked Goldin out in February. Its short nine months in the indexes, however, was enough to inflict an 86% loss on whoever had to follow MSCI’s benchmarks.

Fullshare isn’t on the regulator’s list of stocks with concentration warnings, but some think it should be. Shareholder activist David Webb has petitioned the Securities and Futures Commission to investigate the company’s shareholders.

Making things worse is that shares of Fullshare can’t be shorted due to arcane and paternalistic Hong Kong regulations. Stocks are only eligible for short sales if its daily turnover exceeds 60% of the company’s market capitalization. But as Fullshare’s sevenfold jump since 2015, that threshold looks even more difficult to reach—defeating the whole purpose of using short selling to correct fast-rising stock prices.

The point of passive managed index funds is to not be in the game of picking good stocks over bad. But they should exclude markets and stocks that don’t meet basic investible criteria in the first place. An investor may be wise enough to not buy directly into such bubbles. Passive managers may have no choice.

President-elect Donald Trump Names Gen. James Mattis as Pick for Defense Secretary,"President-elect Donald Trump has picked retired General James ""Mad Dog"" Mattis as his nominee for secretary of defense.

WASHINGTON—President-elect Donald Trump has tapped retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis to become secretary of defense—a choice that requires Congress to pass a special law for the recently retired military officer to take up the Pentagon’s top post.

“We are going to appoint ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis as our secretary of defense,” Mr. Trump said at a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday, referring to the general by a nickname. Mr. Trump’s speech in Ohio was the first stop in a nationwide “Thank You” tour he will conduct over the next few weeks.

The decision brings a longtime military hand, known for his battlefield toughness and intellectual heft, to the lead of the nation’s armed forces as thousands of U.S. troops remain on the ground in Afghanistan and Iraq. Gen. Mattis rose through the ranks of the Marine Corps over 43 years to become the U.S. military’s top commander in the Middle East.

Since retiring in 2013, Gen. Mattis has become a vocal critic of what he calls Washington’s “strategy-free” approach to warfare and threats. He has urged the U.S. to engage in the Middle East more directly and without preset limits on the use of force, echoing critics of President Barack Obama’s administration who say it has taken an overly incremental and fair-weather approach.

Trump’s Inner Circle The people likely to join President-elect Donald Trump at the White House.

He has agreed with Mr. Trump about taking more intensive action against U.S. enemies such as Islamic State but also has articulated views that contradict Mr. Trump’s campaign-trail talking points, setting up potential battles over policy.

Gen. Mattis serves as a director at embattled blood-testing startup Theranos Inc. and is on the board of General Dynamics Corp. , the defense contractor and aerospace firm that builds nuclear-powered submarines, armored vehicles and business jets.

The selection of Gen. Mattis adds to Mr. Trump’s reliance on former military officers for his national-security team. The president-elect chose retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser and is considering Navy Adm. Michael Rogers to become director of national intelligence. He has also spoken to another retired Marine Corps general, John Kelly, about a top administration post.

From the Archive Gen. James Mattis provides insights on the nature and history of war, and explains why these are crucial to understand, in an interview by Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson. Originally published 3/14/15

Most previous secretaries of defense served in the military in some capacity, the majority of them in their youth. U.S. law, however, requires a veteran to be out of uniform for seven years to qualify for the civilian post. Gen. Mattis retired 3½ years ago, meaning Congress will need to pass a special law giving Mr. Trump permission to nominate him.

The only other recently retired general to become secretary of defense since the position’s creation after World War II was George C. Marshall. Congress passed a law to permit his appointment.

Gen. Mattis enjoys widespread popularity on Capitol Hill, where many top lawmakers say they would vote to approve a law to allow for his appointment, but the process will force Congress to address broader questions about civilian control over the military. When Congress passed legislation permitting Gen. Marshall’s appointment in 1950, the law expressly said such a move wasn’t to be repeated.

One Democratic senator said she would oppose a law allowing for Gen. Mattis’s appointment.

“While I deeply respect Gen. Mattis’s service, I will oppose a waiver,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.”

However, Robert Gates, who served as a defense secretary under President Barack Obama as well as former President George W. Bush, defended such an action for Gen. Mattis. Mr. Gates said Gen. Mattis would provide stability for uniformed Americans.

“Normally, I would be concerned about civil-military relationships by having a former senior officer, particularly one so recently in uniform, in that job,” Mr. Gates said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “But Gen. Mattis is so deeply steeped in history and is such a strategic thinker and brings such extraordinary experience to the table, that I think that this would be one time that’s worth making an exception.”

Donald Trump Promises to Usher In New ‘Industrial Revolution’ in Ohio Rally,"President-elect Donald Trump speaks during the first stop of his 'USA Thank You Tour 2016' in Cincinnati. Photo: European Pressphoto Agency

CINCINNATI, Ohio—President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said his administration would usher in a new “Industrial Revolution,” one of numerous promises he made in Cincinnati as he began a nationwide “Thank You” tour following his Nov. 8 election.

Mr. Trump used the 53-minute speech, the first of its kind since he became president-elect, to reflect on his victory but also to outline a number of goals, many of them lofty, for his term as president.

The speech was more than just thematic, however. He said for the first time that on Monday he would announce that he was nominating Ret. Gen. James Mattis as his first secretary of defense.

Mr. Trump promised sweeping changes to trade policy, national security, infrastructure, military spending and immigration. He said he wanted to work with Democrats but said he could get the work done without them, even without his supporters.

“Now that you put me in this position, even if you don’t help me one bit, I’m going to get it done,” he said. “Don’t worry.”

The Cincinnati rally resembled, in some ways, the campaign rallies he held for months as his candidacy gained steam during the year. There were chants of “U.S.A.,” and vendors sold Trump campaign memorabilia. But there was one notable difference: with the election over, the crowd was far smaller, and there were many empty seats in the upper deck of the 18,000-seat arena.

During his speech, he stuck to many of his campaign promises. He said a wall would be built along the U.S.-Mexico border. He said his administration would “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act. He said the Trump administration would seek plans and deals that benefited Americans first and not get duped into deals with other countries.

“There is no global anthem, no global currency,” he said. “We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.”

Mr. Trump, known for his sweeping rhetoric, made some vows that could be difficult to execute, but he said people have routinely underestimated him in the past. Among them:

—He said he would rebuild urban areas that are blighted with crime, and said he would make the murder rate fall by changes to law enforcement policies.

—He said “we will finally end illegal immigration” and “dismantle the criminal cartels, and liberate our communities from the epidemic of gang violence and drugs pouring into our nation.”

—On the economy, he said “we can reverse the stagnation and usher in a period of true opportunity and growth.”

Mr. Trump spoke about steep tax cuts and the removal of numerous regulations that he said were stifling growth.

“People are constantly telling me and telling you to reduce our expectations,” he said. “Those people are fools. They’re fools.”

He focused much of his speech on the economy. Mr. Trump had flown to Cincinnati from Indianapolis, where he had announced a new agreement by United Technologies Corp. not to move 800 manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Mr. Trump said decisions like this would be plentiful during his presidency.

“The era of economic surrender is over,” he said. “We’re going to fight for every last American job. It is time to remove the rust from the rust belt and usher in a new industrial revolution. We’re going to do it.”

People who turned out to see Mr. Trump at his rally said they were pleased by early moves he had taken, including his push to save some of the jobs United Technologies was planning to move to Mexico.

“The fact that he picked up the phone is enough,” said Barry Devine, 62, a retired firefighter from Cincinnati. “He tried. They may lose some jobs up there, but he did save some. It is a positive step.”

Theranos Investor Riley Bechtel Steps Down From Board,"Bechtel Group CEO Riley Bechtel was named as an investor in Theranos in a Wall Street Journal article earlier this week. Photo: Evan Vucci/Associated Press

Theranos Inc. said Riley Bechtel, chairman of the construction giant Bechtel Corp., had retired as a director of the embattled blood testing startup.

Mr. Bechtel has been replaced by Daniel Warmenhoven, former chief executive officer of data-storage firm NetApp Inc. NTAP -0.18% The company said Mr. Bechtel “has health issues,” and that the switch was effective immediately.

Mr. Bechtel was named as an investor in Theranos in a Wall Street Journal article earlier this week. The article identified other wealthy individuals and families that led Theranos’s most recent funding round, including Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of Wall Street Journal parent News Corp .

Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes said in a statement that the firm is “proud to call [Mr. Bechtel] a shareholder and will miss him on our board.”

Theranos said Mr. Bechtel had joined its board in 2014. Mr. Warmenhoven is also a board member at the closely held Bechtel Corp.

Related Big Names Take Hit on Theranos

In a statement issued by Theranos, Mr. Warmenhoven said, “Theranos’ inventions position it to meaningfully contribute to accessible, affordable health care across a broad range of settings.”

“I have confidence in the company’s return to its technology roots, and I look forward to helping guide it to success,” he said.

The company faces serious challenges. Federal health regulators sanctioned it in July, barring Ms. Holmes from the lab industry for at least two years. It faces lawsuits by investors and patients and civil and criminal federal probes.

The company is appealing the sanctions. It has said the suits are without merit and that it is cooperating in the investigations.

In October, it closed it lab testing operations. Ms. Holmes said at the time the company would focus on developing new lab devices to sell commercially that would enable cheaper blood tests to be done on small samples.

On Thursday, the company also announced that it was retiring its board of counselors structure as part of “an ongoing evolution and consolidation of the company’s corporate advisory framework.” The move is effective Jan. 1. A call seeking further detail wasn't immediately returned.

Members of the scrapped counselors group were once part of the board of directors but were shifted to the newly created body in 2015 after critics said that while influential former government officials, they offered little in expertise in the sector.

The advisers included former U.S. cabinet members Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz, as well as former U.S. senators.

It was the grandson of Mr. Shultz, a former secretary of state, who was the first of Theranos’ employees to raise concerns with state regulators of the company’s lab practices.

Twitter Names Keith Coleman as Product Chief,"Twitter's bird logo and related décor at Twitter offices in San Francisco. Illustration: Alison Yin for the Wall Street J

Twitter Inc. TWTR 0.63% on Thursday acquired a small startup and immediately installed its founder as its new product chief, filling a crucial role that’s been vacant for nearly a year.

Keith Coleman, the chief executive of social-networking app maker Yes Inc. and a former Google product manager, will take over as Twitter’s vice president of product. He joins Twitter along with six others from Yes, a two-year-old startup that makes apps including event-planning service Frenzy.

A Twitter spokeswoman declined to disclose the deal price.

The hiring caps a turbulent year for Twitter, which is trying to regain its footing under Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. A revolving door of product chiefs and frequent strategy shifts over the years has stunted Twitter’s ability to evolve the service and appeal to mainstream users.

Mr. Coleman is Twitter’s sixth product chief since 2007 and fourth since the company’s initial public offering in November 2013. Before founding the little-known Yes, Mr. Coleman worked at Alphabet Inc.’s Google, where he oversaw products like Gmail, Inbox and Gchat.

Twitter, whose stock has fallen about 22% this year, has been without a full-time product chief since January, when longtime executive Kevin Weil decamped to run product for Facebook Inc.’s photo-sharing app, Instagram. Mr. Weil was one of four top executives to leave the company at the time. Until now, Twitter technology chief Adam Messinger has been overseeing product.

Mr. Dorsey is under pressure to reinvigorate the company’s sluggish user growth, which has hovered between flat and 2% since he took over as permanent CEO a little more than a year ago. Investors grew more impatient this fall after companies including Salesforce.com Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Alphabet Inc. considered buying Twitter before backing away.

Soon after, Twitter said it would cut 9% of its workforce, shut down its Vine video app and redirect its focus from driving growth to delivering profits. Last month, Adam Bain, Twitter’s well-respected chief operating officer, said he would step down to explore other opportunities. He will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, who has been spearheading the social-media company’s efforts around live video.

Mr. Dorsey has made video central to Twitter’s turnaround effort, aiming to become a prime destination to watch live events. Executives believe there are signs Twitter is turning a corner, with increases in the number of daily users, in time spent on the site, and in impressions over the past couple of quarters, people familiar with the matter say.

Parents Disarm Son Who Brought Guns to Utah School,"Officials respond to Mueller Park Junior High in Bountiful, Utah, after a student fired a gun in a classroom on Thursday. Photo: Ravell Call/The Deseret News/Associated Press

BOUNTIFUL, Utah—Two fast-acting parents disarmed their 15-year-old son at a Utah junior high school Thursday after the teenager brought the family’s shotgun and handgun to school and fired a round into the ceiling of a classroom without injuring anyone, police said.

Bountiful Police Chief Tom Ross said the boy’s mother and father went to Mueller Park Junior High in the northern Utah city of Bountiful when they noticed a handgun and shotgun were missing from their home.

The parents confronted their son at the school and disarmed him, Chief Ross said. He didn’t have details about why the student brought the weapons to the school or what he intended.

Police hadn’t been contacted before about the boy, Chief Ross said.

As the parents intervened, a teacher called 911 and a police officer who happened to be down the street arrived and took custody of the student soon after, police said.

About 840 students in seventh, eighth and ninth grades attend the school, according to state data. Bountiful is a city with a predominantly Mormon population of about 44,000 people.

The incident comes about two weeks after another Utah student stabbed five high-school classmates and himself before he was cornered by school workers, according to police.

In October, a 14-year-old boy shot another teen twice in the head during a fight outside a middle school in West Jordan, about 25 miles south of Bountiful.
