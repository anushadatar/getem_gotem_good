<p>We are  BlindNews,  a team of engineers from the Olin College of Engineering. Our product is a web app that takes URLs inputted by the user, determines whether the article in question contains false information. In our ever-so-connected world, the rate at which information spreads is becoming faster and more wide-spread. Our interconnectedness on the web and the lightning speed at which data is shared creates an environment that makes it very easy for falsehoods and misinformation to spread. Easy access to accurate information on the internet is crucial to the continued success of advancing technology and the success of the human race as a whole. While it is of the utmost importance to minimize the pertinence of fake news, we firmly believe that outright censorship of information is wrong. Our product is aimed at informing viewers about the accuracy of the media they consume, but ultimately leaves the desicion up to them whether they wish to view the article or not.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-solutions.pdf">study</a> from Dartmouth College, it was found that "false headlines are percieved as less accurate when people revieve a general warning about misleading information on social media or when specific headlines are accompanied by a 'Disputed' or 'Rated false' banner. Moreover, it was also found that although "exposure to the 'Disputed' or 'Rated false' banners did not affect the percieved accuracy of unlabeled false or true headlines exposure to a general warning decreased belief in the accuracy of true headlines." From this information it is clear that tagging the article with different metrics is more effective in sueding the opinion of the reader than simply calling the headline 'disputed.' At BlindNews, we want to bring the world closer together much like Facebook and would love to be aquired by them. (*cough-cough*) </p>
