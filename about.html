<p>We are  BlindNews,  a team of engineers from the Olin College of Engineering. Our product, BlindNews, is a webapp that can take URLs for news sources submitted by the user and dynamically determine whether the article in question is fake. In our ever connected society, the rate at which information spreads is astronomical. Our interconnectedness on the web, and the lightning speed at which data is shared, creates an environment that makes it very easy for falsehoods and misinformation to spread. Easy access to accurate information on the internet is incredibly important, which is why we decided to create this program. While it is of the utmost importance to minimize the pertinence of fake news, we firmly believe that outright censorship of information is wrong. Our product is aimed at informing viewers about the accuracy of the media they consume, but ultimately leaves the desicion up to them.</p>
